0	35313388	The genome of viruses classified as picornaviruses consists of a single monocistronic positive strand RNA. The coding capacity of these RNA viruses is rather limited, and thus they rely on the cellular machinery for their viral replication cycle. Upon the entry of the virus into susceptible cells, the viral RNA initially competes with cellular mRNAs for access to the protein synthesis machinery. Not surprisingly, picornaviruses have evolved specialized strategies that successfully allow expression of viral gene products, which we outline in this review. The main feature of all picornavirus genomes is the presence of a heavily structured RNA element on the 5´untranslated region, referred to as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element, which directs viral protein synthesis as well and, consequently, triggers the subsequent steps required for viral replication. Here, we will summarize recent studies showing that picornavirus IRES elements consist of a modular structure, providing sites of interaction for ribosome subunits, eIFs and a selective group of RNA-binding proteins. 
1	35313353	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely involved in plant growth and development. However, the function of circRNAs in plant somatic embryogenesis (SE) remains elusive. Here, by using high-throughput sequencing, a total of 5,029 circRNAs were identified in the three stages of longan (Dimocarpus longan) early SE. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that differentially expressed (DE) circRNA host genes were enriched in the 'non-homologous end-joining' (NHEJ) and 'butanoate metabolism' pathways. In addition, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content during longan early SE was determined. The results indicated that ROS-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) may not depend on the NHEJ repair pathway. Correlation analyses of the levels of related metabolites (glutamate, γ-aminobutyrate and pyruvate) and the expression levels of circRNAs and their host genes involved in butanoate metabolism were performed. The results suggested that circRNAs may act as regulators of the expression of cognate mRNAs, thereby affecting the accumulation of related compounds. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of DE circRNAs, DE mRNAs, DE long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and DE microRNAs (miRNAs) was constructed. The results showed that the putative targets of the noncoding RNA (ncRNAs) were significantly enriched in the KEGG pathways 'mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling' and 'nitrogen metabolism'. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the candidate circRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs confirmed the negative correlation between miRNAs and ceRNAs. And two circRNA overexpression vectors were constructed to further verify the ceRNA network correlations in longan early SE. Our study revealed the potential role of circRNAs in longan early SE, providing new insights into the intricate regulatory mechanism underlying plant SE. 
2	35313329	Liver performs number of critical physiological functions in human system. Intoxication of liver leads to accumulation of free radicals that eventually cause damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis and cancer. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) belongs to hepatotoxin is converted to a highly reactive free radical by cytochrome P450 enzymes that causes liver damage. Plant extracts derived quercetin has substantial role in hepatoprotection. This study highlights the possible mechanism by which quercetin plays significant role in hepatoprotection. HPLC analysis revealed the abundance of quercetin in the fruit extracts of Gynocardia odorata and Diospyros malabarica, were isolated, purified and subjected to liver function analysis on Wistar rats. Post quercetin treatment improved liver function parameters in the hepatotoxic Wistar rats by augmenting bilirubin content, SGOT and SGPT activity. Gene expression profile of quercetin treated rats revealed down regulation of HGF, TIMP1 and MMP2 expressed during CCl4 induction. In silico molecular mechanism prediction suggested that quercetin has a high affinity for cell signaling pathway proteins BCL-2, JAK2 and Cytochrome P450 Cyp2E1, which all play a significant role in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity. In silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation have shown that quercetin has a plausible affinity for major signaling proteins in liver. MMGBSA studies have revealed high binding of quercetin (ΔG) -41.48±11.02, -43.53±6.55 and -39.89±5.78 kcal/mol, with BCL-2, JAK2 and Cyp2E1, respectively which led to better stability of the quercetin bound protein complexes. Therefore, quercetin can act as potent inhibitor against CCl4 induced hepatic injury by regulating BCL-2, JAK2 and Cyp2E1. 
3	35313235	Hemophilia B (HB) is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by the genetic variation of the coagulation factor IX (FIX) gene (F9). Several F9 structural abnormalities, including large deletion and/or insertion, have been observed to cause HB development. However, there is limited information available on F9 deep intronic variations. In this study, we report about a novel large deletion/insertion observed in a deep region of F9 intron 1 that causes mRNA splicing abnormalities. The patient was a Japanese male diagnosed with moderate HB (FIX:C = 3.0 IU/dL). The genomic DNA of the patient was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes. DNA sequences of F9 exons and splice donor/acceptor sites were analyzed via polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Variant-affected F9 mRNA aberration and FIX protein production, secretion, and coagulant activity were analyzed by cell-based exon trap and splicing-competent FIX expression vector systems. A 28-bp deletion/476-bp insertion was identified in the F9 intron 1 of a patient with moderate HB. A DNA sequence identical to a part of the inverted HNRNPA1 exon 12 was inserted. Cell-based transcript analysis revealed that this large intronic deletion/insertion disrupted F9 mRNA splicing pattern, resulting in reduction of protein-coding F9 mRNA. A novel deep intronic F9 rearrangement was identified in a Japanese patient with moderate HB. Abnormal F9 mRNA splicing pattern due to this deep intronic structural variation resulted in a reduction of protein-coding F9 mRNA, which probably caused the moderate HB phenotype. 
4	35313230	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by altered social communication, restricted interests, and stereotypic behaviors. Although the molecular and cellular pathogeneses of ASD remain elusive, impaired neural stem cell differentiation and neuronal migration during cortical development are suggested to be critically involved in ASD. ANK2, which encodes for a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein involved in recruiting membrane proteins into specialized membrane domains, has been identified as a high-confidence ASD risk gene. However, the role of ANK2 in early neural development remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the role of ANK2 in the cerebral cortex of developing mouse using in utero electroporation. We provide evidence suggesting that ANK2 regulates neural stem cell differentiation and neuronal migration in the embryonic cerebral cortex, where Ank2 is highly expressed. We also demonstrated that Ank2 knockdown alters the expression of genes involved in neural development. Taken together, these results support the view that ANK2 haploinsufficiency in patients may impair neural development, resulting in an increased risk of ASD. Our study findings provide new insights into the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of ASD, given that among high-confidence ASD genes, ANK2 is rare in that it encodes for a scaffolding protein for the membrane protein complex required for neuronal functions. 
5	35313200	Social motivation and reward are dynamic and flexible, shifting adaptively across contexts to meet changing social demands. This is exceptionally apparent when seasonal contexts are considered in seasonally breeding songbirds as they cycle from periods of sexual motivation and reward during the breeding season to periods of extreme gregariousness outside the breeding season when non-sexual social interactions gain reward value, motivating birds to form flocks. Here we review evidence demonstrating a key integrative role for the medial preoptic area (mPOA) in the seasonally-appropriate adjustment of behaviors, with seasonal changes in dopamine activity in mPOA adjusting social motivation and changes in opioid activity modifying social reward. Experiments demonstrate that dramatic seasonal fluctuations in steroid hormone concentrations alter patterns of opioid- and dopamine-related protein and gene expression in mPOA to modify social motivation and reward to meet seasonal changes in social demands. These studies of birdsong and seasonality provide new insights into neural and endocrine mechanisms underlying adaptive changes in social motivation and reward and highlight an underappreciated, evolutionarily conserved role for the mPOA in important social behaviors in non-reproductive contexts. 
6	35313160	Cadmium (Cd) is a harmful element that affects plant growth and development. Genetic improvements could be applied for enhancing Cd tolerance and accumulation in plants. Here, a novel Cd stress-induced gene, NtNRAMP3, was identified in tobacco. We constructed two NtNRAMP3-knockout (KO) tobacco lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which enhanced Cd tolerance and Cd accumulation in tobacco leaves compared with those in the wildtype (WT). Subcellular localization analysis suggested that NtNRAMP3 is a tonoplast protein and GUS (β-glucuronidase) histochemical analysis showed that NtNRAMP3 is highly expressed in the conductive tissue of leaves. NtNRAMP3-KO tobacco showed reduced Cd translation from vacuole to cytosol in leaves compared with the WT, and its vacuolar Cd concentration was significantly higher (20.78-22.81%) than that in the WT; in contrast, Cd concentration in the cytosol was reduced by 13.72-20.15%, preventing chlorophyll degradation and reducing reactive oxygen species accumulation in the leaves. Our findings demonstrate that NtNRAMP3 is involved in regulating Cd subcellular distribution (controlling Cd transport from vacuoles to the cytosol) and affects Cd tolerance and its accumulation in tobacco. This provides a key candidate gene to improve the phytoremediation efficiency of plants via genetic engineering. 
7	35313079	Squamous and anaplastic thyroid cancers are the most aggressive and life-threatening cancer types in humans, with lymph node involvement in 59% of cases and distant metastases in 26% of cases of all thyroid cancers. The median survival of squamous thyroid cancer patients is less than eight months and therefore of high clinical concern. Here we show that both VEGFC and VEGFR2/KDR are overexpressed in thyroid cancers, indicating that VEGF/VEGFR signaling plays a carcinogenic role in thyroid cancer development. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we established a KDR knockout (KO) SW579 squamous thyroid cancer cell line that exhibited dramatically decreased colony formation and invasion abilities (30% and 60% reduction, respectively) when compared to scrambled control cells. To validate the potential of KDR as a therapeutic target for thyroid cancers, we used the KDR RTK inhibitor sunitinib. Protein analysis and live/dead assay were performed to demonstrate that sunitinib significantly inhibited cell growth signal transduction and induced cell apoptosis of SW579 cells. These results suggest that selective targeting of KDR may have potential for development into novel anti-cancer therapies to suppress VEGF/VEGFR-mediated cancer development in patients with clinical advanced thyroid cancer. 
8	35313031	Photomorphogenic remodelling of seedling growth is a key developmental transition in the plant life cycle. The α/β-hydrolase signalling protein KARRIKIN-INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2), a close homologue of the strigolactone receptor DWARF14 (D14), is involved in this process, but it is unclear how the effects of KAI2 on development are mediated. Here, using a combination of physiological, pharmacological, genetic and imaging approaches in Arabidopsis thaliana (Heynh.) we show that kai2 phenotypes arise because of a failure to downregulate auxin transport from the seedling shoot apex towards the root system, rather than a failure to respond to light per se. We demonstrate that KAI2 controls the light-induced remodelling of the PIN-mediated auxin transport system in seedlings, promoting a reduction in PIN7 abundance in older tissues, and an increase of PIN1/PIN2 abundance in the root meristem. We show that removing PIN3, PIN4 and PIN7 from kai2 mutants, or pharmacological inhibition of auxin transport and synthesis, is sufficient to suppress most kai2 seedling phenotypes. We conclude that KAI2 regulates seedling morphogenesis by its effects on the auxin transport system. We propose that KAI2 is not required for the light-mediated changes in PIN gene expression but is required for the appropriate changes in PIN protein abundance within cells. 
9	35313030	Resolution of pathways that converge to induce deleterious effects in hepatic diseases, such as in the later stages, has potential anti-fibrotic effects that may improve outcomes. To explore whether humans and rodents display similar fibrotic signaling networks, we assiduously mapped kinase pathways using 340 substrate targets, upstream bioinformatic analysis of kinase pathways, and over 2000 random sampling iterations using the PamGene PamStation kinome microarray chip technology. Using this technology, we characterized a large number of kinases with altered activity in liver fibrosis of both species. Gene expression and immunostaining analyses validate many of these kinases as bona fide signaling events. Surprisingly, the insulin receptor (INSR) emerged as a considerable protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) that is hyperactive in fibrotic liver disease in humans and rodents. Discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase (DDR), activated by collagen that increases during fibrosis, was another hyperactive PTK in humans and rodents with fibrosis. The serine/threonine kinases (STK) found to be the most active in fibrosis were DM1 protein kinase (DMPK) and members of the protein kinase (PK) family of kinases. We compared the fibrotic events over four models: humans with cirrhosis and three murine models with differing levels of fibrosis, including two models of fatty liver disease with emerging fibrosis. The data demonstrate a high concordance between human and rodent hepatic kinome signaling that focalizes, as shown by our network analysis of detrimental pathways. Our findings here establish the first comprehensive kinase atlas for liver fibrosis, which identifies analogous signaling events conserved among humans and rodents. 
10	35312909	Carbendazim (CBZ) is one of the most common fungicides used to fight plant fungal diseases, otherwise, it leaves residue on fruits, vegetables, and soil that contaminate the environment, water, animal, and human causing serious health problems. Several studies have reported the reproductive and endocrine pathological disorders induced by CBZ in several animal models, but little is known about its neurotoxicity. So that, the present study aimed to explain the possible mechanisms of CBZ induced neurotoxicity in rats. Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 15). Group (1) received normal saline and was kept as the negative control group, whereas groups (2, 3, 4) received CBZ at 100, 300, 600 mg/kg b.wt respectively. All rats received the aforementioned materials daily via oral gavage. Brain tissue samples were collected at 7, 14, 28 days from the beginning of the experiment. CBZ induced oxidative stress damage manifested by increasing MDA levels and reducing the levels of TAC, GSH, CAT in some brain areas at 14 and 28 days. There were extensive neuropathological alterations in the cerebrum, hippocampus, and cerebellum with strong caspase-3, iNOS, Cox-2 protein expressions mainly in rats receiving 600 mg/kg CBZ at each time point. Moreover, upregulation of mRNA levels of NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-1B genes and downregulation of the transcript levels of both AchE and MAO genes were recorded in all CBZ receiving groups at 14 and 28 days especially those receiving 600 mg/kg CBZ. Our results concluded that CBZ induced dose- and time-dependent neurotoxicity via disturbance of oxidant/antioxidant balance and activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. We recommend reducing the uses of CBZ in agricultural and veterinary fields or finding other novel formulations to reduce its toxicity on non-target organisms and enhance its efficacy on the target organisms. 
11	35312732	The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be fatal, and several variants of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) have increased avidity for human cell receptors. A single missense mutation of U to G at nucleotide position 1355 (U1355G) in the spike (S) gene changes leucine to arginine (L452R) in the spike protein. This mutation has been observed in the India and California strains (B.1.617 and B.1.427/B.1.429, respectively). Control of COVID-19 requires rapid and reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we established a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay plus a bioluminescent assay in real-time (BART) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and the L452R spike mutation. The specificity and sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was evaluated using synthetic RNAs including target sequences and RNA-spiked clinical nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens as well as reference strains representing five viral and four bacterial pathogens. The novel RT-LAMP-BART assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 was highly specific compared to the conventional real-time RT-PCR. Within 25 min, the RT-LAMP-BART assay detected 80 copies of the target gene in a sample, whereas the conventional real-time RT-PCR method detected 5 copies per reaction within 130 min. Using RNA-spiked specimens, the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP-BART assay was slightly attenuated compared to purified RNA as a template. The results were identical to those of the conventional real-time RT-PCR method. Furthermore, using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe, the RT-LAMP-BART method correctly identified the L452R spike mutation. This is the first report describes RT-LAMP-BART as a simple, inexpensive, rapid, and useful assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2, its variants of concern, and for screening of COVID-19. 
12	35312702	Cell-free transcription and translation systems promise to accelerate and simplify the engineering of proteins, biological circuits and metabolic pathways. Their encapsulation on microfluidic platforms can generate millions of cell-free reactions in picoliter volume droplets. However, current methods struggle to create DNA diversity between droplets while also reaching sufficient protein expression levels. In particular, efficient multi-gene expression has remained elusive. We here demonstrate that co-encapsulation of DNA-coated beads with a defined cell-free system allows high protein expression while also supporting genetic diversity between individual droplets. We optimize DNA loading on commercially available microbeads through direct binding as well as through the sequential coupling of up to three genes via a solid-phase Golden Gate assembly or BxB1 integrase-based recombineering. Encapsulation with an off-the-shelf microfluidics device allows for single or multiple protein expression from a single DNA-coated bead per 14 pL droplet. We envision that this approach will help to scale up and parallelize the rapid prototyping of more complex biological systems. 
13	35312700	"Sperm deliver the male complement of DNA to the ovum, and thus play a key role in sexual reproduction. Accordingly, spermatogenesis has outstanding significance in fields as disparate as infertility treatments and pest-control, making it a broadly interesting and important focus for molecular genetics research in a wide range of species. Here we investigate spermatogenesis in the model lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori (silkworm moth), with particular focus on the gene PMFBP1 (polyamine modulated factor 1 binding protein 1). In humans and mouse, PMFBP1 is essential for spermatogenesis, and mutations of this gene are associated with acephalic spermatozoa, which cause infertility. We identified a B. mori gene labeled as ""PMFBP1"" in GenBank's RefSeq database and sought to assess its role in spermatogenesis. Like in mammals, the silkworm version of this gene (BmPMFBP1) is specifically expressed in testes. We subsequently generated BmPMFBP1 mutants using a transgenic CRISPR/Cas9 system. Mutant males were sterile while the fertility of mutant females was comparable to wildtype females. In B. mori, spermatogenesis yields two types of sperm, the nucleated fertile eupyrene sperm, and anucleated unfertile apyrene sperm. Mutant males produced abnormal eupyrene sperm bundles but normal apyrene sperm bundles. For eupyrene sperm, nuclei were mislocated and disordered inside the bundles. We also found the BmPMFBP1 deficiency blocked the release of eupyrene sperm bundles from testes to ejaculatory seminalis. We found no obvious abnormalities in the production of apyrene sperm in mutant males, and double-matings with apyrene-deficient sex-lethal mutants rescued the ΔBmPMFBP1 infertility phenotype. These results indicate BmPMFBP1 functions only in eupyrene spermatogenesis, and highlight that distinct genes underlie the development of the two sperm morphs commonly found in Lepidoptera. Bioinformatic analyses suggest PMFBP1 may have evolved independently in lepidoptera and mammals, and that despite the shared name, are likely not homologous genes. "
14	35312693	The parasite Trypanosoma brucei grows as bloodstream forms in mammalian hosts, and as procyclic forms in tsetse flies. In trypanosomes, gene expression regulation depends heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms. Both the RNA-binding protein RBP10 and glycosomal phosphoglycerate kinase PGKC are expressed only in mammalian-infective forms. RBP10 targets procyclic-specific mRNAs for destruction, while PGKC is required for bloodstream-form glycolysis. Developmental regulation of both is essential: expression of either RBP10 or PGKC in procyclic forms inhibits their proliferation. We show that the 3'-untranslated region of the RBP10 mRNA is extraordinarily long-7.3kb-and were able to identify six different sequences, scattered across the untranslated region, which can independently cause bloodstream-form-specific expression. The 3'-untranslated region of the PGKC mRNA, although much shorter, still contains two different regions, of 125 and 153nt, that independently gave developmental regulation. No short consensus sequences were identified that were enriched either within these regulatory regions, or when compared with other mRNAs with similar regulation, suggesting that more than one regulatory RNA-binding protein is important for repression of mRNAs in procyclic forms. We also identified regions, including an AU repeat, that increased expression in bloodstream forms, or suppressed it in both forms. Trypanosome mRNAs that encode RNA-binding proteins often have extremely extended 3'-untranslated regions. We suggest that one function of this might be to act as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure correct regulation even if mRNA processing or expression of trans regulators is defective. 
15	35312629	Oocyte activation deficiency (OAD) remains the predominant cause of total/low fertilization rate in assisted reproductive technology (ART). Phospholipase C zeta (PLCζ) is the dominant sperm-specific factor responsible for triggering oocyte activation in mammals. OAD has been linked to numerous PLCζ abnormalities in patients experiencing failed in-vitro fertilization (IVF) or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles. While significant efforts have enhanced our understanding of the clinical relevance of PLCζ, and the potential effects of genetic variants upon functionality, our ability to apply PLCζ in a diagnostic or therapeutic role remains limited. Artificial oocyte activation (AOA) is the only option for patients experiencing OAD but lacks a reliable diagnostic approach. Immunofluorescence analysis has revealed that the levels and localization patterns of PLCζ within sperm can help us to indirectly diagnose a patient's ability to induce oocyte activation. Screening of the gene encoding PLCζ protein is also critical if we are to fully determine the extent by which genetic factors might play a role in the aberrant expression and/or localization patterns observed in infertile patients. Collectively, these findings highlight the clinical potential of PLCζ, both as a prognostic indicator of OAD, and eventually as a therapeutic agent. In this review, we focus on our understanding of the association between OAD and PLCζ by discussing the localization and expression of this key protein in human sperm, the potential genetic causes of OAD, and the diagnostic tools that are currently available to us to identify PLCζ deficiency and select patients that would benefit from targeted therapy. 
16	35312240	Hyperproteinemia is a metabolic disorder associated with increased plasma protein concentration (PPC) and is often clinically complicated by malignant diseases or severe infections. At present, however, research on the molecular mechanism underlying high PPC (HPPC) is scant. Here, an animal model of primary hyperproteinemia was constructed in an invertebrate ( Bombyx mori) to investigate the effects of HPPC on circulating blood cells. Results showed that HPPC affected blood cell homeostasis, leading to increased reactive oxygen species levels, and induced programmed cell death dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum-calcium ion signaling pathway. HPPC induced the proliferation of blood cells, mainly granulocytes, by activating the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. Supplementation with the endocrine hormone active substance 20E significantly reduced the impact of HPPC on blood cell homeostasis. Thus, we identified a novel signaling pathway by which HPPC affects blood cell homeostasis, which differs from hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypercholesterolemia. In addition, we showed that down-regulation of gene expression of the hematopoietic factor Gcm could be used as a potential early detection indicator for hyperproteinemia. 
17	35312233	Cuticle is not only critical for protecting insects from noxious stimuli but also involved in a variety of metabolic activities. Cuticular proteins (CPs) affect cuticle structure and mechanical properties during insect growth, reproduction, and environmental adaptation. Here we describe the identification and characterization of a member of the RR-1 subfamily of CPs with an R&R consensus (CPR) in Tribolium castaneum (TcCPR69). Although it was previously reported to be highly expressed in the wings, we found that knocking down TcCPR69 by RNA interference (RNAi) did not cause obvious wings abnormalities but markedly disrupted the growth and metamorphosis of beetles with 100% cumulative mortality; additionally, the chitin content of the pharate adult was decreased and the new abdominal cuticle was significantly thinner before molting. TcCPR69 showed chitin-binding ability and the expression levels of key genes involved in chitin metabolism (trehalase [TcTRE], chitin synthase [TcCHSA and TcCHSB], and chitinase [TcCHT5 and TcCHT10]) were also decreased by TcCPR69 knockdown. TcCPR69 gene expression peaked shortly after molting and was increased 2.61 fold at 12 h after 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) injection. This was reversed by RNAi of the ecdysone-related genes ecdysone receptor (TcECR) and fushi tarazu transcription factor 1 (TcFTZ-F1). These results indicate that TcCPR69 is positively regulated by 20E signaling to contribute to cuticle formation and maintain chitin accumulation during the growth and metamorphosis of beetle.

18	35312190	The key proteins involved in transcriptional regulation play convergent roles in cellular homeostasis, and their dysfunction mediates aberrant gene expressions that underline the hallmarks of tumorigenesis. As tumor progression is dependent on such abnormal regulation of transcription, it is important to discover novel chemical entities as antitumor drugs that target key tumor-associated proteins involved in transcriptional regulation. Despite most key proteins (especially transcription factors) involved in transcriptional regulation are historically recognized as undruggable targets, multiple targeting approaches at diverse levels of transcriptional regulation, such as epigenetic intervention, inhibition of DNA-binding of transcriptional factors, and inhibition of the protein-protein interactions (PPIs), have been established in preclinically or clinically studies. In addition, several new approaches have recently been described, such as targeting proteasomal degradation and eliciting synthetic lethality. This review will emphasize on accentuating these developing therapeutic approaches and provide a thorough conspectus of the drug development to target key proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and their impact on future oncotherapy. 
19	35312185	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common type of chronic liver disease in children. The mechanisms that drive NAFLD disease progression in this specific patient population remain poorly defined. In this study, we obtained liver biopsy samples from a multiethnic cohort of pediatric patients with NAFLD (n = 52, mean age = 13.6 years) and healthy liver controls (n = 5). We analyzed transcriptomic changes associated with NAFLD stages using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Unsupervised clustering as well as pairwise transcriptome comparison distinguished NAFLD from healthy livers. We identified perturbations in pathways including calcium and insulin/glucose signaling occurring early in NAFLD disease, before the presence of histopathologic evidence of advanced disease. Transcriptomic comparisons identified a 25-gene signature associated with the degree of liver fibrosis. We also identified expression of the insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) gene family (1/2/3/7) as correlating with disease stages, and it has the potential to be used as a peripheral biomarker in NAFLD. Comparing our data set with publicly available adult and adolescent transcriptomic data, we identified similarities and differences in pathway enrichment and gene-expression profiles between adult and pediatric patients with NAFLD. Regulation of genes including interleukin-32, IGFBP1, IGFBP2, and IGFBP7 was consistently found in both NAFLD populations, whereas IGFBP3 was specific to pediatric NAFLD. Conclusion: This paper expands our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying pediatric NAFLD. It identifies potential biomarkers and directs us toward new therapies in this population. 
20	35312165	The methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is commonly used for the production of recombinant proteins at scale. The identification of an optimally overexpressing strain following transformation can be time and reagent consuming. Fluorescent reporters like GFP have been used to assist identification of superior producers, but their relatively big size, maturation requirements and narrow temperature range restrict their applications. Here, we introduce the use of iLOV, a flavin-based fluorescent protein, as a fluorescent marker to identify P. pastoris high-yielding strains easily and rapidly. The use of this fluorescent protein as a fusion partner is exemplified by the production of the antimicrobial peptide NI01, a difficult target to overexpress in its native form. iLOV fluorescence correlated well with protein expression level and copy number of the chromosomally integrated gene. An easy and simple medium-throughput plate-based screen directly following transformation is demonstrated for low complexity screening, while a high-throughput method using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) allowed for comprehensive library screening. Both codon optimization of the iLOV_NI01 fusion cassettes and different integration strategies into the P. pastoris genome were tested to produce and isolate a high-yielding strain. Checking the genetic stability, process reproducibility and following the purification of the active native peptide are eased by visualization of and efficient cleavage from the iLOV reporter. We show that this system can be used for expression and screening of several different antimicrobial peptides recombinantly produced in P. pastoris. 
21	35312143	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with inflammation and various forms of chronic disease. The Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) gene has been implicated in mechanisms of inflammation and anxiety, and methylation at a particular locus in this gene (cg10636246) has previously been shown to influence the association between PTSD and elevated C-reactive protein levels in blood. We tested if this association might extend to other indicators of inflammation and to plasma-based measures of neuropathology in a cohort of post-9/11 US military veterans. Using a Bayesian approach, mediation models were tested cross-sectionally (n = 478) and longitudinally (n = 298). Peripheral markers of inflammation and neuropathology were measured with ultra-sensitive Single Molecule Array (Simoa®) technology. Analyses revealed indirect effects of PTSD symptom severity on peripheral indices of both inflammation (interleukin [IL]6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α; indirect standardized [std.] ß range = 0.018-0.023, all p-values adjusted for multiple testing [padj ] < 0.05) and neuropathology (neurofilament light [NFL]; indirect std. ß = -0.018, padj  = 0.02) via AIM2 methylation. This indirect effect was also evident when predicting IL-10 at a follow-up assessment (indirect std. ß = -0.018, padj  = 0.04) controlling for baseline IL-10. Given that AIM2 methylation mediated the association between PTSD symptoms and multiple inflammatory and neuropathology markers, our results suggest that AIM2 methylation may offer clinical utility for indexing risk for adverse health outcomes associated with these peripheral indices of inflammation and neuropathology. Results also suggest a possible shared etiology underlying the frequent co-occurrence of inflammation and neuropathology. 
22	35312097	The mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) is extensively used to better understand the phylogenetic relationships within the family level, but there are still limited representations at the tribe level of Anthocoridae. Here we describe the first complete mitogenome of Dufouriellini. The mitogenome of Cardiastethus sp. is 15,209 bp in size, containing 13 typical protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs, 2 ribosomal RNAs, and a control region. All genes are arranged in the same gene order as the most other known cimicomorphan mitogenomes. The phylogenetic relationships based on mitogenomes using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood methods show that Dufouriellini is sister to Anthocorini, and then both of them together form sister group with Oriini. The monophyly of each superfamily of Cimicomorpha is generally well supported. Reduvioidea is basal within Cimicomorpha. The topology of the remaining superfamily is as follows: (Miroidea + (Cimicoidea + (Velocipedoidea + Nabioidea))). This study will help to enhance our understanding of mitochondrial genomic evolution and phylogenetic relationships in the tribe level of Anthocoridae and also superfamily level of Cimicomorpha. 
23	35312071	Domain of Unknown Function 506 proteins are ubiquitous in plants. The phosphorus (P) stress-inducible REPRESSOR OF EXCESSIVE ROOT HAIR GROWTH1 (AtRXR1) gene encodes the first characterized DUF506. AtRXR1 inhibits root hair elongation by interacting with RabD2c GTPase. However, functions of other P-responsive DUF506 genes are still missing. Here, we selected two additional P-inducible DUF506 genes for further investigation. Expression of both genes was induced by auxin. Under P-stress, At3g07350 gene expressed ubiquitously in seedlings, whereas At1g62420 (AtRXR3) expression was strongest in roots. AtRXR3 over-expressors and knockouts had shorter and longer root hairs, respectively. A functional AtRXR3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion localized to root epidermal cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative reverse-transcriptase (qRT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), revealed that AtRXR3 was transcriptionally activated by RSL4. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and calmodulin (CaM)-binding assays showed that AtRXR3 interacted with CaM in presence of Ca2+ . Moreover, [Ca2+ ]cyt oscillations in root hairs of rxr3 mutants exhibited elevated frequencies and dampened amplitudes compared to those of wild type. Thus, AtRXR3 is another DUF506 protein that attenuates P-limitation induced root hair growth through mechanisms that involve RSL4 and interaction with CaM to modulate tip-focused [Ca2+ ]cyt oscillations.

24	35311829	As a vertebrate, the zebrafish has been widely used in biological studies. Zebrafish and humans share high genetic homology, which allows its use as a model for human diseases. Gene function study is based on the detection of gene expression patterns. Although immunohistochemistry offers a powerful way to assay protein expression, the limited number of commercially available antibodies in zebrafish restricts the application of costaining. In situ hybridization is widely used in zebrafish embryos to detect mRNA expression. This protocol describes how to obtain images by combining in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry for zebrafish embryo sections. In situ hybridization was performed prior to cryosectioning, followed by antibody staining. Immunohistochemistry and the imaging of a single cryosection were performed after in situ hybridization. The protocol is helpful to unravel the expression pattern of two genes, first by in situ transcript detection and then by immunohistochemistry against a protein in the same section. 
25	35311819	RNA interference has been a heavily utilized tool for reverse genetic analysis for two decades. In adult mosquitoes, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) administration has been accomplished primarily via injection, which requires significant time and is not suitable for field applications. To overcome these limitations, here we present a more efficient method for robust activation of RNAi by oral delivery of dsRNA to adult Anopheles gambiae. Long dsRNAs were produced in Escherichia coli strain HT115 (DE3), and a concentrated suspension of heat-killed dsRNA-containing bacteria in 10% sucrose was offered on cotton balls ad-libitum to adult mosquitoes. Cotton balls were replaced every 2 days for the duration of the treatment. Use of this method to target doublesex (a gene involved in sex differentiation) or fork head (which encodes a salivary gland transcription factor) resulted in reduced target gene expression and/or protein immunofluorescence signal, as measured by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) or fluorescence confocal microscopy, respectively. Defects in salivary gland morphology were also observed. This highly flexible, user-friendly, low-cost, time-efficient method of dsRNA delivery could be broadly applicable to target genes important for insect vector physiology and beyond. 
26	35311752	Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare genetic condition in which mutations in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) lead to decreased expression of this anchoring protein of the skin, causing the loss of stability at the dermo-epidermal junction. Most patients with RDEB experience neuropathic pain and itch due to the development of a small fibre neuropathy, characterised by decreased intraepidermal innervation and thermal hypoaesthesia. To understand the physiopathology of this neuropathy, we used a mouse model of RDEB (Col7a1flNeo/flNeo) and performed a detailed characterisation of the somatosensory system. Col7a1flNeo/flNeo mice showed a decrease in heat sensitivity, an increase in spontaneous scratching, and a significant decrease in intraepidermal nerve fibre density in the hindpaw; these changes were distal because there was no significant loss of unmyelinated or myelinated fibres in the nerve trunk. Of interest, we observed a decrease in axon diameter in both myelinated and unmyelinated fibres. This axonal damage was not associated with inflammation of the dorsal root ganglion or central projection targets at the time of assessment. These results suggest that in RDEB, there is a distal degeneration of axons produced by exclusive damage of small fibres in the epidermis, and in contrast with traumatic and acute neuropathies, it does not induce sustained neuroinflammation. Thus, this animal model emphasizes the importance of a healthy cutaneous environment for maintenance of epidermal innervation and faithfully replicates the pathology in humans, offering the opportunity to use this model in the development of treatments for pain for patients with RDEB. 
27	35311649	Intracellular protein gradients serve a variety of functions, such as the establishment of cell polarity or to provide positional information for gene expression in developing embryos. Given that cell size in a population can vary considerably, for the protein gradients to work properly they often have to be scaled to the size of the cell. Here we examine a model of protein gradient formation within a cell that relies on cytoplasmic diffusion and cortical transport of proteins toward a cell pole. We show that the shape of the protein gradient is determined solely by the cell geometry. Furthermore, we show that the length scale over which the protein concentration in the gradient varies is determined by the linear dimensions of the cell, independent of the diffusion constant or the transport speed. This gradient provides scale-invariant positional information within a cell, which can be used for assembly of intracellular structures whose size is scaled to the linear dimensions of the cell, such as the cytokinetic ring and actin cables in budding yeast cells. 
28	35311644	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease observed with aging that represents the most common form of dementia. To date, therapies targeting end-stage disease plaques, tangles, or inflammation have limited efficacy. Therefore, we set out to identify a potential earlier targetable phenotype. Utilizing a mouse model of AD and human fetal cells harboring mutant amyloid precursor protein, we show cell intrinsic neural precursor cell (NPC) dysfunction precedes widespread inflammation and amyloid plaque pathology, making it the earliest defect in the evolution of the disease. We demonstrate that reversing impaired NPC self-renewal via genetic reduction of USP16, a histone modifier and critical physiological antagonist of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 1, can prevent downstream cognitive defects and decrease astrogliosis in vivo. Reduction of USP16 led to decreased expression of senescence gene Cdkn2a and mitigated aberrant regulation of the BMP pathway, a previously unknown function of USP16. Thus, we reveal USP16 as a novel target in an AD model that can both ameliorate the NPC defect and rescue memory and learning through its regulation of both Cdkn2a and BMP signaling.' 
29	35311629	The purpose of this research was to explore the diagnostic/prognostic significance and prospective molecular mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Diagnostic/prognostic significance of MAP3Ks was screened in the GSE1450 data set and validated in the Guangxi cohort. Various bioinformatics tools were used to explore the biological functions of prognosis-related genes. Subsequently, molecular biology assays were used to verify the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of specific gene. MAP3K9 was observed to be differentially expressed in HCC and adjacent tissues with satisfactory diagnostic value. It was discovered in survival analysis that MAP3K13 and MAP3K15 were associated with overall survival (OS) of patients with HBV-related HCC in the GSE1450 data set and the Guangxi cohort. Nomograms were established based on prognosis-related genes and clinical factors for individualized risk assessment. The assays on HCC cells demonstrated that MAP3K13 regulated the death and proliferation of HCC cells by activating the JNK pathway and inducing the expression of apoptosis-related factors. In conclusion, our results suggested that MAP3K9 might serve as a diagnostic biomarker in HBV-related HCC and MAP3K13 and MAP3K15 might serve as useful prognostic biomarkers. Besides, cytological assays prompted that MAP3K13 might impact the prognosis of HCC by regulating the JNK pathway and inducing apoptosis. 
30	35311603	Immune checkpoint blocking based on the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown exciting results in various types of cancer. However, due to the off-target effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blocker, low tumor immunogenicity and tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, a significant proportion of patients do not benefit from this treatment. Here, we constructed a novel multifunctional metal complex Fe/PEI-Tn by the coordination of polyethyleneimine (PEI) with Fe3+ and the modification of bifunctional peptides Tn containing the cell penetrating peptide (TAT) and nuclear localization signal peptide (NLS), which was coated with hyaluronic acid (HA) to prolong the circulation time in vivo. Fe/PEI-Tn can condensate PD-L1 trap plasmid (pPD-L1 trap) and mediate PD-L1 trap protein expression in tumor tissues in situ, thus blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Besides, Fe/PEI-Tn metal complex itself can act as an immune adjuvant to activate macrophages, reverse the phenotype of pro-tumor M2-type macrophages, and promote anti-tumor immunity. Meanwhile, Fe/PEI-Tn treatment can induce damage in tumor cells and release tumor-specific antigens into tumor microenvironment, thus stimulating anti-tumor immune response. Studies showed that HA/Fe/PEI-Tn/pPD-L1 trap complexes could promote the immune activation of tumor tissues and effectively delay tumor growth. This strategy provides a new direction for tumor combination therapy based on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. 
31	35311583	Mutational changes in bacterial ribosomes often affect gene expression and consequently cellular fitness. Understanding how mutant ribosomes disrupt global gene expression is critical to determining key genetic factors that affect bacterial survival. Here, we describe gene expression and phenotypic changes presented in Escherichia coli cells carrying an uL22(K90D) mutant ribosomal protein, which displayed alterations during growth. Ribosome profiling analyses revealed reduced expression of operons involved in catabolism, indole production, and lysine-dependent acid resistance. In general, translation initiation of proximal genes in several of these affected operons was substantially reduced. These reductions in expression were accompanied by increases in the expression of acid-induced membrane proteins and chaperones, the glutamate-decarboxylase regulon, and the autoinducer-2 metabolic regulon. In agreement with these changes, uL22(K90D) mutant cells had higher glutamate decarboxylase activity, survived better in extremely acidic conditions, and generated more biofilm in static cultures compared to their parental strain. Our work demonstrates that a single mutation in a non-conserved residue of a ribosomal protein affects a substantial number of genes to alter pH resistance and the formation of biofilms. IMPORTANCE All newly synthesized proteins must pass through a channel in the ribosome named the exit tunnel before emerging into the cytoplasm, membrane, and other compartments. The structural characteristics of the tunnel could govern protein folding and gene expression in a species-specific manner but how the identity of tunnel elements influences gene expression is less well-understood. Our global transcriptomics and translatome profiling demonstrate that a single substitution in a non-conserved amino acid of the E. coli tunnel protein uL22 has a profound impact on catabolism, cellular signaling, and acid resistance systems. Consequently, cells bearing the uL22 mutant ribosomes had an increased ability to survive acidic conditions and form biofilms. This work reveals a previously unrecognized link between tunnel identity and bacterial stress adaptation involving pH response and biofilm formation. 
32	35311535	Unique DNA repair enzymes that provide self-resistance against therapeutically important, genotoxic natural products have been discovered in bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Among these, the DNA glycosylase AlkZ is essential for azinomycin B production and belongs to the HTH_42 superfamily of uncharacterized proteins. Despite their widespread existence in antibiotic producers and pathogens, the roles of these proteins in production of other natural products are unknown. Here, we determine the evolutionary relationship and genomic distribution of all HTH_42 proteins from Streptomyces and use a resistance-based genome mining approach to identify homologs associated with known and uncharacterized BGCs. We find that AlkZ-like (AZL) proteins constitute one distinct HTH_42 subfamily and are highly enriched in BGCs and variable in sequence, suggesting each has evolved to protect against a specific secondary metabolite. As a validation of the approach, we show that the AZL protein, HedH4, associated with biosynthesis of the alkylating agent hedamycin, excises hedamycin-DNA adducts with exquisite specificity and provides resistance to the natural product in cells. We also identify a second, phylogenetically and functionally distinct subfamily whose proteins are never associated with BGCs, are highly conserved with respect to sequence and genomic neighborhood, and repair DNA lesions not associated with a particular natural product. This work delineates two related families of DNA repair enzymes-one specific for complex alkyl-DNA lesions and involved in self-resistance to antimicrobials and the other likely involved in protection against an array of genotoxins-and provides a framework for targeted discovery of new genotoxic compounds with therapeutic potential. IMPORTANCE Bacteria are rich sources of secondary metabolites that include DNA-damaging genotoxins with antitumor/antibiotic properties. Although Streptomyces produce a diverse number of therapeutic genotoxins, efforts toward targeted discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) producing DNA-damaging agents is lacking. Moreover, work on toxin-resistance genes has lagged behind our understanding of those involved in natural product synthesis. Here, we identified over 70 uncharacterized BGCs producing potentially novel genotoxins through resistance-based genome mining using the azinomycin B-resistance DNA glycosylase AlkZ. We validate our analysis by characterizing the enzymatic activity and cellular resistance of one AlkZ ortholog in the BGC of hedamycin, a potent DNA alkylating agent. Moreover, we uncover a second, phylogenetically distinct family of proteins related to Escherichia coli YcaQ, a DNA glycosylase capable of unhooking interstrand DNA cross-links, which differs from the AlkZ-like family in sequence, genomic location, proximity to BGCs, and substrate specificity. This work defines two families of DNA glycosylase for specialized repair of complex genotoxic natural products and generalized repair of a broad range of alkyl-DNA adducts and provides a framework for targeted discovery of new compounds with therapeutic potential. 
33	35311527	Pine wilt disease is a major forest disease worldwide, including in China, where it has severely damaged pine forest ecosystems, and the pathogen is pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). The thaumatin-like protein-1 gene (Bx-tlp-1) is a key gene associated with B. xylophilus pathogenicity, which is also responsive to α-pinene. In this study, an examination of Pinus massoniana seedlings infected by B. xylophilus revealed that monoterpene (sesquiterpene) levels peaked on days 15 and 27 (days 18 and 27). Meanwhile, P. massoniana Pm-tlp expression levels were high on days 3, 12, and 27, which were consistent with the expression of key enzymes genes in the terpene biosynthesis pathway. The functional similarity of B. xylophilus Bx-TLP-1 and P. massoniana Pm-TLP suggests Bx-TLP-1 and Pm-TLP may have similar roles in P. massoniana. There was also no secondary accumulation of terpenes in P. massoniana seedlings during B. xylophilus treated with dsRNA targeting Bx-tlp-1 (dsTLP1) infections, reflecting the decreased pathogenicity of B. xylophilus and the delayed disease progression in pine trees. And the results of micro-CT showed that the degree of cavitation for the trees inoculated with Bx-TLP-1 (0.3811 mm3) was greater than that for the trees inoculated with dsTLP1 PWNs (0.1204 mm3) on day 15 after inoculation. Results from this study indicated that B. xylophilus Bx-tlp-1 gene may induce the upregulated expression of related genes encoding enzymes in the terpene synthesis pathway of P. massoniana, resulting in the accumulation of terpenes, which also provided an insight to investigate the B. xylophilus pathogenicity in the future. 
34	35311509	Butyrate is produced by chemical synthesis based on crude oil, produced by microbial fermentation, or extracted from animal fats (M. Dwidar, J.-Y. Park, R. J. Mitchell, and B.-I. Sang, The Scientific World Journal, 2012:471417, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1100/2012/471417). Butyrate production by anaerobic bacteria is highly favorable since waste or sustainable resources can be used as the substrates. For this purpose, the native hyper-butanol producer Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4(HMT) was used as a chassis strain due to its broad substrate spectrum. BLASTp analysis of the predicted proteome of C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4(HMT) resulted in the identification of gene products potentially involved in acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation. Their participation in ABE fermentation was either confirmed or disproven by the parallel production of acids or solvents and the respective transcript levels obtained by transcriptome analysis of this strain. The genes encoding phosphotransacetylase (pta) and butyraldehyde dehydrogenase (bld) were deleted to reduce acetate and alcohol formation. The genes located in the butyryl-CoA synthesis (bcs) operon encoding crotonase, butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase with electron-transferring protein subunits α and β, and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase were overexpressed to channel the flux further towards butyrate formation. Thereby, the native hyper-butanol producer C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4(HMT) was converted into the hyper-butyrate producer C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum ΔbldΔpta [pMTL83151_BCS_PbgaL]. The transcription pattern following deletion and overexpression was characterized by a second transcriptomic study, revealing partial compensation for the deletion. Furthermore, this strain was characterized in pH-controlled fermentations with either glucose or Excello, a substrate yielded from spruce biomass. Butyrate was the main product, with maximum butyrate concentrations of 11.7 g·L-1 and 14.3 g·L-1, respectively. Minimal amounts of by-products were detected. IMPORTANCE Platform chemicals such as butyrate are usually produced chemically from crude oil, resulting in the carry-over of harmful compounds. The selective production of butyrate using sustainable resources or waste without harmful by-products can be achieved by bacteria such as clostridia. The hyper-butanol producer Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum N1-4(HMT) was converted into a hyper-butyrate producer. Butyrate production with very small amounts of by-products was established with glucose and the sustainable lignocellulosic sugar substrate Excello extracted from spruce biomass by the biorefinery Borregaard (Sarpsborg, Norway). 
35	35311508	Over the last decade, the genomes of several Bifidobacterium strains have been sequenced, delivering valuable insights into their genetic makeup. However, bifidobacterial genomes have not yet been systematically mined for genes associated with stress response functions and their regulation. In this work, a list of 76 genes related to stress response in bifidobacteria was compiled from previous studies. The prevalence of the genes was evaluated among the genome sequences of 171 Bifidobacterium strains. Although genes of the protein quality control and DNA repair systems appeared to be highly conserved, genome-wide in silico screening for consensus sequences of putative regulators suggested that the regulation of these systems differs among phylogenetic groups. Homologs of multiple oxidative stress-associated genes are shared across species, albeit at low sequence similarity. Bee isolates were confirmed to harbor unique genetic features linked to oxygen tolerance. Moreover, most studied Bifidobacterium adolescentis and all Bifidobacterium angulatum strains lacked a set of reactive oxygen species-detoxifying enzymes, which might explain their high sensitivity to oxygen. Furthermore, the presence of some putative transcriptional regulators of stress responses was found to vary across species and strains, indicating that different regulation strategies of stress-associated gene transcription contribute to the diverse stress tolerance. The presented stress response gene profiles of Bifidobacterium strains provide a valuable knowledge base for guiding future studies by enabling hypothesis generation and the identification of key genes for further analyses. IMPORTANCE Bifidobacteria are Gram-positive bacteria that naturally inhabit diverse ecological niches, including the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. Strains of the genus Bifidobacterium are widely used as probiotics, since they have been associated with health benefits. In the course of their production and administration, probiotic bifidobacteria are exposed to several stressors that can challenge their survival. The stress tolerance of probiotic bifidobacteria is, therefore, an important selection criterion for their commercial application, since strains must maintain their viability to exert their beneficial health effects. As the ability to cope with stressors varies among Bifidobacterium strains, comprehensive understanding of the underlying stress physiology is required for enabling knowledge-driven strain selection and optimization of industrial-scale production processes. 
36	35311473	The Integrator was originally discovered as a specialized 3'-end processing endonuclease complex required for maturation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-dependent small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). Since its discovery, Integrator's spectrum of substrates was significantly expanded to include non-polyadenylated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), telomerase RNA (tertRNA), several Herpesvirus transcripts, and messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Recently emerging transcriptome-wide studies reveled an important role of the Integrator in protein-coding genes, where it contributes to gene expression regulation through promoter-proximal transcription attenuation. These new functional data are complemented by several structures of Integrator modules and higher-order complexes, providing mechanistic insights into Integrator-mediated processing events. In this work, we summarize recent progress in our understanding of the structure and function of the Integrator complex. 
37	35311472	Alternative splicing (AS) contributes to diversifying and regulating cellular responses to environmental conditions and developmental cues by differentially producing multiple mRNA and protein isoforms from a single gene. Previous studies on AS in pathogenic fungi focused on profiling AS isoforms under a limited number of conditions. We analysed AS profiles in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, a global threat to rice production, using high-quality transcriptome data representing its vegetative growth (mycelia) and multiple host infection stages. We identified 4,270 AS isoforms derived from 2,413 genes, including 499 genes presumably regulated by infection-specific AS. AS appears to increase during infection, with 32.7% of the AS isoforms being produced during infection but absent in mycelia. Analysis of the isoforms observed at each infection stage showed that 636 AS isoforms were more abundant than corresponding annotated mRNAs, especially after initial hyphal penetration into host cell. Many such dominant isoforms were predicted to encode regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and phospho-transferases. We also identified the genes encoding distinct proteins via AS and confirmed the translation of some isoforms via a proteomic analysis, suggesting potential AS-mediated neo-functionalization of some genes during infection. Comprehensive profiling of the pattern of genome-wide AS during multiple stages of rice-M. oryzae interaction established a foundational resource that will help investigate the role and regulation of AS during rice infection. 
38	35311471	Macroautophagy/autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic process to mediate the degradation of cell organelles and protein aggregates, which participates in a variety of cellular responses, including immune signal transduction. KDM4D functions as an important histone demethylase to regulate gene transcription by inhibiting histone H3K9 trimethylation. Whether autophagy epigenetically regulates the immune response via modulating the stability and activity of KDM4D remains largely unclear. Recently, we identified TRIM14 (tripartite motif-containing 14) as an epigenetic regulator, which recruits USP14 and BRCC3 to form a regulatory complex, and promotes an inflammation response through inhibiting OPTN-mediated autophagic degradation of KDM4D. 
39	35311281	5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) is a processing byproduct present in foods that are consumed daily by humans, and the diet is the principal route for human exposure to it. However, its adverse effects on gastric epithelial cells are not fully understood. Based on the half inhibitory concentration value, concentrations of HMF of 2, 4, 8, and 16 mM were selected for this study. After 5-HMF treatment for 24 h, the number of living cells decreased to 89.61 ± 0.48, 77.30 ± 0.57, 58.75 ± 0.36, and 19.61 ± 0.40% of the control, respectively. Apoptosis activated through both the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways was confirmed to be the primary mode of HMF-induced cell death. Further analysis revealed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in GES-1 cells increased 1.7-6.5 fold after exposure to 5-HMF. Moreover, the inhibition of ROS by N-acetylcysteine blocked HMF-induced apoptosis and cell proliferation suppression, indicating that oxidative stress was important in HMF-induced apoptosis. Besides, after 5-HMF treatment, the gene expressions of occludin and ZO-1 were reduced by 1.1-3.4 fold and 2.0-9.4 fold, respectively. The cell surface morphology and tight junction-related protein expression analysis also revealed the destructive effect of 5-HMF on tight junction integrity. Our research highlights a potential mechanism of HMF-induced toxicity in GES-1 cells and provides additional information on the health risks of 5-HMF exposure to the human gastric epithelium. 
40	35311172	Bananas, one of the most widely consumed fruits worldwide, are a rich source of valuable phytochemicals. In this study, the antioxidant and the anticancer potential of banana flesh was investigated. Of the four kinds of banana flesh extracts, the hexane extract (HE) had the highest total polyphenol content (2.54 ± 0.60 mg GAE/g) and total flavonoid content (1.69 ± 0.34 mg RE/g), followed by the chloroform fraction, total ethanol extract, and ethanol fraction. HE was found to exert a strong radical scavenging activity on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonicacid) (ABTS•) free radicals. According to the IC50 values in various cancer cell lines, HE was found to possess the greatest cell growth inhibitory potential in human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells and human triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. HE induced apoptosis in PANC-1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as evidenced by the appearance of condensation of chromatin, proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and 7, and increase in the level of the cleaved form of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of HE identified several anticancer compounds including palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, campesterol, stigmasterol, and γ-sitosterol, supporting the anticancer potential of HE. Our investigation provides a rationale for the use of banana flesh to minimize the risk of cancer-like diseases. 
41	35311150	N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as one of the most important modifications of RNA. Based on the expression of 23 different modes of m6A regulatory factors, we identified three different m6A modification patterns in bladder cancer. The effects of the three different modes of m6A modification on clinicopathological characteristics, immune cell infiltration levels and expression levels of immune checkpoint genes were comprehensively analyzed. In addition, the effects of different modes of m6A modification on the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy (atezolizumab) are also discussed. Our results confirm that m6A methylation plays an important role in immune cell recruitment in the tumor microenvironment of bladder cancer, which influences the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy for bladder cancer. We further confirmed the important role of FTO protein in the biological function of bladder cancer cells by performing in vitro experiments. FTO functions as an oncogene in bladder cancer cells, and upon FTO knockdown, the level of m6A enzyme activity in bladder cancer cells was significantly increased, apoptosis was increased, and cell proliferation and cell invasion were reduced. In addition, our study also confirmed that K216H and K216E are probably important targets for regulating FTO. We provide new insights into the regulatory pathways of the immune microenvironment and the methylation function of m6A in bladder cancer, which will help in designing novel diagnostic methods, prognostic tools, and therapeutic targets. 
42	35311121	The expression of Coiled-Coil Domain Containing 134(CCDC134) is up-regulated in different pan-cancer species. However, its prognostic value and correlation with immune infiltration in breast cancer are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the prognostic role of CCDC134 in breast cancer and its correlation with immune invasion. We downloaded the transcription profile of CCDC134 between breast cancer and normal tissues from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CCDC134 protein expression was assessed by the Clinical Proteomic Cancer Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and the Human Protein Atlas. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was also used for pathway analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to differentiate breast cancer from adjacent normal tissues. Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate the effect of CCDC134 on survival rate. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is built from STRING. Function expansion analysis is performed using the ClusterProfiler package. Through tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) and tumor Immune System Interaction database (TISIDB) to determine the relationship between CCDC134 expression level and immune infiltration. CTD database is used to predict drugs that inhibit CCDC134 and PubChem database is used to determine the molecular structure of identified drugs. The expression of CCDC134 in breast cancer tissues was significantly higher than that of CCDC134 mRNA expression in adjacent normal tissues. ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC value of CCDC134 was 0.663. Kaplan-meier survival analysis showed that patients with high CCDC134 had a lower prognosis (57.27 months vs 36.96 months, P = 2.0E-6). Correlation analysis showed that CCDC134 mRNA expression was associated with tumor purity immune invasion. In addition, CTD database analysis identified abrine, Benzo (A) Pyrene, bisphenol A, Soman, Sunitinib, Tetrachloroethylene, Valproic Acid as seven targeted therapy drugs that may be effective treatments for seven targeted therapeutics. It may be an effective treatment for inhibiting CCDC134. In breast cancer, upregulated CCDC134 is significantly associated with lower survival and immune infiltrates invasion. Our study suggests that CCDC134 can serve as a biomarker of poor prognosis and a potential immunotherapy target in breast cancer. Seven drugs with significant potential to inhibit CCDC134 were identified. 
43	35311114	Protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) is a type I PRMT that is involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression through methylating histone or non-histone proteins, and other processes such as alternative splicing, DNA repair, cell proliferation and senescence, and cell signaling. In addition, PRMT6 also plays different roles in various cancers via influencing cell growth, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and drug resistant, which make PRMT6 an anti-tumor therapeutic target for a variety of cancers. As a result, many PRMT6 inhibitors are being utilized to explore their efficacy as potential drugs for various cancers. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the function and structure of PRMT6. At the same time, we highlight the role of PRMT6 in different cancers, including the differentiation of its promotive or inhibitory effects and the underlying mechanisms. Apart from the above, current research progress and the potential mechanisms of PRMT6 behind them were also summarized. 
44	35311113	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a life-threatening and refractory malignancy with poor outcome. Genetic mutations are the hallmark of cancer. Thus far, there is no comprehensive prognostic model constructed by mutation-gene transcriptome in HCC. The prognostic value of mutation-gene signature in HCC remains elusive. RNA expression profiles and the corresponding clinical information were recruited from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was employed to establish gene signature. Kaplan-Meier curve and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve were implemented to evaluate the prognostic value. The Wilcoxon test was performed to analyze the expression of immune checkpoint genes, cell cycle genes, and tumor drug resistance genes in different risk groups. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-RCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to validate the mRNA and protein expression between HCC and adjacent nontumorous tissues in an independent cohort. A prognostic model consisting of five mutated genes was established by LASSO Cox regression analysis. The prognostic model classified patients into high- and low-risk groups. Compared with the low-risk group, patients in the high-risk group had significantly worse survival results. The prognostic model can accurately predict the overall survival of HCC patients and predict overall survival more accurately when combined with stage. Furthermore, the immune checkpoint genes, cell cycle genes, and tumor drug resistance genes were higher expressed in the high-risk group compared in the low-risk group. In addition, the expression level of prognostic signature genes was validated in an independent sample cohort, which was consistent with RNA sequencing expression in the TCGA database. The prediction model of HCC constructed using mutation-related genes is of great significance for clinical decision making and the personalized treatment of patients with HCC. 
45	35311097	Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation in various cancers, including lung cancer. However, its function and biological mechanism in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remain unclear. Data on HMMR expression from several public databases were extensively analyzed, including the prognosis of HMMR in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were analyzed using DAVID and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software. The correlation between HMMR expression and immune cell infiltration was analyzed in the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database, and the gene and protein networks were examined using the GeneMANIA and STRING databases. Experimentally, the expression of HMMR in LUAD and lung cancer cell lines was determined using immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR assays. Besides, the function of HMMR on cancer cell proliferation and migration was examined using cell growth curve and colony formation, Transwell, and wound healing assays. In this study, we found that HMMR was elevated in LUAD and that its high expression was associated with poor clinicopathological features and adverse outcomes in LUAD patients. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the expression of HMMR was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration and immune modulation. Interestingly, diverse immune cell infiltration affects the prognosis of LUAD. In the functional assay, depletion of HMMR significantly repressed the cancer cell growth and migration of LUAD. Mechanically, we found that that the DNA methylation/TMPO-AS1/let-7b-5p axis mediated the high expression of HMMR in LUAD. Depletion of TMPO-AS1 and overexpression of let-7b-5p could result in the decreased expression of HMMR in LUAD cells. Furthermore, we found that TMPO-AS1 was positively correlated with HMMR, yet negatively correlated with let-7b-5p expression in LUAD. Our findings elucidated that the DNA methylation/TMPO-AS1/let-7b-5p axis mediated the high expression of HMMR, which may be considered as a biomarker to predict prognosis in LUAD. 
46	35311096	To investigate the role of the miR-211-5p-GDNF signaling pathway in carboplatin resistance of retinoblastoma Y79 cells and what factors it may be affected by. A carboplatin-resistant retinoblastoma cell line (Y79R) was established in vitro. RNA-seq and microRNA-seq were constructed between Y79 and Y79R cells. RNA interference, RT-PCR, Western blot (WB), and flow cytometry were used to verify the expression of genes and proteins between the two cell lines. The TargetScan database was used to predict the microRNAs that regulate the target genes. STING sites and Co-Immunoprecipitation (COIP) were used to study protein-protein interactions. GDNF was speculated to be the top changed gene in the drug resistance in Y79R cell lines. Moreover, the speculation was verified by subsequent RT-PCR and WB results. When the expression of GDNF was knocked down, the IC50 of the Y79R cell line significantly reduced. GDNF was found to be the target gene of miR-211-5p. Downregulation of miR-211-5p promotes carboplatin resistance in human retinoblastoma Y79 cells. MiR-211-5p can regulate the expression of GDNF. Our further research also found that GDNF can bind to LIF which is also a secreted protein. Our results suggest that downregulation of miR-211-5p promotes carboplatin resistance in human retinoblastoma Y79 cells, and this process can be affected by GDNF-LIF interaction. These results can provide evidence for the reversal of drug resistance of RB. 
47	35311093	Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most diagnosed subtype of lung cancer; ferroptosis is widely involved in the pathological cell death associated with various cancers, including lung cancer. However, the comprehensive relationship between ferroptosis and LUAD is little known in molecular levels until now. In the present study, 513 LUAD patients could be aggregated into three clusters by consensus clustering based on RNA sequencing data of 291 ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database; cluster2 had significant survival advantage compared to the other two clusters. A novel prognostic model of 8 differential FRGs was constructed to effectively divide LUAD patients into high- or low-risk group according to the risk scores by the Cox and LASSO regression analyses. The overall survival of LUAD patients in the high-risk group was significantly worse in the TCGA and GEO cohorts. Moreover, patients with radiation therapy or high clinical stage had obviously higher risk scores. We validated the differential mRNA and protein expression of four FRGs in paired tumor and normal samples from our clinical cohort. Our study constructed a novel FRG signature to predict the prognosis of LUAD patients, which might provide a new prognostic tool and potential therapeutic targets for LUAD. 
48	35311082	Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by germline pathogenic variants in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes like MSH2. EPCAM deletions cause a minority (3%) of LS cases. However, there are only a few reports of LS-associated endometrial cancer (LS-EC) induced by the inactivation of the MSH2 gene due to EPCAM deletions. We present the case of a 45-years old woman diagnosed with endometrial cancer (EC). Definitive surgery revealed meso-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, stage IA without lymph-vascular space invasion. Four months later, she received radiation therapy (125I radioactive seeds implantation), and platinum-containing regimen combined chemotherapy because of vaginal stump metastasis of EC. After five years, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on pelvic mass because of presacral metastatic lymph node. IHC showed the absence of MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression in the pelvic mass tissue. Peripheral blood was used for genetic testing based on her cancer diagnosis and family history of cancer in close relatives. Genetic testing revealed deletions of exon 8 and 9 in EPCAM and deletions of exon 1 and 8 in MSH2; thus, we diagnosed the presence of LS. The patient underwent interstitial brachytherapy (BT) of the presacral metastatic lymph node. This case highlights that patients with LS-EC who are carriers of combined EPCAM-MSH2 deletion might experience better oncologic outcomes even with early recurrence. 
49	35310927	Despite many advances in diagnosis and therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy), cancer remains one of the most important public health problems worldwide. Every day, the role of exosomes in cancer development and metastasis is being better described. Liquid biopsy was developed for early detection of cancer through minimally invasive and serial examinations of body fluids, with the advantage of tracking tumor progression in real time. Exosomes are extracellular membrane vesicles with a diameter of 30-100 nm, which are secreted by various types of cells and are present in most biological fluids. For a long time, they were considered non-functional cellular components, and today it has already been proven that they are a means of intercellular information exchange. They can move bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA. Several studies have shown that their contents, including proteins and noncoding nucleic acids, may be of particular interest as biomarkers of diseases. The vast majority of gene transcripts are actually characterized as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and are clusters of RNAs that do not encode functional proteins. They can be small, about 20 nucleotides in length, and are known as microRNAs (miRNAs), or transcripts over 200 nucleotides in length, defined as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are a large group of ncRNAs over 200 nucleotides in length. LncRNAs, as regulatory factors, play an important role in complex cellular processes such as apoptosis, growth, differentiation, proliferation, etc. Recently, the results of many studies have also shown their essential role in carcinogenesis. Endogenous lncRNAs can be secreted by tumor cells into human biological fluids in the form of microvesicles, exosomes, or protein complexes, thereby forming circulating lncRNAs that are not degraded by RNA and are in a stable state. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been observed in cancer patients. In this context, endogenous lncRNAs can regulate the basic characteristics of cancer cells by controlling the expression of oncogenes associated with their suppressive and oncogenic functions. Therefore, circulating lncRNAs can be excellent biomarkers in cancer as well. This paper provides an overview of current research on the functional role of lncRNAs in cancer and their potential clinical applications as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer. 
50	35310909	The rate of ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the highest in women's reproductive systems. An improperly expressed microRNA (miRNA) has been discovered to have a vital role in the pathophysiology of OC. However, more research into OC's miRNA-message RNA (mRNA) gene interaction network is required. Firstly, the microarray data sets GSE25405 and GSE119055 from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database were downloaded and then analyzed with the GEO2R tool aiming at identifying DEMs (differential expressed miRNAs) between ovarian malignant tissue and ovarian normal tissue. The whole consistently changed miRNAs were then screened out to be candidate DEMs. For estimating underlying upstream transcription factors, FunRich was employed. miRNet was utilized to determine putative DEMs' downstream target genes. The R program was then used to do the GO annotation as well as the analysis of KEGG pathway enrichment for target genes. The PPI (protein-protein interaction), as well as the DEM-hub gene networks, were created by the Cytoscape software and STRING database. Finally, we chose the GSE74448 dataset to test the precision of hub gene expressions. We have screened out six (five upregulated and one downregulated) DEMs. The majority of upregulated and downregulated DEMs are likely regulated by SP1 (specificity protein 1). SP4 (s protein 4), POU2F1 (POU class 2 homeobox 1), MEF2A (myocyte-specific enhancer factor 2A), ARID3A (AT-rich interaction domain 3A), and EGR1 (early growth response 1) can regulate upregulated and downregulated DEMs. We have found 807 target genes (656 upregulated and 151 downregulated DEM), being generally enriched in focal adhesion and proteoglycans in cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as breast cancer. The majority of hub genes are projected to be controlled by hsa-miR-429, hsa-miR-140-5p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, and hsa-miR-199a-3p after the DEM-hub gene network was built. VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), EZH2 (enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit), and HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha) expressions are consistent with the GSE74448 dataset in the first 18 hub genes. We have built an underlying miRNA-mRNA interacting network in OC, giving us unparalleled insight into the disease's diagnosis and treatment. 
51	35310885	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease associated with age. Early diagnosis of PD is key to preventing the loss of dopamine neurons. Peripheral-blood biomarkers have shown their value in recent years because of their easy access and long-term monitoring advantages. However, few peripheral-blood biomarkers have proven useful. This study aims to explore potential peripheral-blood biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PD. Three substantia nigra (SN) transcriptome datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were divided into a training cohort and a test cohort. We constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) network, found their overlapping differentially expressed genes and studied them as the key genes. Analysis of the peripheral-blood transcriptome datasets of PD patients from GEO showed that three key genes were upregulated in PD over healthy participants. Analysis of the relationship between their expression and survival and analysis of their brain expression suggested that these key genes could become biomarkers. Then, animal models were studied to validate the expression of the key genes, and only SSR1 (the signal sequence receptor subunit1) was significantly upregulated in both animal models in peripheral blood. Correlation analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the correlation between brain dopaminergic neurons and SSR1 expression, and it was found that SSR1 expression was negatively correlated with dopaminergic neuron survival. The upregulation of SSR1 expression in peripheral blood was also found to precede the abnormal behavior of animals. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence technology further showed the value of SSR1 in clinical PD prediction. The three classifiers all showed that SSR1 had high predictability for PD. The classifier with the best prediction accuracy was selected through AUC and MCC to construct a prediction model. In short, this research not only provides potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PD but also establishes a possible artificial intelligence model for predicting PD. 
52	35310884	Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent seizures that originate in the temporal lobes of the brain. Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are the standard treatment for managing seizures in mTLE patients, but are frequently ineffective. Resective surgery is an option for some patients, but does not guarantee a postoperative seizure-free period. Therefore, further insight is needed into the pathogenesis of mTLE to enable the design of new therapeutic strategies. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified as important regulators of neuronal function and have been implicated in epilepsy. However, the mechanisms through which circRNAs contribute to epileptogenesis remain unknown. Here, we determine the circRNA transcriptome of the hippocampus and cortex of mTLE patients by using RNA-seq. We report 333 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs between healthy individuals and mTLE patients, of which 23 circRNAs displayed significant adjusted p-values following multiple testing correction. Interestingly, hippocampal expression of circ_Satb1, a circRNA derived from special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1), is decreased in both mTLE patients and in experimental epilepsy. Our work shows that circ_Satb1 displays dynamic patterns of neuronal expression in vitro and in vivo. Further, circ_Satb1-specific knockdown using CRISPR/CasRx approaches in hippocampal cultures leads to defects in dendritic spine morphology, a cellular hallmark of mTLE. Overall, our results identify a novel epilepsy-associated circRNA with disease-specific expression and previously unidentified cellular effects that are relevant for epileptogenesis. 
53	35310830	Spinocerebellar ataxias consist of a highly heterogeneous group of inherited movement disorders clinically characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia variably associated with additional distinctive clinical signs. The genetic heterogeneity is evidenced by the myriad of associated genes and underlying genetic defects identified. In this study, we describe a new spinocerebellar ataxia subtype in nine members of a Spanish five-generation family from Menorca with affected individuals variably presenting with ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, polyneuropathy, pyramidal signs, cerebellar atrophy and distinctive cerebral demyelination. Affected individuals presented with horizontal and vertical gaze-evoked nystagmus and hyperreflexia as initial clinical signs, and a variable age of onset ranging from 12 to 60 years. Neurophysiological studies showed moderate axonal sensory polyneuropathy with altered sympathetic skin response predominantly in the lower limbs. We identified the c.1877C > T (p.Ser626Leu) pathogenic variant within the SAMD9L gene as the disease causative genetic defect with a significant log-odds score (Z max = 3.43; θ = 0.00; P < 3.53 × 10-5). We demonstrate the mitochondrial location of human SAMD9L protein, and its decreased levels in patients' fibroblasts in addition to mitochondrial perturbations. Furthermore, mutant SAMD9L in zebrafish impaired mobility and vestibular/sensory functions. This study describes a novel spinocerebellar ataxia subtype caused by SAMD9L mutation, SCA49, which triggers mitochondrial alterations pointing to a role of SAMD9L in neurological motor and sensory functions. 
54	35310670	Plants balance water availability with gas exchange and photosynthesis by controlling stomatal aperture. This control is regulated in part by the circadian clock, but it remains unclear how signalling pathways of daily rhythms are integrated into stress responses. The serine/threonine protein kinase OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1) contributes to the regulation of stomatal closure via activation of S-type anion channels. OST1 also mediates gene regulation in response to ABA/drought stress. We show that ZEITLUPE (ZTL), a blue light photoreceptor and clock component, also regulates ABA-induced stomatal closure in Arabidopsis thaliana, establishing a link between clock and ABA-signalling pathways. ZTL sustains expression of OST1 and ABA-signalling genes. Stomatal closure in response to ABA is reduced in ztl mutants, which maintain wider stomatal apertures and show higher rates of gas exchange and water loss than wild-type plants. Detached rosette leaf assays revealed a stronger water loss phenotype in ztl-3, ost1-3 double mutants, indicating that ZTL and OST1 contributed synergistically to the control of stomatal aperture. Experimental studies of Populus sp., revealed that ZTL regulated the circadian clock and stomata, indicating ZTL function was similar in these trees and Arabidopsis. PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 5 (PRR5), a known target of ZTL, affects ABA-induced responses, including stomatal regulation. Like ZTL, PRR5 interacted physically with OST1 and contributed to the integration of ABA responses with circadian clock signalling. This suggests a novel mechanism whereby the PRR proteins-which are expressed from dawn to dusk-interact with OST1 to mediate ABA-dependent plant responses to reduce water loss in time of stress. 
55	35310642	Fraxinus velutina Torr with high salt tolerance has been widely grown in saline lands in the Yellow River Delta, China. However, the salt-tolerant mechanisms of F. velutina remain largely elusive. Here, we identified two contrasting cutting clones of F. velutina, R7 (salt-tolerant), and S4 (salt-sensitive) by measuring chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics (Fv/Fm ratio) in the excised leaves and physiological indexes in roots or leaves under salt treatment. To further explore the salt resistance mechanisms, we compared the transcriptomes of R7 and S4 from leaf and root tissues exposed to salt stress. The results showed that when the excised leaves of S4 and R7 were, respectively, exposed to 250 mM NaCl for 48 h, Fv/Fm ratio decreased significantly in S4 compared with R7, confirming that R7 is more tolerant to salt stress. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that salt stress induced the significant upregulation of stress-responsive genes in R7, making important contributions to the high salt tolerance. Specifically, in the R7 leaves, salt stress markedly upregulated key genes involved in plant hormone signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways; in the R7 roots, salt stress induced the upregulation of main genes involved in proline biosynthesis and starch and sucrose metabolism. In addition, 12 genes encoding antioxidant enzyme peroxidase were all significantly upregulated in both leaves and roots. Collectively, our findings revealed the crucial defense pathways underlying high salt tolerance of R7 through significant upregulation of some key genes involving metabolism and hub signaling pathways, thus providing novel insights into salt-tolerant F. velutina breeding. 
56	35310482	The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of protein 4.1G is able to specifically bind a 26-residue intrinsically disordered region of NuMA, forming a dynamic fuzzy complex. As one of a few cases of extremely fuzzy interactions between two intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) without induced folding, the principle of the binding is unknown. Here, we combined experimental and computational methods to explore the detailed mechanism of the interaction between 4.1G-CTD and NuMA. MD simulations suggest that the kinetic hub states in the structure ensemble of 4.1G-CTD are favorable in the fuzzy complex. The feature of these hub states is that the binding 'hot spot' motifs βA and βB exhibit β strand propensities and are well packed to each other. The binding between 4.1G-CTD and NuMA is disrupted at low pH, which changes the intramolecular packing of 4.1G-CTD and weakens the packing between βA and βB motifs. Low pH conditions also lead to increased hydrodynamic radius and acceleration of backbone dynamics of 4.1G-CTD. All these results underscore the importance of tertiary structural arrangements and overall compactness of 4.1G-CTD in its binding to NuMA, i.e. the compact disordered state of 4.1G-CTD is crucial for binding. Different from the short linear motifs (SLiMs) that are often found to mediate IDP interactions, 4.1G-CTD functions as an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD), which is a functional and structural unit similar to conventional protein domains. This work sheds light on the molecular recognition mechanism of IDPs/IDRs and expands the conventional structure-function paradigm in protein biochemistry. 
57	35310387	The effective osteointegration of orthopedic implants is a key factor for the success of orthopedic surgery. However, local metabolic imbalance around implants under osteoporosis condition could jeopardize the fixation effect. Inspired by the bone structure and the composition around implants under osteoporosis condition, alendronate (A) was grafted onto methacryloyl hyaluronic acid (H) by activating the carboxyl group of methacryloyl hyaluronic acid to be bonded to inorganic calcium phosphate on trabecular bone, which is then integrated with aminated bioactive glass (AB) modified by oxidized dextran (O) for further adhesion to organic collagen on the trabecular bone. The hybrid hydrogel could be solidified on cancellous bone in situ under UV irradiation and exhibits dual adhesion to organic collagen and inorganic apatite, promoting osteointegration of orthopedic implants, resulting in firm stabilization of the implants in cancellous bone areas. In vitro, the hydrogel was evidenced to promote osteogenic differentiation of embryonic mouse osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1) as well as inhibit the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of macrophages, leading to the upregulation of osteogenic-related gene and protein expression. In a rat osteoporosis model, the bone-implant contact (BIC) of the hybrid hydrogel group increased by 2.77, which is directly linked to improved mechanical stability of the orthopedic implants. Overall, this organic-inorganic, dual-adhesive hydrogel could be a promising candidate for enhancing the stability of orthopedic implants under osteoporotic conditions. 
58	35310092	Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is the most prevalent autosomic recessive ataxia and is associated with a severe cardiac hypertrophy and less frequently diabetes. It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding frataxin (FXN), a small mitochondrial protein. The primary consequence is a defective expression of FXN, with basal protein levels decreased by 70-98%, which foremost affects the cerebellum, dorsal root ganglia, heart and liver. FXN is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism but its exact function has remained elusive and highly debated since its discovery. At the cellular level, FRDA is characterized by a general deficit in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters and heme, iron accumulation and deposition in mitochondria, and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Based on these phenotypes and the proposed ability of FXN to bind iron, a role as an iron storage protein providing iron for Fe-S cluster and heme biosynthesis was initially proposed. However, this model was challenged by several other studies and it is now widely accepted that FXN functions primarily in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, with iron accumulation, heme deficiency and oxidative stress sensitivity appearing later on as secondary defects. Nonetheless, the biochemical function of FXN in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis is still debated. Several roles have been proposed for FXN: iron chaperone, gate-keeper of detrimental Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, sulfide production stimulator and sulfur transfer accelerator. A picture is now emerging which points toward a unique function of FXN as an accelerator of a key step of sulfur transfer between two components of the Fe-S cluster biosynthetic complex. These findings should foster the development of new strategies for the treatment of FRDA. We will review here the latest discoveries on the biochemical function of frataxin and the implication for a potential therapeutic treatment of FRDA. 
59	35310075	Quantifying differences in the amount of protein and mRNA caused by missense mutations in a gene of interest can be challenging, especially when using patient-derived primary cells, which are intrinsically variable. In this protocol, we describe how to culture patient-derived lymphoblast and fibroblast cell lines for later mRNA and protein quantification. We also describe the steps to examine variants of PUM1 in HEK293T cells, but the protocol can be applied to other proteins of interest. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Gennarino et al. (2018). 
60	35310043	To investigate changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression in human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cells in response to mechanical fluid flow stimulation. HTM cells were grown on a glass plate coated with 0.02% type I collagen (COL) and exposed to shear stress (0, 0.2, 1.0 dyne/cm2) for 12h. Changes in genes related to the ECM were evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Phosphorylation of Smad2 protein was investigated by Western blotting. After mechanical stimulation, COL type 4 alpha 2, COL type 6 alpha 1, and fibronectin-1 mRNA were significantly higher than the static control (P<0.05, <0.05, and <0.01, respectively). The metalloproteinase-2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA were significantly higher than the static control (P<0.05 and <0.01, respectively), while the differences in the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-2 mRNA were not significant. The phosphorylation of Smad2 levels was significantly higher compared to the static control cells. Changes in the expressions of genes associated ECM metabolism result in HTM cells after mechanical stimulation. The mechanical stimulation of the aqueous humor to the trabecular meshwork may promote ECM turnover and contribute to intraocular pressure homeostasis. 
61	35310026	In recent years, many traditional Chinese medicine injections based on Panax notoginseng saponin (PNS) have been reported to cause anaphylaxis. Previous studies on the anaphylactic saponins of PNS and their mechanism are inadequate. In this study, potential anaphylactic saponins were obtained by the separation of PNS and preparation of each individual component through comprehensive techniques, such as liquid chromatography, preparative chromatography, HPLC, NMR, and MS. The anaphylactic abilities of these saponins were tested using RBL-2H3 cells via a β-hexosaminidase release rate test. The results for the mechanism of anaphylaxis were obtained by a proteomic analysis using RBL-2H3 cells. The results indicate that, among all the saponins prepared, gypenoside LXXV and notoginsenoside T5 showed strong anaphylactic abilities and notoginsenoside ST-4 and ginsenoside Rk3 showed weak anaphylactic abilities. These 4 saponins can induce anaphylaxis via direct stimulation of effector cells. The gene oncology enrichment analysis results showed that, among these saponins, only gypenoside LXXV was related to organelles of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus and biological processes in response to organic cyclic compounds. Four proteins in RBL-2H3 cells with the accession numbers A0A0G2JWQ0, D3ZL85, D4A5G8, and Q8K3F0 were identified as crucial proteins in the anaphylactic process. This research will help traditional Chinese medicine injection manufacturers strengthen their quality control and ensure the safety of anaphylactic saponins. 
62	35310024	Endometrial injury is a common female disease. This study was designed to illustrate the effects of oxycodone on mifepristone-induced human endometrial stromal cells (hEndoSCs) injury and delineate the underlying molecular mechanism. hEndoSCs were stimulated with mifepristone to generate the endometrial injury in vitro model. hEndoSCs viability, cytotoxicity, and apoptosis were measured by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH), and flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, respectively. Meanwhile, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot assay were conducted to evaluate gene and protein expressions. The secretions of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The data revealed that mifepristone exposure memorably inhibited hEndoSCs viability and promoted cell apoptosis and inflammatory cytokines secretion, and oxycodone had no cytotoxicity on hEndoSCs. Oxycodone increased hEndoSCs growth, blocked cell apoptosis, enhanced Bcl-2 expression, reduced Bax levels, and decreased the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in mifepristone-induced hEndoSCs, exhibiting the protective effects in endometrial injury. In addition, the TLR4/NF-κB pathway-related protein levels (TLR4 and p-p65) in mifepristone-treated hEndoSCs were enhanced, while these enhancements were inhibited by oxycodone treatment. In conclusion, oxycodone exhibited the protective role in mifepristone-triggered endometrial injury via inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway. 
63	35309990	In 2019, the novel highly infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak rapidly led to a global pandemic with more than 346 million confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in 5.5 million associated deaths (January 2022). Entry of all SARS-CoV-2 variants is mediated by the cellular angisin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The virus abundantly replicates in the epithelia of the upper respiratory tract. Beyond vaccines for immunization, there is an imminent need for novel treatment options in COVID-19 patients. So far, only a few drugs have found their way into the clinics, often with modest success. Specific gene silencing based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) has emerged as a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention, preventing/limiting SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells or interfering with viral replication. Here, we pursued both strategies. We designed and screened nine siRNAs (siA1-9) targeting the viral entry receptor ACE2. SiA1, (siRNA against exon1 of ACE2 mRNA) was most efficient, with up to 90% knockdown of the ACE2 mRNA and protein for at least six days. In vitro, siA1 application was found to protect Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells from infection with SARS-CoV-2 with an up to ∼92% reduction of the viral burden indicating that the treatment targets both the endosomal and the viral entry at the cytoplasmic membrane. Since the RNA-encoded genome makes SARS-CoV-2 vulnerable to RNA interference (RNAi), we designed and analysed eight siRNAs (siV1-8) directly targeting the Orf1a/b region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, encoding for non-structural proteins (nsp). As a significant hallmark of this study, we identified siV1 (siRNA against leader protein of SARS-CoV-2), which targets the nsp1-encoding sequence (a.k.a. 'host shutoff factor') as particularly efficient. SiV1 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 or Huh-7 cells by more than 99% or 97%, respectively. It neither led to toxic effects nor induced type I or III interferon production. Of note, sequence analyses revealed the target sequence of siV1 to be highly conserved in SARS-CoV-2 variants. Thus, our results identify the direct targeting of the viral RNA genome (ORF1a/b) by siRNAs as highly efficient and introduce siV1 as a particularly promising drug candidate for therapeutic intervention. 
64	35309948	Background: Ferroptosis is a new form of cell death recently discovered that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy. This article is expected to provide a new direction for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in the future by screening potential drug targets associated with ferroptosis. Methods: Differential expression analysis of GSE5406 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was performed using the GEO2R tool. Functional annotation of ferroptosis related genes was also performed. Then we constructed protein-protein interaction networks and identified hub genes using Cytoscape. The candidates for pharmacological compounds targeting the hub genes were screened by cMap. Results: Totally 15 ferroptosis related genes (4 upregulated and 11 downregulated) for ischemic cardiomyopathy and 17 ferroptosis related genes (13 upregulated and 4 downregulated) for idiopathic cardiomyopathy were found. The biological processes involved in these genes mainly include negative regulation of apoptotic process, flavonoid metabolic process, response to drug for ischemic cardiomyopathy and cellular response to fibroblast growth factor stimulus, negative regulation of apoptotic process, and response to drug for idiopathic cardiomyopathy. KEGG results showed that these genes were mainly involved in MAPK signaling pathway for ischemic cardiomyopathy and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway for idiopathic cardiomyopathy. We generated a co-expression network for hub genes and obtained top 10 medications suggested respectively for ischemic/idiopathic cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: Our study reveals the potential role of ferroptosis related genes in ischemic and idiopathic cardiomyopathy through bioinformatics analysis. The hub genes and potential drugs may become novel biomarkers for prognosis and precision treatment in the future. 
65	35309935	Background: EFNA1-5 have important physiological functions in regulating tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, correlating EFNA genes in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer remains to be determined. Methods: Using public databases, the expression of EFNA1-5 in pan-cancer and gastric cancer was comprehensively analyzed using UCSC Xena, the Oncomine dataset and UALCAN. We further completed survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier plotter to evaluate the prognosis of the high and low expression groups of the EFNAs gene in patients with gastric cancer. The TIMER tool was used to reveal the correlation between immune cell infiltration and genes of interest. Spearman correlation was used to find an association between the EFNA genes and tumor stem cells, TIME, microsatellite instability (MSI) or tumor mutational burden (TMB). We also used cBioportal, GeneMANIA and STRINGS to explore the types of changes in these genes and the protein interactions. Finally, we described the TIME based on QUANTISEQ algorithm, predicted the relationship between the EFNA genes and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), and analyzed the relationship between the EFNA family genes and immune checkpoints. Results: The expression of EFNA1, EFNA3, EFNA4, and EFNA5 was elevated in pan-cancer. Compared with normal adjacent tissues, EFNA1, EFNA3, and EFNA4 were up-regulated in gastric cancer. In terms of the influence on the survival of patients, the expression of EFNA3 and EFNA4 were related to overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with gastric cancer. High expression of EFNA5 often predicted poor OS and DFS. In gastric cancer, the expression of EFNA3 and EFNA4 showed a significant negative correlation with B cells. The higher the expression of EFNA5, the higher the abundance of B cells, CD4+T cells and macrophages. CD8+T cells, dendritic cells infiltration and EFNA1-4 expression were negatively correlated. The infiltration of CD4+T cells, macrophages and neutrophils was negatively correlated with the expression of EFNA1, EFNA3, and EFNA4. TMB and MSI were positively correlated with EFNA3/EFNA4 expression. In the tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivity, EFNA3/4/5 also showed a significant correlation. In addition, we explored the relationship between the EFNA family genes and the immune microenvironment (B cells, M2 macrophages, monocytes, CD8+ T cells, regulatory T cells, myeloid dendritic cells, natural killer cells, non-regulatory CD4+ T cells), immune checkpoint (PDCD1, PDCD1LG2, CD274, CTLA4), and IC50 of common chemotherapeutic drugs for gastric cancer (5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, docetaxel and gemcitabine). Conclusions: Our study provides new ideas for tumor treatment and prognosis from the perspective of TIME, and nominates EFNA1-5 to become potential therapeutic targets for gastric cancer. 
66	35309930	LGMDR1 is caused by mutations in the CAPN3 gene that encodes calpain 3 (CAPN3), a non-lysosomal cysteine protease necessary for proper muscle function. Our previous findings show that CAPN3 deficiency leads to reduced SERCA levels through increased protein degradation. This work investigates the potential contribution of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to increased SERCA degradation in LGMDR1. Consistent with our previous results, we observed that CAPN3-deficient human myotubes exhibit reduced SERCA protein levels and high cytosolic calcium concentration. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) increased SERCA2 protein levels and normalized intracellular calcium levels in CAPN3-deficient myotubes. Moreover, bortezomib was able to recover mutated CAPN3 protein in a patient carrying R289W and R546L missense mutations. We found that CAPN3 knockout mice (C3KO) presented SERCA deficits in skeletal muscle in the early stages of the disease, prior to the manifestation of muscle deficits. However, treatment with bortezomib (0.8 mg/kg every 72 h) for 3 weeks did not rescue SERCA levels. No change in muscle proteasome activity was observed in bortezomib-treated animals, suggesting that higher bortezomib doses are needed to rescue SERCA levels in this model. Overall, our results lay the foundation for exploring inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome as a new therapeutic target to treat LGMDR1 patients. Moreover, patients carrying missense mutations in CAPN3 and presumably other genes may benefit from proteasome inhibition by rescuing mutant protein levels. Further studies in suitable models will be necessary to demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of proteasome inhibition for different missense mutations. 
67	35309917	Macroautophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system work as an interconnected network in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Indeed, efficient activation of macroautophagy upon nutritional deprivation is sustained by degradation of preexisting proteins by the proteasome. However, the specific substrates that are degraded by the proteasome in order to activate macroautophagy are currently unknown. By quantitative proteomic analysis we identified several proteins downregulated in response to starvation independently of ATG5 expression. Among them, the most significant was HERPUD1, an ER membrane protein with low expression and known to be degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions. Contrary, under ER stress, levels of HERPUD1 increased rapidly due to a blockage in its proteasomal degradation. Thus, we explored whether HERPUD1 stability could work as a negative regulator of autophagy. In this work, we expressed a version of HERPUD1 with its ubiquitin-like domain (UBL) deleted, which is known to be crucial for its proteasome degradation. In comparison to HERPUD1-WT, we found the UBL-deleted version caused a negative role on basal and induced macroautophagy. Unexpectedly, we found stabilized HERPUD1 promotes ER remodeling independent of unfolded protein response activation observing an increase in stacked-tubular structures resembling previously described tubular ER rearrangements. Importantly, a phosphomimetic S59D mutation within the UBL mimics the phenotype observed with the UBL-deleted version including an increase in HERPUD1 stability and ER remodeling together with a negative role on autophagy. Moreover, we found UBL-deleted version and HERPUD1-S59D trigger an increase in cellular size, whereas HERPUD1-S59D also causes an increased in nuclear size. Interestingly, ER remodeling by the deletion of the UBL and the phosphomimetic S59D version led to an increase in the number and function of lysosomes. In addition, the UBL-deleted version and phosphomimetic S59D version established a tight ER-lysosomal network with the presence of extended patches of ER-lysosomal membrane-contact sites condition that reveals an increase of cell survival under stress conditions. Altogether, we propose stabilized HERPUD1 downregulates macroautophagy favoring instead a closed interplay between the ER and lysosomes with consequences in drug-cell stress survival. 
68	35309911	Melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, is on the rise globally. The generally poor prognosis makes melanoma still an enormous public health problem. Ferroptosis is a newly emerging form of iron-dependent regulated cell death, which has been implicated in the development and treatment of several tumors. However, whether there is a connection between ferroptosis-related genes and the prognosis of melanoma patients remains an enigma. In the present study, we identified a ferroptosis-related genes signature to predict the prognosis of melanoma patients by analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Single-cell trajectory analysis was performed to explore malignant differentiation. CellChat was used to investigate intercellular communications in melanoma. Collectively, a novel four-gene signature (CP, MAP1LC3A, transferrin, and TP53) was constructed for prognosis prediction. COX proportional hazards regression analysis showed that the established ferroptosis-associated risk model was an independent prognostic predictor for melanoma patients (HR = 2.3293; 95%CI 1.1528-4.706) (p < 0.018). Patients with low-risk scores had significantly better overall survival (OS) than those with high-risk scores in The Cancer Genome Atlas, GSE59455, and GSE22153 dataset (p = 0.0015, p = 0.031, p = 0.077). Furthermore, the gene expression level of the four genes were verified in multistrain melanoma cell lines and normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM). The protein expression level of the four genes in clinical samples were further verified in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases. Taken together, our study identified the prognostic significance of the ferroptosis-related genes in melanoma and developed a novel four-gene prognostic signature, which may shed light on the prognostic assessment and clinical decision making for melanoma patients. 
69	35309908	The centrosome is composed of a pair of centrioles and serves as the major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in cells. Centrosome dysfunction has been linked to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), which is a rare human neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by small brain size with intellectual disability. Recently, several mouse models carrying mutated genes encoding centrosomal proteins have been generated to address the genotype-phenotype relationships in MCPH. However, several human-specific features were not observed in the mouse models during brain development. Herein, we generated isogenic hiPSCs carrying the gene encoding centrosomal CPAP-E1235V mutant protein using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, and examined the phenotypic features of wild-type and mutant hiPSCs and their derived brain organoids. Our results showed that the CPAP-E1235V mutant perturbed the recruitment of several centriolar proteins involved in centriole elongation, including CEP120, CEP295, CENTROBIN, POC5, and POC1B, onto nascent centrioles, resulting in the production of short centrioles but long cilia. Importantly, our wild-type hiPSC-derived brain organoid recapitulated many cellular events seen in the developing human brain, including neuronal differentiation and cortical spatial lamination. Interestingly, hiPSC-CPAP-E1235V-derived brain organoids induced p53-dependent neuronal cell death, resulting in the production of smaller brain organoids that mimic the microcephaly phenotype. Furthermore, we observed that the CPAP-E1235V mutation altered the spindle orientation of neuronal progenitor cells and induced premature neuronal differentiation. In summary, we have shown that the hiPSC-derived brain organoid coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology can recapitulate the centrosome/centriole-associated MCPH pathological features. Possible mechanisms for MCPH with centriole/centrosome dysfunction are discussed. 
70	35309563	Alzheimer's disease with psychosis (AD+P) is a heritable phenotypic variant of the disease which is associated with more rapid cognitive deterioration compared to Alzheimer's disease without psychosis (AD-P). Cognitive decline in AD correlates with synapse loss, and our previous studies suggest that those with AD+P have a differentially affected synaptic proteome relative to those with AD-P. In this study, we utilized RNA-sequencing of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in a cohort of 80 AD cases to evaluate novel transcriptomic signatures that may confer risk of psychosis in AD. We found that AD+P was associated with a 9% reduction in excitatory neuron proportion compared to AD-P [Mean (SD) AD+P 0.295 (0.061); AD-P 0.324 (0.052), p = 0.026]. mRNA levels contributed only modestly to altered synaptic proteins in AD+P relative to AD-P. Instead, network analysis identified altered expression of gene modules from protein ubiquitination, unfolded protein response, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (EIF2) signaling and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways in AD+P. We previously found that neuropathologies account for ~18% of the variance in the occurrence of psychosis in AD. Further inclusion of cell type proportions and differentially expressed modules increased the percent of the variance in psychosis occurrence accounted for in our AD cohort to 67.5%. 
71	35309442	Malaria is a vector-borne disease. It is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Plasmodium yoelii is a rodent model parasite, primarily used for studying parasite development in liver cells and vectors. To better understand parasite biology, we carried out a high-throughput-based proteomic analysis of P. yoelii. From the same mass spectrometry (MS)/MS data set, we also captured several post-translational modified peptides by following a bioinformatics analysis without any prior enrichment. Further, we carried out a proteogenomic analysis, which resulted in improvements to some of the existing gene models along with the identification of several novel genes. Analysis of proteome and post-translational modifications (PTMs) together resulted in the identification of 3124 proteins. The identified PTMs were found to be enriched in mitochondrial metabolic pathways. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis provided an insight into proteins associated with metabolic regulatory mechanisms. Among these, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the isoprenoid synthesis pathway are found to be essential for parasite survival and drug resistance. The proteogenomic analysis discovered 43 novel protein-coding genes. The availability of an in-depth proteomic landscape of a malaria pathogen model will likely facilitate further molecular-level investigations on pre-erythrocytic stages of malaria. 
72	35309438	Biofilm formation and hemolytic activity are closely related to the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus infections. Herein, we show that lapatinib (12.5 μM) significantly inhibits biofilm formation and hemolytic activity of both methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR, we found that the RNA levels of transcriptional regulatory genes (RNAIII, agrA, agrC, saeR, and saeS), biofilm-formation-related genes (atl, cidA, clfA, clfB, and icaA), and virulence-related genes (cap5A, hla, hld, hlg, lukDE, lukpvl-S, staphopain B, alpha-3 PSM, beta PSM, and delta PSM) of S. aureus decreased after 6 h treatment with lapatinib. Wild-type S. aureus isolates were continuously cultured in vitro in the presence of increasing concentrations of lapatinib for about 140 days. Subsequently, S. aureus isolates with reduced susceptibility to lapatinib (the inhibitory effect of lapatinib on the biofilm formation of these S. aureus isolates was significantly weakened) were selected. Mutations in the genomes of S. aureus isolates with reduced susceptibility to lapatinib were detected by whole-genome sequencing. We identified four genes with mutations: three genes with known functions (membrane protein, pyrrolidone-carboxylate peptidase, and sensor histidine kinase LytS, respectively) and one gene with unknown function (hypothetical protein). In conclusion, this study indicates that lapatinib significantly inhibits biofilm formation and the hemolytic activity of S. aureus. 
73	35309350	Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 and its ligand (anti-PD1/PDL1) have been proposed as a promising therapeutic option for advanced biliary tract cancer (aBTC). Given the scarce quantitative analyses of anti-PD1/PDL1 in aBTC, we thus did a meta-analysis to assess the benefits and risks of this emerging treatment strategy in patients with aBTC. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and meeting resources were searched for relevant studies. The main endpoints were median progression-free survival (mPFS), median overall survival (mOS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), any-grade adverse events (AEs), and grade 3-4 AEs. Twenty-eight studies with 1,338 participants were included. The best curative effect was found in the anti-PD1/PDL1 combined with anti-CTLA4 and chemotherapy group (mPFS: 12.4 months; mOS: 16.0 months; ORR: 45.1%; DCR: 95.0%), followed by the anti-PD1/PDL1 plus chemotherapy group (mPFS: 8.2 months; mOS: 14.8 months; ORR: 36.3%; DCR: 84.6%), the anti-PD1/PDL1 plus antiangiogenesis group (mPFS: 4.9 months; mOS: 10.2 months; ORR: 17.5%; DCR: 68.7%), the anti-PD1/PDL1 plus anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (anti-CTLA4) group (mPFS: 2.9 months; mOS: 8.3 months; ORR: 9.9%; DCR: 36.8%), and the anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy group (mPFS: 2.5 months; mOS: 7.6 months; ORR: 6.8%; DCR: 34.7%). Compared with anti-PD1-containing regimens, anti-PDL1-containing regimens achieved preferable mPFS (11.1 vs. 3.8 months), mOS (12.2 vs. 9.8 months), and ORR (23.7% vs. 17.4%), despite a similar DCR (61.1% vs. 61.3%). The mPFS, mOS, ORR, and DCR were 10.6 months, 15.8 months, 42.3%, and 88.6% of first-line anti-PD1/PDL1 and 3.0 months, 9.1 months, 11.6%, and 51.1% of second-line therapy or beyond, respectively. There were 80.6% and 34.0% of the patients suffering any-grade AEs and grade 3-4 AEs. Anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy might be considered as a safer alternative than combination regimens. Meanwhile, obvious toxicities in the first-line setting could not be neglected. Anti-PD1/PDL1 showed encouraging efficacy and acceptable safety profile in aBTC and, thus, could be an alternative treatment. 
74	35309349	Early diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PSA) is important for successful therapeutic intervention but currently remains challenging due, in part, to the scarcity of non-invasive biomarkers. In this study, we performed single cell profiling of transcriptome and cell surface protein expression to compare the peripheral blood immunocyte populations of individuals with PSA, individuals with cutaneous psoriasis (PSO) alone, and healthy individuals. We identified genes and proteins differentially expressed between PSA, PSO, and healthy subjects across 30 immune cell types and observed that some cell types, as well as specific phenotypic subsets of cells, differed in abundance between these cohorts. Cell type-specific gene and protein expression differences between PSA, PSO, and healthy groups, along with 200 previously published genetic risk factors for PSA, were further used to perform machine learning classification, with the best models achieving AUROC ≥ 0.87 when either classifying subjects among the three groups or specifically distinguishing PSA from PSO. Our findings thus expand the repertoire of gene, protein, and cellular biomarkers relevant to PSA and demonstrate the utility of machine learning-based diagnostics for this disease. 
75	35309318	The transforming growth factor-βs (TGF-βs) are multifunctional cytokines capable of regulating a wide range of cellular behaviors and play a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of the immune system. The TGF-β subfamily, which is only present in deuterostomes, expands from a single gene in invertebrates to multiple members in jawed vertebrates. However, the evolutionary processes of the TGF-β subfamily in vertebrates still lack sufficient elucidation. In this study, the TGF-β homologs are identified at the genome-wide level in the reissner lamprey (Lethenteron reissneri), the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), and the Japanese lamprey (Lampetra japonica), which are the extant representatives of jawless vertebrates with a history of more than 350 million years. The molecular evolutionary analyses reveal that the lamprey TGF-β subfamily contains two members representing ancestors of TGF-β2 and 3 in vertebrates, respectively, but TGF-β1 is absent. The transcriptional expression patterns show that the lamprey TGF-β2 may play a central regulatory role in the innate immune response of the lamprey since it exhibits a more rapid and significant upregulation of expression than TGF-β3 during lipopolysaccharide stimuli. The incorporation of BrdU assay reveals that the lamprey TGF-β2 recombinant protein exerts the bipolar regulation on the proliferation of the supraneural myeloid body cells (SMB cells) in the quiescent and LPS-activated state, while plays an inhibitory role in the proliferation of quiescent and activated leukocytes in lampreys. Furthermore, caspase-3/7 activity analysis indicates that the lamprey TGF-β2 protects SMB cells from apoptosis after serum deprivation, in contrast to promoting apoptosis of leukocytes. Our composite results offer valuable clues to the origin and evolution of the TGF-β subfamily and imply that TGF-βs are among the most ancestral immune regulators in vertebrates. 
76	35309312	Largemouth bass iridovirus (LMBV) can cause high mortality and lead to heavy economic loss in the cultivation of largemouth bass, but there was no effective treatment. Here, the present study constructed a recombinant Pichia pastoris expressing LMBV major capsid protein (MCPD). The recombinant GS115-pW317-MCPD was then used to immunize largemouth bass via oral administration, and mucosal immune response mediated by immunoglobulins (Igs) was measured after oral immunization. Serum antibody levels were measured by ELISA, neutralizing antibody titers were determined by serum neutralization test (SNT), antigen presentation-related gene expressions were detected by RT-PCR, and the histopathological characteristics of immunized fish were assessed after challenging with 0.1 ml 107.19 TCID50/ml LMBV. The relative percentage survival (RPS) was also determined. Our results showed that the serum antibody titers of immunized fish were significantly higher than that of control groups (P < 0.05). IgT and IgM expressions in gut were increased significantly after vaccination with GS115-pW317-MCPD; however, much stronger response in gut was observed as compared with gill. The expression levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, CD8, and T-cell receptor (TCR) were significantly elevated in GS115-pW317-MCPD group (P < 0.05), while CD4 and MHC I transcription levels remained unchanged after oral immunization (P > 0.05). The RPS of fish orally immunized with 1.0 × 108 CFU/g GS115-pW317-MCPD was reached up to 41.6% after challenge with 0.1 ml 109.46 TCID50/ml LMBV. Moreover, orally immunizing with GS115-pW317-MCPD can relieve the pathological damage caused by LMBV. Therefore, GS115-pW317-MCPD showed a promising potential against LMBV. 
77	35309308	Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) is an essential immune regulatory molecule that plays an important role in antigen presentation and T-cell development. Abnormal MHC II expression can lead to immunodeficiency, clinically termed as type II bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS), which usually results from mutations in the MHC II transactivator (CIITA) and other coactivators. Here, we present a new paradigm for MHC II deficiency in mice that involves a spontaneous point mutation on H2-Aa. A significantly reduced population of CD4+ T cells was observed in mice obtained from the long-term homozygous breeding of autophagy-related gene microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 β (Map1lc3b, Lc3b) knockout mice; this phenotype was not attributed to the original knocked-out gene. MHC II expression was generally reduced, together with a marked deficiency of H2-Aa in the immune cells of these mice. Using cDNA and DNA sequencing, a spontaneous H2-Aa point mutation that led to false pre-mRNA splicing, deletion of eight bases in the mRNA, and protein frameshift was identified in these mice. These findings led to the discovery of a new type of spontaneous MHC II deficiency and provided a new paradigm to explain type II BLS in mice. 
78	35309241	Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness affecting approximately 20 million individuals globally. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the illness. If left undiagnosed and untreated, schizophrenia results in impaired social function, repeated hospital admissions, reduced quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Clinical diagnosis largely relies on subjective evidence, including self-reported experiences, and reported behavioural abnormalities followed by psychiatric evaluation. In addition, psychoses may occur along with other conditions, and the symptoms are often episodic and transient, posing a significant challenge to the precision of diagnosis. Therefore, objective, specific tests using biomarkers are urgently needed for differential diagnosis of schizophrenia in clinical practice. We aimed to provide evidence-based and consensus-based recommendations, with a summary of laboratory measurements that could potentially be used as biomarkers for schizophrenia, and to discuss directions for future research. We searched publications within the last 10 years with the following keywords: 'schizophrenia', 'gene', 'inflammation', 'neurotransmitter', 'protein marker', 'gut microbiota', 'pharmacogenomics' and 'biomarker'. A draft of the consensus was discussed and agreed on by all authors at a round table session. We summarised the characteristics of candidate diagnostic markers for schizophrenia, including genetic, inflammatory, neurotransmitter, peripheral protein, pharmacogenomic and gut microbiota markers. We also proposed a novel laboratory process for diagnosing schizophrenia in clinical practice based on the evidence summarised in this paper. Further efforts are needed to identify schizophrenia-specific genetic and epigenetic markers for precise diagnosis, differential diagnosis and ethnicity-specific markers for the Chinese population. The development of novel laboratory techniques is making it possible to use these biomarkers clinically to diagnose disease. 
79	35309170	Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of a bacterial strain IITK SM2 isolated from an aquifer located in the middle Indo-Gangetic plain is reported here, along with its physiological, morphological, biochemical, and redox-transformation characteristics in the presence of dissolved arsenic (As). The aquifer exhibits oxidizing conditions relative to As speciation. Analyses based on 16S rRNA and recN sequences indicate that IITK SM2 was clustered with C. youngae NCTC 13708T and C. pasteuri NCTC UMH17T. However, WGS analyses using the digital DNA-DNA hybridization and Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology suggest that IITK SM2 belongs to a strain of C. youngae. This strain can effectively reduce As(V) to As(III) but cannot oxidize As(III) to As(V). It exhibited high resistance to As(V) [32,000 mg L-1] and As(III) [1,100 mg L-1], along with certain other heavy metals typically found in contaminated groundwater. WGS analysis also indicates the presence of As-metabolizing genes such as arsC, arsB, arsA, arsD, arsR, and arsH in this strain. Although these genes have been identified in several As(V)-reducers, the clustering of these genes in the forms of arsACBADR, arsCBRH, and an independent arsC gene has not been observed in any other Citrobacter species or other selected As(V)-reducing strains of Enterobacteriaceae family. Moreover, there were differences in the number of genes corresponding to membrane transporters, virulence and defense, motility, protein metabolism, phages, prophages, and transposable elements in IITK SM2 when compared to other strains. This genomic dataset will facilitate subsequent molecular and biochemical analyses of strain IITK SM2 to identify the reasons for high arsenic resistance in Citrobacter youngae and understand its role in As mobilization in middle Indo-Gangetic plain aquifers. 
80	35309168	Met proto-oncogene (MET) amplification and tyrosine-protein kinase Met (c-Met) overexpression confer gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The natural product Licochalcone A (Lico A) exhibits a broad range of inhibitory effects against various tumors. However, the effects of Lico A on c-Met signaling and gefitinib resistance in NSCLC remain unclear. In the present study, Lico A efficiently overcame gefitinib-acquired resistance in NSCLC cells by suppressing c-Met signaling. Lico A decreased cell viability and colony formation dose-dependently and impaired in vivo tumorigenesis of gefitinib-resistant HCC827 and PC-9 cells. Furthermore, Lico A induced intrinsic apoptosis and upregulated the protein expression levels of cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase and cleaved caspase 3. Lico A promoted the interaction between c-Met and E3 ligase c-Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl), which enhanced c-Cbl-mediated c-Met ubiquitination and degradation. Depletion of c-Cbl compromised Lico A-induced c-Met ubiquitination and its inhibitory efficacy in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Taken together, the results suggest that Lico A is a promising antitumor agent that might be used to overcome c-Met overexpression-mediated gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells. 
81	35309143	Background: 46,XY disorders/differences of sex development (46,XY DSD) are congenital conditions that result from abnormal gonadal development (gonadal dysgenesis) or abnormalities in androgen synthesis or action. During early embryonic development, several genes are involved in regulating the initiation and maintenance of testicular or ovarian-specific pathways. Recent reports have shown that MAP3K1 genes mediate the development of the 46,XY DSD, which present as complete or partial gonadal dysgenesis. Previous functional studies have demonstrated that some MAP3K1 variants result in the gain of protein function. However, data on possible mechanisms of MAP3K1 genes in modulating protein functions remain scant. Methods: This study identified a Han Chinese family with the 46,XY DSD. To assess the history and clinical manifestations for the 46,XY DSD patients, the physical, operational, ultra-sonographical, pathological, and other examinations were performed for family members. Variant analysis was conducted using both trio whole-exome sequencing (trio WES) and Sanger sequencing. On the other hand, we generated transiently transfected testicular teratoma cells (NT2/D1) and ovary-derived granular cells (KGN), with mutant or wild-type MAP3K1 gene. We then performed functional assays such as determination of steady-state levels of gender related factors, protein interaction and luciferase assay system. Results: Two affected siblings were diagnosed with 46,XY DSD. Our analysis showed a missense c.556A > G/p.R186G variant in the MAP3K1 gene. Functional assays demonstrated that the MAP3K1R186G variant was associated with significantly decreased affinity to ubiquitin (Ub; 43-49%) and increased affinity to RhoA, which was 3.19 ± 0.18 fold, compared to MAP3K1. The MAP3K1R186G led to hyperphosphorylation of p38 and GSK3β, and promoted hyperactivation of the Wnt4/β-catenin signaling. In addition, there was increased recruitment of β-catenin into the nucleus, which enhanced the expression of pro-ovarian transcription factor FOXL2 gene, thus contributing to the 46,XY DSD. Conclusion: Our study identified a missense MAP3K1 variant associated with 46,XY DSD. We demonstrated that MAP3K1R186G variant enhances binding to the RhoA and improves its own stability, resulting in the activation of the Wnt4/β-catenin/FOXL2 pathway. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of 46,XY DSD and promotes better clinical evaluation. 
82	35309123	"Background: Forkhead box ""O"" one which is member of Forkhead box family of transcription factors is known to play key role in different physiological processes including cell cycle arrest, autophagy, and apoptosis. FOXO1 is defined to play tumor suppressive role in various malignancies including breast cancer and its Dysregulation is frequently reported. However, the evaluation of FOXO1 promoter methylation and its expression at mRNA and protein level in different stages of breast cancer and its association with different clinical parameters is still not studied. Therefore, for better understanding the role of FOXO1 in breast cancer, in our study we examined the FOXO1 mRNA and protein expression in Breast cancer samples of Indian breast cancer patients. Results: Total 127 breast cancer samples along with adjacent normal tissue (n = 127) were analyzed through methylation specific PCR (MS-PCR), mRNA expression (Real-time PCR) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). We detected 69.29% cases to be downregulated at the mRNA level, and 77.95% of cases exhibited no or low protein expression. In our data we report a significant association (p = 0.0001) between the downregulated protein expression and promoter hypermethylation of FOXO1 gene. We also found a significant correlation of FOXO1 mRNA level with Age (p = 0.008), age at first live birth (p = 0,003), tumor size (p = 0.05) and lymph node status (p = 0.01). Conclusion: we in our study report the tumor suppressive role of FOXO1 in case of Indian breast cancer patients and our data suggest it to exhibit prognostic importance. However, further research is needed to evaluate FOXO1 significance in diagnostic and therapeutic targeting in breast cancer cases. "
83	35309121	Citrullinemia is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by elevated concentrations of citrulline in the blood resulting from malfunction of the urea cycle. It is categorized into two types, types I and II, which are caused by argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1), and citrin (SLC25A13) gene mutations, respectively. In this study, we performed genetic analysis on nine Chinese infants with citrullinemia using next-generation sequencing, which identified a novel mutation (p.Leu313Met) and a rare mutation (p.Thr323Ile, rs1250895424) of ASS1. We also found a novel splicing mutation of SLC25A13: c.1311 + 4_+7del. Functional analysis of the ASS1 missense mutations showed that both significantly impaired the enzyme activity of ASS1, with the p. Thr323Ile mutation clearly affecting the interaction between ASS1 and protein arginine methyltransferase 7 (PRMT7). These findings expand the mutational spectrum of ASS1 and SLC25A13, and further our understanding of the molecular genetic mechanism of citrullinemia in the Chinese population. 
84	35308874	Early life adversity is a risk factor for depression in adulthood; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of DNA methylation of DRD2 gene on early life stress-induced depression in adult rats. Newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: maternal deprivation group (MD), chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) group, maternal deprivation plus chronic unpredictable stress (MD/CUS) group, and normal control group (NOR). Behaviors were measured by open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT), and Original Research Article forced swimming test (FST). Fecal CORT level was detected by ELISA. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing PCR was used to assess methylation levels of DRD2 promoter. CUS and MD/CUS rats had a significantly shorter total distance, longer immobility time, and higher CORT level, while MD and MD/CUS rats had a significantly lower percentage of central distance, more feces, lower rate of sucrose preference, and lower levels of DRD2 protein and mRNA in the VTA than NOR rats. CUS rats showed a significantly higher DRD2 mRNA and protein levels in the VTA than NOR rats. CUS, MD, and MD/CUS rats showed a significantly higher level of DRD2 promoter methylation than NOR rats. CORT level was significantly correlated with the sucrose preference rate in SPT, the immobility time in FST, the total distance, and the number of fecal pellets in OFT. DRD2 protein level was significantly correlated with the sucrose preference rate and the number of fecal pellets. DRD2 mRNA level was significantly correlated with the percentage of central distance and the number of fecal pellets in OFT. The level of DRD2 promoter methylation was significantly correlated with the sucrose preference rate, immobility time, total distance, the percentage of central distance, and the number of fecal pellets. Early life MD increased vulnerability to stress-induced depressive-like behavior in adult rats. Enhanced DRD2 promoter methylation in the VTA may increase the susceptibility to depression. 
85	35308827	The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large protein assembly that perforates the nuclear envelope and provides a sole gateway for traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The NPC controls the nucleocytoplasmic transport by selectively allowing cargoes such as proteins and mRNA to pass through its central channel, thereby playing a vital role in protecting the nuclear component and regulating gene expression and protein synthesis. The selective transport through the NPC originates from its exquisite molecular structure featuring a large scaffold and the intrinsically disordered central channel domain, but the exact mechanism underlying the selective transport remains elusive and is the subject of various, often conflicting, hypotheses. Moreover, recent studies have suggested a new role for the NPC as a mechanosensor, where the NPC changes its channel diameter depending on the nuclear envelope tension, altering the molecular transportability through this nanopore. In this mini-review, we summarize the current understandings of the selective nature of the NPC and discuss its emerging role in cellular mechanotransduction. 
86	35308788	Glyconanomaterials with unique nanoscale property and carbohydrate functionality show vast potential in biological and biomedical applications. We investigated the interactions of noncovalent complexes of single-wall carbon nanotubes that are wrapped by disaccharide lactose-containing glycopolymers with the specific carbohydrate-binding proteins. The terminal galactose (Gal) of glycopolymers binds to the specific lectin as expected. Interestingly, an increased aggregation of nanotubes was also observed when interacting with a glucose (Glc) specific lectin, likely due to the removal of Glc groups from the surface of nanotubes resulting from the potential binding of the lectin to the Glc in the glycopolymers. This result indicates that the wrapping conformation of glycopolymers on the surface of nanotubes potentially allows improved accessibility of the Glc for specific lectins. Furthermore, it shows that the interaction between Glc groups in the glycopolymers and nanotubes play a key role in stabilizing the nanocomplexes. Overall, our results demonstrate that nanostructures can enable conformation-dependent interactions of glycopolymers and proteins and can potentially lead to the creation of versatile optical sensors for detecting carbohydrate-protein interactions with enhanced specificity and sensitivity. 
87	35308572	The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a very important role in the development of sarcoma (SARC), but it is still unknown how to effectively regulate the TME. Our study aims to identify core molecules that can concurrently regulate immune and stromal cells in TME as potential therapeutic targets. We used the ESTIMATE algorithm to score the immune and stromal components of 265 SARC samples and determined that increased immune and stromal components in TME were both associated with poor prognosis in SARC. Next, we identified differential genes that regulate both immune and stromal cells, and identified the core prognostic gene CCR2 through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, COX analysis, survival analysis, and GSEA enrichment analysis. Next, we calculated the content of infiltrating immune cells and stromal cells in tumors using the CIBERSORT and xcell algorithms, respectively. Using differential analysis and Spearman correlation analysis, we identified 12 immune cells and 7 stromal cells, including CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), Fibroblasts and Endothelial cells, all of which were regulated by CCR2. Increased immune and stromal cell components were associated with poor prognosis in SARC, and CCR2 had a prognostic role in TME, regulating multiple immune and stromal cells, and was an important target for TME remodeling as well as immunotherapy in SARC. 
88	35308509	To discuss the histological features, pathological types, and prognosis of gastric adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation. Specimens of 189 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation were collected for detailed histomorphology, immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and follow-up. In accordance with the morphological and histological structural features of the cancer cells as well as the area ratio of the mucus, gastric adenocarcinoma with mucinous differentiation was divided into four types, namely pure mucinous carcinoma, intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma, signet ring cell type mucinous carcinoma, and mixed cell type mucinous carcinoma. Based on the macroscopic types according to Bormann's classification, pure mucinous carcinoma was mostly Type I, intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was mostly Type II, signet ring cell type mucinous carcinoma was mostly Type IV, and mixed cell type mucinous carcinoma was mostly Type III. The 5-year survival rate was 69.2, 64.2, 0, and 31.5%, respectively. There was a statistical difference in the lymph node metastasis rate and survival rate of the four carcinoma types. The invasion features of pure mucinous carcinoma entailed penetrating corrosively in a push-in form, without blood vessel or lymphatic metastasis and with few lymphocytes and lymphatic nodules in the marginal area. Thus, there was little lymph node metastasis and invasion of nerves. The HER2 protein expression rate was 40.2% (76/189), the HER2 gene amplification detected by FISH technology was 16.9% (32/189). The independent histological type, four subtypes, and histopathological classification of gastric mucinous adenocarcinoma are important for the prognosis evaluation and precise treatment of this disease. 
89	35308386	Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and pseudorabies (PR) are highly infectious swine diseases and cause significant financial loss in China. The respiratory system and reproductive system are the main target systems. Previous studies showed that the existing PR virus (PRV) and PRRS virus (PRRSV) commercial vaccines could not provide complete protection against PRV variant strains and NADC30-like PRRSV strains in China. In this study, the PRV variant strain XJ and NADC30-like PRRSV strain CHSCDJY-2019 are used as the parent for constructing a recombinant pseudorabies virus (rPRV)-NC56 with gE/gI/TK gene deletion and co-expressing NADC30-like PRRSV GP5 and M protein. The rPRV-NC56 proliferated stably in BHK-21 cells, and it could stably express GP5 and M protein. Due to the introduction of the self-cleaving 2A peptide, GP5 and M protein were able to express independently and form virus-like particles (VLPs) of PRRSV in rPRV-NC56-infected BHK-21 cells. The rPRV-NC56 is safe for use in mice; it can colonize and express the target protein in mouse lungs for a long time. Vaccination with rPRV-NC56 induces PRV and NADC30-like PRRSV specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and protects 100% of mice from virulent PRV XJ strain. Furthermore, the virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA) elicited by rPRV-NC56 showed significantly lower titer against SCNJ-2016 (HP-PRRSV) than that against CHSCDJY-2019 (NADC30-like PRRSV). Thus, rPRV-NC56 appears to be a promising candidate vaccine against NADC30-like PRRSV and PRV for the control and eradication of the variant PRV and NADC30-like PRRSV. 
90	35308382	Vaccine development against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been of primary importance to contain the ongoing global pandemic. However, studies have demonstrated that vaccine effectiveness is reduced and the immune response is evaded by variants of concern (VOCs), which include Alpha, Beta, Delta, and, the most recent, Omicron. Subsequently, several vaccine breakthrough (VBT) infections have been reported among healthcare workers (HCWs) due to their prolonged exposure to viruses at healthcare facilities. We conducted a clinico-genomic study of ChAdOx1 (Covishield) VBT cases in HCWs after complete vaccination. Based on the clinical data analysis, most of the cases were categorized as mild, with minimal healthcare support requirements. These patients were divided into two sub-phenotypes based on symptoms: mild and mild plus. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of specific clinical parameters with VBT sub-phenotypes. Viral genomic sequence analysis of VBT cases revealed a spectrum of high- and low-frequency mutations. More in-depth analysis revealed the presence of low-frequency mutations within the functionally important regions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Emphasizing the potential benefits of surveillance, low-frequency mutations, D144H in the N gene and D138Y in the S gene, were observed to potentially alter the protein secondary structure with possible influence on viral characteristics. Substantiated by the literature, our study highlights the importance of integrative analysis of pathogen genomic and clinical data to offer insights into low-frequency mutations that could be a modulator of VBT infections. 
91	35308356	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play a key role in many food fermentations. However, some LAB species can also cause food spoilage, e.g., through the formation of biogenic amines. Paucilactobacillus wasatchensis is a LAB that causes late gas production in Cheddar cheese, the molecular causes of which are not fully understood. This study reports on the ability of P. wasatchensis WDC04 to produce cadaverine and putrescine in broth supplemented with lysine and ornithine, as well as in a model cheese. The raclette-type semi-hard cheese produced with P. wasatchensis as an adjunct culture contained 1,085 mg kg-1 of cadaverine and 304 mg kg-1 of putrescine after 120 days of ripening. We identified two ornithine decarboxylase genes (odc) and a putrescine-ornithine antiporter gene (potE) in the genome sequence of P. wasatchensis. We could show that the two odc genes, which are located on two contigs, are contiguous and form the genetic cluster odc2-odc1-potE. Alignment searches showed that similar gene clusters exist in the genomes of Levilactobacillus paucivorans DSMZ22467, Lentilactobacillus kribbianus YH-lac9, Levilactobacillus hunanensis 151-2B, and Levilactobacillus lindianensis 220-4. More amino acid sequence comparisons showed that Odc1 and Odc2 shared 72 and 69% identity with a lysine and ornithine decarboxylase from Ligilactobacillus saerimneri 30a, respectively. To clarify the catalytic activities of both enzymes, the odc-coding genes were cloned and heterologously expressed as His-tagged fusion protein. The purified Odc1 protein decarboxylated lysine into cadaverine, while the recombinant Odc2 protein preferentially produced putrescine from ornithine but also exhibited low lysine decarboxylating activity. Both enzymes were active at pH of 5.5, a value often found in cheese. To our knowledge, this is only the second lysine decarboxylase in LAB whose function has been verified. The tandem arrangement of the genes in a single cluster suggests a gene duplication, evolving the ability to metabolize more amino. Divergent substrate preferences highlight the necessity of verifying the functions of genes, in addition to automatic annotation based on sequence similarity. Acquiring new biochemical data allows better predictive models and, in this case, more accurate biogenic amine production potential for LAB strains and microbiomes. 
92	35308334	Pears (Pyrus sp.) are widely cultivated in China, and their yield accounts for more than 60% of global pear production. The fungal pathogen Valsa pyri is a major causal agent of pear canker disease, which results in enormous losses of pear production in northern China. In this study, we characterized a Zn2Cys6 transcription factor that contains one GAL4 domain and a fungal-trans domain, which are present in VpxlnR. The vpxlnR gene expression was upregulated in the invasion stage of V. pyri. To investigate its functions, we constructed gene deletion mutants and complementary strains. We observed that the growth of the vpxlnR mutants was reduced on potato dextrose agar (PDA), Czapek plus glucose or sucrose compared with that of the wild-type strain. Additionally, vpxlnR mutants exhibited loss of function in fruiting body formation. Moreover, vpxlnR mutants were more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and salicylic acid (SA) and were reduced in their virulence at the early infection stage. According to a previous study, VpxlnR-interacting motifs containing NRHKGNCCGM were searched in the V. pyri genome, and we obtained 354 target genes, of which 148 genes had Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) terms. PHI-BLAST was used to identify virulence-related genes, and we found 28 hits. Furthermore, eight genes from the 28 PHI-BLAST hits were further assessed by yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assays, and five target genes, salicylate hydroxylase (VP1G_09520), serine/threonine-protein kinase (VP1G_03128), alpha-xylosidase (VP1G_06369), G-protein beta subunit (VP1G_02856), and acid phosphatase (VP1G_03782), could interact with VpxlnR in vivo. Their transcript levels were reduced in one or two vpxlnR mutants. Taken together, these findings imply that VpxlnR is a key regulator of growth, development, stress, and virulence through controlling genes involved in signaling pathways and extracellular enzyme activities in V. pyri. The motifs interacting with VpxlnR also provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of xlnR proteins. 
93	35308230	Praliciguat is a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator that elicits hemodynamic, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic effects in preclinical models of metabolic dysfunction. We assessed the metabolic effects of praliciguat in a mouse diet-induced obesity (DIO) model housed at thermoneutrality. At 6 weeks old, male C57BL/6N mice were either maintained on low-fat diet (LFD, lean mice) or placed on 60% high-fat diet (HFD, DIO mice). At 14 weeks old, the DIO mice were either maintained on HFD or switched to HFD with praliciguat (6-mg/kg). Day 28 samples were collected for biomarker analysis. In a second study under the same paradigm, indirect calorimetry was performed on days 8, 9, 20, 21, 32, and 33 and an oral lipid tolerance test (LTT) on day 38. Mice treated 28 days with praliciguat had lower levels of fasting plasma insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, and HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) than DIO controls. In addition, energy expenditure was higher in praliciguat-treated than in DIO control mice on days 9, 20, 32, and 33; and day-38 triglycerides were lower. HFD-induced increases in gene expression of liver TNF-ɑ, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), and patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (Pnpla3) in control DIO mice were attenuated in praliciguat-treated DIO mice. The positive metabolic effects observed in praliciguat-treated mice were associated with the restoration of liver PI3K (pAKT-Thr308) signaling, but not MAPK (pERK). In conclusion, praliciguat-treated DIO mice had increased energy utilization, improved insulin sensitivity, and lower plasma triglycerides. These results illustrate metabolic effects associated with praliciguat treatment in DIO mice. 
94	35308213	Objective: Magnolia volatile oil (MVO) is a mixture mainly containing eudesmol and its isomers. This study was to investigate the vasorelaxant effects and the underlying mechanism of MVO in rat thoracic aortas. Method: The present study combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and network pharmacology analysis with in vitro experiments to clarify the mechanisms of MVO against vessel contraction. A compound-target network, compound-target-disease network, protein-protein interaction network, compound-target-pathway network, gene ontology, and pathway enrichment for hypertension were applied to identify the potential active compounds, drug targets, and pathways. Additionally, the thoracic aortic rings with or without endothelium were prepared to explore the underlying mechanisms. The roles of the PI3K-Akt-NO pathways, neuroreceptors, K+ channels, and Ca2+ channels on the vasorelaxant effects of MVO were evaluated through the rat thoracic aortic rings. Results: A total of 29 compounds were found in MVO, which were identified by GC-MS, of which 21 compounds with a content of more than 0.1% were selected for further analysis. The network pharmacology research predicted that beta-caryophyllene, palmitic acid, and (+)-β-selinene might act as the effective ingredients of MVO for the treatment of hypertension. Several hot targets, mainly involving TNF, CHRM1, ACE, IL10, PTGS2, REN, and F2, and pivotal pathways, such as the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the calcium signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling, were responsible for the vasorelaxant effect of MVO. As expected, MVO exerted a vasorelaxant effect on the aortic rings pre-contracted by KCl and phenylephrine in an endothelium-dependent and non-endothelium-dependent manner. Importantly, a pre-incubation with indomethacin (Indo), N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, methylene blue, wortmannin, and atropine sulfate as well as 4-aminopyridione diminished MVO-induced vasorelaxation, suggesting that the activation of the PI3K-Akt-NO pathway and KV channel were involved in the vasorelaxant effect of MVO, which was consistent with the results of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and the Genomes. Additionally, MVO could significantly inhibit Ca2+ influx resulting in the contraction of aortic rings, revealing that the inhibition of the calcium signaling pathway exactly participated in the vasorelaxant activity of MVO as predicted by network pharmacology. Conclusion: MVO might be a potent treatment of diseases with vascular dysfunction like hypertension. The underlying mechanisms were related to the PI3K-Akt-NO pathway, KV pathway, as well as Ca2+ channel, which were predicted by the network pharmacology and verified by the experiments in vitro. This study based on network pharmacology provided experimental support for the clinical application of MVO in the treatment of hypertension and afforded a novel research method to explore the activity and mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine. 
95	35308126	Autophagy modulators are considered putative therapeutic targets because of the role of autophagy in cancer progression. Kazinol C, a 1,3-diphenylpropane from the plant Broussonetia kazinoki, has been shown to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells through the activation of AMPK at high concentrations. In the present study, we found that Kazinol C induced autophagy through endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated unfolded protein response signaling in several normal and cancer cell lines at low concentrations of Kazinol C that did not induce apoptosis. Kazinol C activated the transducers of unfolded protein response signaling, leading to target gene expression, LC3-II conversion, and TFEB nuclear translocation. Chemical inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress reduced LC3-II conversion. In addition, blockade of autophagy by knockout of Atg5 or treatment with 3-MA enhanced Kazinol C-induced apoptosis. In summary, we have uncovered Kazinol C as a novel autophagy inducer and confirmed the role of autophagy as a cellular stress protector. 
96	35308122	Mutations in the GJB2 gene that encodes connexin 26 (Cx26) are the predominant cause of prelingual hereditary deafness, and the most frequently encountered variants cause complete loss of protein function. To investigate how Cx26 deficiency induces deafness, we examined the levels of apoptosis and autophagy in Gjb2 loxP/loxP; ROSA26 CreER mice injected with tamoxifen on the day of birth. After weaning, these mice exhibited severe hearing impairment and reduced Cx26 expression in the cochlear duct. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positive cells were observed in apical, middle, and basal turns of Kölliker's organ at postnatal (P) day 1 (P1), associated with increased expression levels of cleaved caspase 3, but decreased levels of autophagy-related proteins LC3-II, P62, and Beclin1. In Kölliker's organ cells with decreased Cx26 expression, we also found significantly reduced levels of intracellular ATP and hampered Ca2+ responses evoked by extracellular ATP application. These results offer novel insight into the mechanisms that prevent hearing acquisition in mouse models of non-syndromic hearing impairment due to Cx26 loss of function. 
97	35308041	The blood-brain barrier (BBB), a selective barrier formed by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), represents a major challenge for the efficient accumulation of pharmaceutical drugs into the brain. The receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) has recently gained increasing interest for pharmaceutical industry as it shows a great potential to shuttle large-sized therapeutic cargos across the BBB. Confirming the presence of the RMT pathway by BMEC is therefore important for the screening of peptides or antibody libraries that bind RMT receptors. Herein, a comparative study was performed between a human cell line of BMEC (HBEC) and human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived BMEC-like cells (hiPS-BMEC). The significantly higher gene and protein expressions of transporters and tight junction proteins, excepting CD31 and VE-cadherin were exhibited by hiPS-BMEC than by HBEC, suggesting more biomimetic BBB features of hiPS-BMEC. The presence and functionality of transferrin receptor (TfR), known to use RMT pathway, were confirmed using hiPS-BMEC by competitive binding assays and confocal microscopy observations. Finally, cysteine-modified T7 and cysteine modified-Tfr-T12 peptides, previously reported to be ligands of TfR, were compared regarding their permeability using hiPS-BMEC. The hiPS-BMEC could be useful for the identification of therapeutics that can be transported across the BBB using RMT pathway. 
98	35308003	Immunotherapy can reverse tumor immune escape by suppressing immune checkpoints. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) is an important checkpoint and its role in colorectal cancer is not clear. In this study, we investigated LAG3 protein expression and its correlation with clinicopathologic parameters. The expression of LAG3 protein was assessed in 150 surgically resected colorectal cancer tissue samples by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between LAG3 expression and clinicopathological parameters, MSI status and survival was statistically analyzed. LAG3 protein was not expressed in colorectal cancer cells, and was expressed on the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in 31 out of 150 (20.7%) colorectal cancer samples. Positive expression of LAG3 in TILs is associated with lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), TNM stage (p = 0.024) and MSI-H (p = 0.035). No significant relationship was found between LAG3 expression and gender, age, tumor location, tumor invasion depth, and differentiation. LAG3 expression is associated with longer overall survival (p = 0.045). Our data show LAG3 expression on TILs in parts of CRC tissue. Positive expression of LAG3 was associated with advanced tumor stage, MSI-H and a poor prognosis. We conclude that LAG3 is an important checkpoint gene in CRC and may be a potential marker for prognosis of CRC. 
99	35307989	Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are essential elements of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, which have been widely implicated in pathways that contribute to leukemia growth and resistance. Recent reports showed genotypic and phenotypic alterations in leukemia patient-derived MSCs, indicating that MSCs might be educated/reprogrammed. However, the results have been inconclusive, possibly due to the heterogeneity of leukemia. Here, the authors report that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induces MSCs towards an adipogenic differentiation propensity. RNAseq analysis reveal significant upregulation of gene expression enriched in the adipocyte differentiation process and reduction in osteoblast differentiation. The alteration is accompanied by a metabolic switch from glycolysis to a more oxidative phosphorylation-dependent manner. Mechanistic studies identify that AML cell-derived exosomes play a vital role during the AML cell-mediated MSCs education/reprogramming process. Pre-administration of mice BM microenvironment with AML-derived exosomes greatly enhance leukemia engraftment in vivo. The quantitative proteomic analysis identified a list of exosomal protein components that are differently expressed in AML-derived exosomes, which represent an opportunity for novel therapeutic strategies based on the targeting of exosome-based AML cells-MSCs communication. Collectively, the data show that AML-educated MSCs tend to differentiate into adipocytes contributing to disease progression, which suggests complex interactions of leukemia with microenvironment components.
