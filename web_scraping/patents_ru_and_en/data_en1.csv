2698049,"BACKGROUND
      The family of Reoviridae comprises a structurally related group of viruses. Members of this family of viruses can cause infections of the gastrointestinal system and the respiratory tracts in mammals and birds. Some viruses of this family can also infect plants.
      The Reoviridae are non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA viruses made up of an icosahedral capsid that is typically composed of an outer protein layer and one or more inner protein layers. The genus Rotavirus forms part of the Reoviridae family. Rotaviruses form triple-layered virus particles. The outer layer of a rotavirus particle consists of a shell protein, VP7, and a spike protein, VP4; the middle layer consists of VP6; and the inner layer is formed by VP2. The triple-layered virus particle is infectious, after activation by trypsin. During rotavirus cell entry, the outer layer of the virus particles is removed by a mechanism dubbed “uncoating,” and the double-layered particle enters the cytoplasm. During cell entry, rotavirus penetrates a cellular membrane, possibly an endosomal membrane. The double-layered rotavirus particle is transcriptionally active. In the cytoplasm, it transcribes the genome, extruding mRNA through pores in its surface. The new transcripts are used to make rotavirus proteins and new double-stranded RNA genome segments, which are packaged into newly formed viral particles.
      For some Reoviridae, the uncoating process can be simulated in vitro using purified viral particles. In the case of rotaviruses, calcium chelation or heat shock causes uncoating of viral particles in vitro. Once the outer protein layer has been removed, the resulting rotavirus double-layered particles can be “recoated” with recombinantly expressed versions of the proteins that form the outer layer. By recoating with recombinant VP4 and VP7, infectious recoated rotavirus particles that closely resemble mature virions can be formed. By recoating with VP7 alone, triple-layered, spike-less particles, which are minimally infectious, can be formed. By genetically modifying the coding regions of individual proteins of the outer layer and expressing them recombinantly, the properties of the proteins making up the outer layer can be studied in recoating experiments without requiring the production of fully recombinant viruses. To describe these types of experiments, the term “recoating genetics” has been coined.
      In the case of reoviruses, the metastable state of the infectious subviral particle has allowed the use of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in elucidating the structural basis for the priming mechanism that is used by reoviruses to enter their host cells. Similarly, in vitro recoated rotavirus particles have been used to study the molecular interactions in rotavirus assembly and uncoating using cryo-EM. The present invention builds on the technological advances that were brought about by these recoating and cryo-EM studies.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The combination of high-resolution cryo-EM in combination with recoating genetics has made it possible to advance the use of the rotavirus model beyond the study of rotaviruses themselves. The inventors have found that rotavirus particles can be used for rapid structure determination of heterologous trimeric proteins that are displayed on the surface of modified rotavirus particles. Rotavirus particles modified to display heterologous trimeric proteins on their surface are also useful in producing a wide range of novel vaccines.
      The present invention provides rotavirus particles comprising a chimeric surface protein composed of a rotavirus surface protein linked to a heterologous protein. In one aspect of the invention, the rotavirus surface protein is linked to the heterologous protein via a linker sequence. In another aspect of the invention, the rotavirus surface protein is linked to the heterologous protein via an adapter system. In a preferred aspect of the invention, the heterologous protein is non-covalently bound to the rotavirus surface protein by a two-part adapter system, where one part of the adapter system is linked to the rotavirus surface protein and the other part of the adapter system is linked to the heterologous protein, whereby both parts of the adapter system form a stable complex thus non-covalently attaching the heterologous protein to the rotavirus surface protein. The chimeric surface protein can become part of the outer layer of the rotavirus particle by in vitro recoating double-layered rotavirus particles (DLPs) with it.
      The invention further provides a first nucleic acid comprising an open reading frame encoding a modified rotavirus surface protein comprising a rotavirus surface protein, a first adapter polypeptide and, optionally, a linker sequence. The invention also provides a second nucleic acid comprising an open reading frame encoding a fusion protein comprising a heterologous protein, a second adapter polypeptide and, optionally, a linker sequence. The first adapter polypeptide and the second adapter polypeptide are able to form a stable complex. Typically, the open reading frame in the nucleic acids of the invention is operationally linked to a promoter sequence. In some embodiments, the adapter polypeptide comprises a heptad repeat sequence. A cell containing a nucleic acid of the invention is also provided. The nucleic acids and cells containing the same may be used to prepare the chimeric surface proteins of the invention.
      The invention further relates to a kit comprising the first and second nucleic acid sequences of the invention. In some embodiments, a kit according to the invention may comprise a first nucleic acid encoding a modified rotavirus surface protein comprising a rotavirus surface protein and a first adapter polypeptide, and a second nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a second adapter polypeptide and a multiple cloning site, whereby insertion of a coding region for a heterologous protein in the multiple cloning site yields an open reading frame encoding a fusion protein comprising the heterologous protein and the second adapter polypeptide, wherein the first adapter polypeptide and the second adapter polypeptide are able to form a stable complex. The kits of the invention may further comprise a rotavirus particle. The rotavirus particle can be derived from the same species of rotavirus from which the rotavirus surface protein was derived or from a different species. For example, rhesus rotavirus VP7 can be used to recoat DLPs prepared from bovine rotavirus and vice versa.
      Rotavirus particles comprising a chimeric surface protein can be prepared by various methods. A preferred method of the invention involves propagating a native rotavirus particle comprising an outer layer in a cell grown in a culture medium, purifying the particles from the culture medium, removing the outer layer from the particle to obtain a rotavirus DLP, and recoating the rotavirus DLP with a one or more chimeric surface proteins to form a rotavirus particle comprising the chimeric surface protein or proteins. A native rotavirus particle is a triple-layered particle, wherein the outermost third layer forms the outer shell of the rotavirus particle.
      In a particular aspect, the invention relates to a first fusion protein comprising a trimer-forming rotavirus surface protein, a heptad repeat sequence, and optionally a linker sequence. The invention further provides a second fusion protein comprising a trimer-forming heterologous protein, a heptad repeat sequence, and optionally a linker sequence. The first fusion protein and the second fusion protein are able to form a stable complex via the heptad repeat sequences comprised in each of them. In some embodiments, the invention provides a chimeric surface protein formed by the first fusion protein and the second fusion protein. The chimeric surface protein may be displayed on the surface of a rotavirus particle.
      In one aspect of the invention, rotavirus particles comprising a chimeric surface protein are used for determining the structure of a heterologous protein that forms a portion of the chimeric surface protein. For example, the invention provides a method for obtaining a three-dimensional model of a chimeric surface protein, wherein the method comprises the steps of (i) recoating a rotavirus DLP with a chimeric surface protein comprising all or part of a heterologous protein to yield a suspension of rotavirus particles displaying the chimeric surface protein, (ii) freezing the suspension, (iii) imaging the rotavirus particles using cryo-EM to obtain a plurality of micrographs, and (iv) analysing the plurality of micrographs to obtain a three-dimensional model of the chimeric surface protein. In some embodiments, step (i) may be subdivided into two steps, namely (a) a recoating step in which the rotavirus DLP is recoated with a rotavirus surface protein comprising a first adapter to form rotavirus particles and (b) a binding step in which the recoated rotavirus DLP is incubated in the presence of a heterologous protein comprising a second adapter whereby a complex is formed between the first adapter and the second adapter resulting in a chimeric surface protein being displayed on the rotavirus particles. In some instances, the method can be modified to determining the structure of a heterologous protein bound to a molecule that specifically binds to the heterologous protein. The modified method comprises the steps of (i) recoating a rotavirus DLP with a chimeric surface protein comprising all or part of a heterologous protein to yield a suspension of rotavirus particles displaying the chimeric surface protein, (ii) adding to the suspension a molecule that specifically binds to the heterologous protein, wherein the molecule forms a complex with the chimeric surface protein, (iii) freezing the suspension, (iv) imaging the rotavirus particles using cryo-EM to obtain a plurality of micrographs, and (v) analysing the plurality of micrographs to obtain a three-dimensional model of the chimeric surface protein complexed to the molecule. The molecule may a proteinaceous molecule. For example, the proteinaceous molecule may be all or part of a receptor or antibody that specifically binds the heterologous protein. Alternatively, the proteinaceous molecule may be a polypeptide or peptide that specifically binds to the heterologous protein. In other embodiments, the molecule is a non-proteinaceous molecule. For instance, the non-proteinaceous molecule may be a nucleic acid.
      In a further aspect, the rotavirus particles prepared in accordance with the invention are used as a medicament. In one embodiment, the invention relates to an immunogenic composition comprising a rotavirus particle that comprises the chimeric surface protein of the invention. The invention further relates to a method of treating a patient in need thereof comprising administering to said patient the rotavirus particle of the invention, e.g. in form of an immunogenic composition of the invention.
      The underlying concept of the invention can be extended to other (trimeric or non-trimeric) heterologous proteins and other viruses (in particular reoviruses) or assemblies (e.g. virus-like particles, ferritin cages, etc.) by adapting the methods described herein.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2651483,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Over the past decade, protein A affinity chromatography has become well established as the primary method of choice for the capture of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from mammalian cell culture feed streams. This highly specific affinity step is able to remove 98% of impurities in a single step due to the specific binding between the protein A ligand and the Fc-region of the antibody. Under typical operating conditions in protein A chromatography, clarified cell culture feed streams are applied to the column until a certain load mass of antibody is achieved. The column is then typically washed with a high ionic strength buffer to remove host cell contaminants bound to the resin through nonspecific interactions. The antibody is then normally eluted from the column by a shift in pH and collected for further processing. The primary objective of this work is therefore to investigate the use of detergents combined with salts to disrupt both ionic and hydrophobic interactions and enhance removal of host cell contaminants, thereby reducing the purification burden on downstream unit operations.
      For large-scale purification much effort is placed on optimizing the components of wash and elution buffers to maximize product yield. However, in a production situation where many different protein products are being purified at the same time, developing a unique wash buffer for each individual protein product requires significant time and resources to screen various buffer components to determine an appropriate wash buffer for each particular protein product. A “generic” intermediate wash buffer that could be used effectively with different types of proteins would be useful and desirable. The present invention provides a method of protein purification using such wash buffer components.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2698654,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Proteins are important in biopharmaceuticals as they are widely used to cure a number of diseases including diabetes (e.g. Insulin), cancers (e.g. Interferon, monoclonal antibodies), heart attacks, strokes, cystic fibrosis (e.g. Enzymes, Blood factors), inflammation diseases (e.g. Tumor Necrosis Factors), anemia (e.g. Erythropoietin), hemophilia (e.g. Blood clotting factors), etc. One of the important challenges is the development of efficient and competent process for the large scale purification of these proteins. Numerous processes are available for the large scale purification of the Protein-of-interest from the harvest cell culture fluid (HCCF), but still some impurities remain with the purified Protein-of-interest which can prove to be detrimental to the long term stability as well as quality of the Protein-of-interest. The Protein-of-interest is purified from the HCCF using a series of chromatographic and Ultrafiltration/Dia-filtration techniques.
      Although a lot of processes have been developed to purify TNFR:Fc fusion proteins from the HCCF, but due to variability in the cell expression system, it has been observed that general purification processes often fail to adequately purify the Protein-of-interest from the process related impurities. The Protein-of-interest produced by the host cells during cell culture or fermentation has to be purified from host cell-derived proteins (HCP), host-cell DNA, process additives, adventitious agents, toxins and certain product-related substances. These impurities are undesirable in the purified Protein-of-interest and their levels need to be kept within the acceptable levels to render the product safe for human therapeutic use (Wang et. al. 2009 Jun. 15 Biotechnol Bioengineering 103(3):446-58).
      Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a potent cytokine and elicits a broad spectrum of biologic responses, which are mediated by binding to a cell surface receptor. It is involved in pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, SLE, Crohn's disease etc. Hohmann et. al. (Hohmann et. al. 1989 J Biol Chem. 25, 14927-34). Direct inhibition of TNF-alpha by the biological agents has produced significant advances in rheumatoid arthritis treatment and has validated the extra-cellular inhibition of this pro-inflammatory cytokine as an effective therapy. Recombinant TNFR:Fc fusion proteins bind to the cytokine TNF and block the activity of TNF. Examples of TNF-inhibitors include TNFR:Fc fusion protein (Etanercept) and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (Adalimumab, Infliximab, Golimumab and Certolizumabpegol).
      Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of an extra-cellular ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilo Dalton (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR, type II) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. The Fc component of Etanercept consists of the CH 2 domain, the CH 3 domain and hinge region, whereas the CH 1 domain is absent (U.S. Pat. No. 7,648,702). It is produced through recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary mammalian cells. It consists of 934 amino acids, and has an apparent molecular weight of approximately 130 kilo Dalton. Due to its unique structure, Etanercept binds more efficiently to TNF alpha than its endogenous receptor (Gofeeet et. al. 2003 J Am Acad Dermatol. 49, S105-111, Strober 2005 Semin Cutan Med Surg. 24; 28-36).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2262510,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       The interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) family of proteins has proven to be useful in treatment of a variety of diseases. For example, interferons alpha 2a and 2b (trade names Roferon and Intron A, respectively) have been used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, C and D (life-threatening viral diseases of the liver), condylomata acuminata (genital warts), AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, hairy cell leukemia, malignant melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma, renal cell carcinoma, herpes I and II, varicella/herpes zoster, and mycosis fungoides. The efficacy of treatment regimes containing interferon-alpha prostate cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia have also been studied.
       The human interferon-alpha family is the largest and most complex family of interferons. Members of the interferon-alpha family have similar amino acid sequences that define them as a group distinct from other interferons; i.e., these proteins typically have at least 35% amino acid identity in a typical protein sequence alignment. The SwissProt database contains numerous human interferon-alpha proteins, including the alternatively named interferon-delta and interferon-omega proteins. These proteins typically are synthesized with a leader sequence of about 23 amino acids, and the mature proteins typically have a molecular weight of about 19 kD. Because these proteins are so similar, when interferon-alpha is obtained from a human or other mammalian source and extensively purified, a mixture of isospecies with varying biological activities often are obtained [Georgiadis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,683]. Similarly, the cDNAs encoding these proteins have sufficiently similar sizes and properties that a single set of procedures can be used to manipulate them for purposes of plasmid construction. Accordingly, it would be useful to have a method for efficiently producing and purifying a single species of interferon-alpha from a mammalian source.
       Because of its relatively small size of about 19 kD (Lawn et al. (1981) PROC. NATL. ACAD. SCI. U.S.A. 78: 5435), interferon-alpha can be filtered by the kidney. However, when filtered, interferon-alpha typically is absorbed and metabolized by kidney tubular cells and, therefore, usually is not excreted. According to current clinical practice, formulated interferon-alpha is administered by intramuscular injection, after which its levels in serum decline with a half-life of about 5 hours for interferon-alpha 2a and 2-3 hours for interferon-alpha 2b (PHYSICIANS DESK REFERENCE, 50th edition, 1996: 2145-2147 and 2364-2373).
       Furthermore, because of their small size, multiple, frequent injections of interferon-alpha are required (usually daily or 3 times/week), and there can be significant variation in the level of interferon-alpha in the patient. In addition, the injected doses are large, ranging from about 50 micrograms per dose for hairy cell leukemia to 300 micrograms per dose for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. High levels of circulating interferon-alpha can result in significant side effects, including skin, neurologic, immune and endocrine toxicities. It is thought that the small size of interferon-alpha allows it to pass through the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system, accounting for some of the neurologic side effects. Accordingly, it would be useful to increase the potency and effective serum half-life in patients being treated with interferon-alpha while at the same time minimizing side effects.
       Given the high dosage, low efficacy, short serum half-life, difficulties in purification, and side effects of interferon-alpha, there is a need in the art for methods of enhancing the production and improving the pharmacological properties of this therapeutic agent.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       The present invention features methods and compositions useful for making and using fusion proteins containing interferon-alpha. In particular, the invention features nucleic acids, for example, DNA or RNA sequences, encoding an immunoglobulin Fc-interferon-alpha fusion protein, and methods for expressing the nucleic acid to produce such fusion proteins. The fusion proteins can facilitate high level expression of biologically active interferon-alpha. The fusion protein can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prior to administration to a mammal, for example, a human. Under certain circumstances, the interferon-alpha can be cleaved from the fusion protein prior to formulation and/or administration. Alternatively, nucleic acid sequences encoding the interferon-alpha containing fusion protein can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and administered to the mammal.
       It is an object of the invention to provide novel nucleic acid sequences, for example, DNAs and RNAs, which facilitate the production and secretion of interferon-alpha. In particular, the invention provides (i) nucleic acid sequences which facilitate efficient production and secretion of interferon-alpha; (ii) nucleic acid constructs for the rapid and efficient production and secretion of interferon-alpha in a variety of mammalian host cells; and (iii) methods for the production, secretion and collection of recombinant interferon-alpha or genetically engineered variants thereof, including non-native, biosynthetic, or otherwise artificial interferon-alpha proteins such as proteins which have been created by rational design.
       Other objects of the invention are to provide polynucleotide sequences which, when fused to a polynucleotide encoding interferon-alpha, encode an interferon-alpha containing fusion polypeptide which can be purified using common reagents and techniques. Yet another object is to interpose a proteolytic cleavage site between a secretion cassette and the encoded interferon-alpha protein such that the secretion cassette can be cleaved from the interferon-alpha domain so that interferon-alpha may be purified independently.
       Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention provides nucleic acid molecules, for example, DNA or RNA molecules, which encode an immunoglobulin Fc region-interferon-alpha fusion protein. The nucleic acid molecule encodes serially in a 5′ to 3′ direction, a signal sequence, an immunoglobulin Fc region, and at least one target protein, wherein the target protein comprises interferon-alpha.
       In a preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin Fc region comprises an immunoglobulin hinge region and preferably comprises at least one immunoglobulin constant heavy region domain, for example, an immunoglobulin constant heavy 2 (CH2) domain, an immunoglobulin constant heavy 3 (CH3) domain, and depending upon the type of immunoglobulin used to generate the Fc region, optionally an immunoglobulin constant heavy chain 4 (CH4) domain. In a more preferred embodiment, the immunoglobulin Fe region lacks at least an immunoglobulin constant heavy 1 (CH 1) domain. Although the immunoglobulin Fc regions may be based on any immunoglobulin class, for example, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, immunoglobulin Fc regions based on IgG are preferred.
       The nucleic acid of the invention can be incorporated in operative association into a replicable expression vector which can then be introduced into a mammalian host cell competent to produce the interferon-alpha-based fusion protein. The resultant interferon-alpha-based fusion protein is produced efficiently and secreted from the mammalian host cell. The secreted interferon-alpha-based fusion protein may be collected from the culture media without lysing the mammalian host cell. The protein product can be assayed for activity and/or purified using common reagents as desired, and/or cleaved from the fusion partner, all using conventional techniques.
       In another aspect, the invention provides fusion proteins containing interferon-alpha. The fusion proteins of the present invention demonstrate improved biological properties over native interferon-alpha such as increased solubility, prolonged serum half-life and increased binding to its receptor. These properties may improve significantly the clinical efficacy of interferon-alpha. In a preferred embodiment, the fusion protein comprises, in an N- to C- terminal direction, an immunoglobulin Fc region and interferon-alpha, with other moieties, for example, a proteolytic cleavage site, optionally interposed between the immunoglobulin Fc region and the interferon-alpha. The resulting fusion protein preferably is synthesized in a cell that glycosylates the Fc region at normal glycosylation sites, i.e., which usually exist in template antibodies.
       In another embodiment, the fusion protein may comprise a second target protein, for example, mature, full length interferon-alpha or a bioactive fragment thereof. In this type of construct the first and second target proteins can be the same or different proteins. The first and second target proteins may be linked together, either directly or by means of a polypeptide linker. Alternatively, both target proteins may be linked either directly or via a polypeptide linker, to the immunoglobulin Fc region. In the latter case, the first target protein can be connected to an N-terminal end of the immunoglobulin Fc region and the second target protein can be connected to a C-terminal end of the immunoglobulin Fc region.
       In another embodiment, two fusion proteins may associate, either covalently, for example, by a disulfide bond, a polypeptide bond or a crosslinking agent, or non-covalently, to produce a dimeric protein. In a preferred embodiment, the two fusion proteins are associated covalently by means of at least one and more preferably two interchain disulfide bonds via cysteine residues, preferably located within immunoglobulin hinge regions disposed within the immunoglobulin Fc regions of each chain.
       Other objects of the invention are to provide multivalent and multimeric forms of interferon-alpha fusion proteins and combinations thereof.
       In another aspect, the invention provides methods of producing a fusion protein comprising an immunoglobulin Fc region and the target protein. The method comprises the steps of (a) providing a mammalian cell containing a DNA molecule encoding such a fusion protein, either with or without a signal sequence, and (b) culturing the mammalian cell to produce the fusion protein. The resulting fusion protein can then be harvested, refolded, if necessary, and purified using conventional purification techniques well known and used in the art. Assuming that the fusion protein comprises a proteolytic cleavage site disposed between the immunoglobulin Fc region and the target protein, the target can be cleaved from the fusion protein using conventional proteolytic enzymes and if necessary, purified prior to use.
       In yet another aspect, the invention provides methods for treating conditions alleviated by interferon-alpha or active variants thereof by administering to a mammal an effective amount of interferon-alpha produced by a method of the invention and/or a fusion construct of the invention. The invention also provides methods for treating conditions alleviated by interferon-alpha or active variants thereof by administering a nucleic acid of the invention, for example, a “naked DNA,” or a vector containing a DNA or RNA of the invention, to a mammal having the condition.
       In a preferred embodiment, the constructs of the invention can be used in the treatment of a liver disorder, wherein the interferon-alpha by virtue of the immunoglobulin Fc region becomes localized within the liver. The constructs of the invention may be particularly useful in the treatment of liver disorders which include, but are not limited to, viral diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C or hepatitis D, liver cancer as well as other types of cancer involving metastases located in the liver.
       The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description, drawings, and claims that follow.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2688832,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Within the zone surrounding a plant's roots is a region called the rhizosphere. In the rhizosphere, bacteria, fungi, and other organisms compete for nutrients and for binding to the root structures of the plant. Both detrimental and beneficial bacteria and fungi can occupy the rhizosphere. The bacteria, fungi, and the root system of the plant can all be influenced by the actions of peptides, enzymes, and other proteins in the rhizosphere. Augmentation of soil or treatment of plants with certain of these peptides, enzymes, or other proteins would have beneficial effects on the overall populations of beneficial soil bacteria and fungi, create a healthier overall soil environment for plant growth, improve plant growth, and provide for the protection of plants against certain bacterial and fungal pathogens. However, previous attempts to introduce peptides, enzymes, and other proteins into soil to induce such beneficial effects on plants have been hampered by the low survival of enzymes, proteins, and peptides in soil. Additionally, the prevalence of proteases naturally present in the soil leads to degradation of the proteins in the soil. The environment around the roots of a plant (the rhizosphere) is a unique mixture of bacteria, fungi, nutrients, and roots that has different qualities than that of native soil. The symbiotic relationship between these organisms is unique, and could be altered for the better with inclusion of exogenous proteins. The high concentration of fungi and bacteria in the rhizosphere causes even greater degradation of proteins due to abnormally high levels of proteases and other elements detrimental to proteins in the soil. In addition, enzymes and other proteins introduced into soil can dissipate away from plant roots quickly.
      Thus, there exists a need in the art for a method for effectively delivering peptides, enzymes, and other proteins to plants (e.g., to plant root systems) and for extending the period of time during which such molecules remain active. Furthermore, there exists a need in the art for a method of selectively targeting such peptides, enzymes, and proteins to the rhizosphere and to plant leaves and plant roots in particular.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2670166,"BACKGROUND ART
      Etanercept is a biological inflammation modulator that functions as a competitive inhibitor of TNF-α, binding to cell surface TNF-α receptor, to inhibit TNF-α mediated immune responses. Etanercept is a macromolecule with a molecular weight of 150 kDa, and is a homodimer of two fusion proteins linked by disulfide bond, and each fusion protein consisting of a human soluble p75 TNF (tumor necrosis factor) receptor coupled to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G subclass 1 (Goldenberg, Clinical Therapeutics, 21(1): 75-87, 1999; Moreland et al., Ann. Intern. Med., 130(6): 478-486, 1999).
      The typical form of such fusion protein was first synthesized in the early 1990s by Bruce A. Beutler et al., at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and marketed by Amgen under the trade name of Enbrel® in 2002. Etanercept is a TNF-α inhibitor used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis, and is under clinical trials for the treatment of vasculitis, Alzheimer's disease, and Crohn's disease.
      The TNFR-Fc fusion protein can be prepared by fusing 235 amino acids of TNFR and 232 amino acids of Fc region, and when producing gene recombination technology, it exists in the form of a dimer and exhibits biological activity. TNFR is divided into 4 domains and a transmembrane region, and among the 235 amino acids consisting the same, the number of cysteine is 22, and such cysteine all forms disulfide bonds to form a three-dimensional structure. However, when TNFR-Fc is produced from animal cells, cysteines bind with each other at random, and thus they do not form disulfide bonds identical to those of a native protein. TNFR may be also partially truncated, and fail to form a correct TNFR-Fc dimer. TNFR-Fc with incorrect disulfide bonds cannot show the proper biological activity due to a drastic reduction in the binding ability to TNF-α. Further, when the entirety or a part of TNFR is truncated, it may also not exhibit such biological activity.
      Therefore, when the TNFR-Fc dimers are produced using a recombinant DNA technology and an animal cell culture technique, active proteins, inactive proteins with incorrect disulfide bonds, aggregates, and truncated forms are produced at the same time, and thus a technique for isolating and purifying the proteins is needed.
      Further, according to U.S. Pat. No. 7,294,481, whose applicant is Immunex Corporation, the developer of etanercept, and which relates to a method for producing recombinant proteins, it was confirmed that three peaks are present by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), and it was confirmed that the peaks are sequentially constituted of etanercept of various forms having a very low biological activity comprising etanercept in the truncated form at positions S186 and D235, TNFR-Fc fusion protein in an active form and aggregate, disulfide scrambled TNFR-Fc, etc. The same peak pattern is also disclosed in Korean patent No. 10-1454316, which relates to a method for preparing an active form of TNFR-Fc fusion protein by using a method for producing a recombinant protein. Meanwhile, hydrophobic interaction chromatography conventionally used for isolating TNFR-Fc fusion protein is merely designed to obtain high purity of an active form of TNFR-Fc fusion protein by removing and minimizing impurities except active forms of TNFR-Fc fusion protein, such as aggregates, disulfide-scrambled TNFR-Fc fusion protein, and truncated forms of TNFR-Fc fusion protein.
      Meanwhile, a biosimilar is a material which is equivalent to existing approved products in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy, and specifically, only when it has a constitution similar to an originator product thereof in terms of ingredients and content of impurities, it can be used as a biomedical product. For example, etanercept (Pfizer) contains approximately 9% to 18% of the ingredient having low bioactivity which is disclosed as a component of hydrophobic interaction chromatography peak 3 (hereinafter, “peak 3”) in the conventional art, and which may have influence on pharmacology as well as potency. Accordingly, developing a biosimilar product requires adjusting the content of peak 3 to a level similar to that of the originator product. Although there is a method for purifying a sample including TNFR-Fc prepared using HIC by a conventional method for producing recombinant proteins (Korean patent No. 10-1454316), the method is merely designed to obtain high purity of a peak 2 ingredient, which is an active form of TNFR-Fc after removing impurities. There has been no trial for adjusting the content of peak 3, which is a type of impurity having low bioactivity, to a level similar to that of an originator product.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Technical Problem
      The present inventors have made efforts to develop a method for preparing TNFR-Fc fusion protein containing a specific content of peak 3 through adjustment in producing TNFR-Fc fusion protein using hydrophobic interaction chromatography. As a result, they confirmed that TNFR-Fc fusion protein whose peak 3 content is adjusted to a level similar to conventional originator products can be produced by pre-equilibrating a hydrophobic interaction chromatograph (HIC) medium containing an aromatic functional group with an equilibration buffer comprising a predetermined concentration of sodium chloride, and loading and eluting a sample, thereby completing the present invention.
Technical Solution
      An object of the present invention is to provide a method for preparing a TNFR-Fc fusion protein mixture containing a target content of hydrophobic chromatogram peak 3, and a method for adjusting a content of hydrophobic chromatogram peak 3.
Advantageous Effects
      The present invention provides a method for producing a TNFR-Fc fusion protein by using hydrophobic interaction chromatography, wherein a target content of hydrophobic chromatogram peak 3 is included by adjusting a content of hydrophobic chromatogram peak 3 by conducting hydrophobic interaction chromatography through equilibration with an equilibration buffer comprising a predetermined concentration of sodium chloride or ammonium sulfate. Accordingly, the disclosed method can be instrumentally applied for preparation of biomedical products comprising recombinant proteins such as etanercept which is produced by genetic recombination technique from animal cell culture.

2689717,"BACKGROUND
      Interleukin 15 (IL-15), discovered by Grabstein et al. in 1994, is a cytokine of about 12-14 kD, which plays a role in the normal immune response in organisms, such as promoting the proliferation of T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells.
      IL-15 is a member of the small four α-helix bundle family of cytokines. IL-15 needs to bind with its receptor to exert its biological activity. IL-15 receptor consists of three receptor subunits: IL-15 receptor α (IL-15Rα), IL-2 receptor β (IL-2Rβ, also known as IL-15Rβ or CD122) and γc (also known as CD132). IL-15Rα contains a Sushi domain which is capable of binding with IL-15, and is essential for biological functions of IL-15 after binding.
      Recently, it was found that the complex formed by IL-15 and its receptor IL-15Rα can significantly enhance the biological activity of IL-15. Studies indicated that the complex formed by IL-15 and soluble IL-15Rα receptor is significantly superior to IL-15 alone in stimulating the proliferation of memory CD8+ T lymphocytes and NT/NKT cells. IL-15/IL-15Rα complex is more than 10 times stronger than IL-15 alone in stimulating proliferation of memory CD8+ T cells and in maintaining their survival. The mechanism may be related to cis presentation.
      Since it has been demonstrated that IL-15 is expected to be useful in the field of tumor immunotherapy, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) first began investigating IL-15 treatment in the tumor area, and tried to push it into Phase I clinicals. However, IL-15 has the disadvantages of small molecular weight, short in vivo half-life, hardly-controlled repeated dosage, and is likely to cause systemic immune side effects. There is an urgent need to find an approach which can increase the in vivo half-life, and promote or enhance the biological activity of IL-15 in vivo. There are many domestic and foreign companies or research institutions engaging in research related to IL-15 immunotherapy. For example, Chinese Patent CN100334112C (Shanghai Haixin Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) relates to IL-15-hIgG4Fc homodimeric protein in anti-microbial infection treatment; Chines Patent Application CN1942481A (Switzerland F. Hoffmann-LaRoche AG) relates to IL-15-Fc fusion expression system and its use; and Chinese Patent CN101360827B (French Institute of Health and Medical Research) relates to IL-15Rα (sushi+domain)-IL-15 fusion protein and its application in cancer treatment. Heterodimeric molecules of the present application show better stability, prolonged in vivo half-life and improved biological activity by increasing intramolecular interactions. On the basis of the molecular design in the present application, targeting immune cytokines can be generated by fusing and inserting functional polypeptides via methods well known in the field. The present disclosure also relates to the application of targeting immune cytokines in cancer and autoimmune disease therapy.

      Tumor immunotherapy is a hotspot of cancer therapy, which is considered the fourth cancer treatment modality following surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The objective of tumor immunology therapy is to initiate or mobilize the body's immune system, enhance anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment, and consequently control and kill tumor cells. It may be the most effective and safest approach for cancer treatment.
      The mechanism underlying tumor immune escape is based on the inhibitory effect of the tumor per se on the immune system to maintain or promote tumor growth. Tumor immunotherapy is to ultimately enhance the patient's own immune system response to the tumor. It not only needs to activate the existing immune system response in vivo, but it also needs to maintain the duration and intensity of the immune system response, which is the key of tumor immunotherapy.
      Cytokine immunotherapy is developed along with the production of highly pure or recombinant cytokines. The principle is that after injection into the body, certain cytokines can regulate and enhance one or more functions of immune cells, and play a stronger anti-tumor immunity.

The Fc region can be derived from different species, preferably human immunoglobulins. According to the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant region, immunoglobulins can be divided into different categories, mainly comprising five classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. Some of them can be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g. IgG-1, IgG-2, IgG-3, IgG-4; and IgA-1 and IgA-2.
      An “Fc region” preferably comprises at least one immunoglobulin hinge region, and CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG, and more preferably comprises a CH2 domain, a CH3 domain and an immunoglobulin hinge region of IgG1. The initial amino acid position of the hinge region can be varied.
      Mutation design in Fc variants has been widely applied in the art for preparing bispecific antibodies or heterologous dimeric Fc fusion proteins. Representative examples comprise the “Knob-into-Hole” form proposed by Cater et al.

The Knob/Hole structure on the Fc variant of the present invention refers to two Fc fragments respectively mutated, and then bound in the form of “Knob-into-Hole”. Preferably, the “knob-into-hole” model proposed by Cater et al. is used to perform site mutations in the Fc region, so that the resulting first Fc variant and second Fc variant are able to be bound together in the form of “knob-into-hole” to form a heterodimer. It is within the scope of those skilled in the art to select a specific immunoglobulin Fc region from particular immunoglobulin classes and subclasses. Preferably, the Fc region of human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 antibodies is selected, and more preferably the Fc region of human IgG1 antibody is selected. One of the first Fc variant and the second Fc variant is randomly selected for the knob mutation, and the other for hole mutation. In one embodiment, the first Fc variant is mutated to the knob mutation, such as the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 26; and the second Fc variant is mutated to the hole mutation, such as the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 27.
      The term “linker peptide (Linker)” in the present invention is a peptide used to connect IL-15 or IL-15Rα with an Fc variant, in order to ensure the correct protein folding and stability. “Linker peptide” of the present invention is preferably (GGGGS) n, where n can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more, and preferably n is 2 to 4. If the sequence of the linker peptide is too short, the advanced structural folding of the two proteins may be affected, and thus interfere with each other. If the sequence of the linker peptide is too long, the problem of immunogenicity is a concern, since the linker peptide sequence itself is a new antigen.
      As used herein, “heterodimeric protein” is preferably a product of co-expressed genes, for example, co-expressed in prokaryotic cells such as E. coli, or co-expressed in eukaryotic cells, such as 293 and CHO cells.
      As used herein, “coexpression” refers to the expression of multiple genes together in a cell to simultaneously generate their products. These genes can exist simultaneously, and be separately or commonly controlled and expressed. In the present invention, two genes are preferably co-expressed in a eukaryotic cell.

      As used herein, “Immunoglobulin” refers to a four-peptide chain structure connected together by disulfide bond(s) between two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Different immunoglobulin heavy chain constant regions exhibit different amino acid compositions and rank orders, hence present different kinds of antigenicity. Accordingly, immunoglobulins can be divided into five categories, also called immunoglobulin isotypes, namely IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE. According to the amino acid composition of the hinge region and the number and location of heavy chain disulfide bonds, the same type of Ig can be divided into different subcategories, for example, IgG can be divided into IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. The light chain can be divided into κ or λ chain according to different constant regions.
      “Targeting protein molecule” refers to a class of proteins, which contains a fragment or a region capable of interacting with other proteins and introducing targeting peptides, such as antibody fragments, ScFv fragments or binding peptides of some classes of cell surface molecules and the like on the basis of immune cytokines, such as IL5, IL2, etc., or unique molecular design containing such cytokines, such as the molecular design in this application. For example, the interaction between an antibody and antigen, or the interaction between a ligand and receptor, makes molecules preferentially enriched in a particular tissue, organ or body part after entering into the body through its targeting effect to exert their biological functions. A new molecule is formed by fusing a free terminus of a molecule according to the present application with some class of polypeptide. The method used herein can reasonably be derived and designed to generate a series of molecules in the art.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2684619,"BACKGROUND ART
      Proteins are large biological molecules made up of one or several linear chains of amino acid residues. Enzymes are a specific group of proteins which serve as biological catalysts in the metabolism of all living cells. As such, enzymes are able to transform organic molecules into different molecules. Because of the specific three-dimensional structure of each particular enzyme, only very few organic molecules will interact with the enzyme's active site in such a way that transformation can take place. Enzymes are therefore usually highly selective catalysts, and the use of enzymes as catalysts in synthetic organic chemistry is for that reason very appealing. However, since enzymes are biological molecules evolved for a cell environment, they are often unsuited for other environments. When used in organic solvents, enzymes tend to aggregate and often unfold (i.e., denature). It is therefore attractive to immobilize enzymes on solid support and to use them as catalysts in this immobilized state, as this may improve the stability of the enzyme, allow for reaction conditions which the enzyme normally would not tolerate and furthermore facilitate the separation from the reaction mixture and recovery of the material.
      Immobilization of enzymes on solid support has been accomplished using different techniques and different solid supports (Tischer and Wedekind, “Immobilized Enzymes: Methods and Applications”, Topics in Current Chemistry, 1999, vol. 200, pp. 95-126; Brena and Batista-Viera, “Immobilization of Enzymes: A Literature Survey”, Methods in Biotechnology: Immobilization of Enzymes and Cells, 2006, second edition, pp. 15-30).
      Adsorption of enzymes to solid surfaces can lead to undesired interactions between the enzyme and the solid support. It has been shown that protein adsorption onto silica nanoparticles may lead to changes in the secondary structure of the protein, which can result in deactivation of the enzyme (Lundqvist et al., Langmuir 2004, vol. 20, pp. 10639-10647). It is therefore important that the solid support does not interfere with the structure and the activity of the immobilized enzymes.
      Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) is a technique for purification of proteins which is based on the affinity of proteins for metal ions such as Fe 2+, Cu 2+, Zn 2+, Ni 2+ and Co 2+. The metal ions are immobilized on an agarose gel and can selectively adsorb histidine- and cysteine-containing proteins (Porath et al., Nature 1975, vol. 258, pp. 598-599). An improved version of this technique uses recombinant proteins containing a fused polyhistidine peptide. As the polyhistidine peptide has a much higher affinity for the immobilized metal ions than a single histidine residue, the level of purification that can be achieved is much higher (Hochuli et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 1988, vol. 6, pp. 1321-1325; Ljungquist et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 1989, vol. 186, pp. 563-569). Although this technique can be successfully applied in chromatographic procedures for purification and isolation of proteins, the gel-immobilized enzymes are less suitable as heterogeneous catalysts in organic synthesis. The IMAC technique is furthermore primarily restricted to aqueous conditions.
      In attempts to prepare heterogeneous catalysts, the IMAC-based principle of affinity tag binding has been applied to the immobilization of polyhistidine-tagged enzymes on modified silica (Cassimjee et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2008, vol. 99, pp. 712-716; Cassimjee et al., Biotechnol. J. 2011, vol. 6, pp. 463-469). This worked well for Candida antarctica lipase B (CalB), but other, less stable enzymes were found to be deactivated in the presence of silica, especially in the presence of organic solvents. It is known in the literature that silica nanoparticles have a destabilizing effect on proteins (Lundqvist et al., Langmuir 2004, vol. 20, pp. 10639-10647).
      Controlled porosity glass (CPG) is another material that has been used for the immobilization of enzymes. The CPG is usually treated with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and the enzymes are thereafter allowed to bind to the aminopropyl-CPG through lysine residues present on the enzymes' surface, using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent. This results in a nonspecific binding of the enzyme to the CPG, often with concomitant loss of the enzymatic activity. A further drawback of this method is that the enzyme to be immobilized must be purified from other enzymes prior to the immobilization step, in order to avoid the immobilization of a mixture of different enzymes on the CPG.
      The immobilization of enzymes on CPG using organotitanates (U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,904) or using polysaccharide layers and 1,1′-dicarbonyldiimidazole (Rogalski et al., J. Mol. Catal. B: Enzym. 1999, vol. 6, pp. 29-39) has also been disclosed.
      Engstrom et al. (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2013, vol. 52, pp. 14006-14010) disclose a hybrid catalyst in which Candida antarctica lipase B and a nanopalladium species are co-immobilized into the compartments of mesoporous silica.
      The use of enzymes as catalysts in chemical industry, i.e. biocatalysis, is key to achieving higher sustainability, less toxic waste and higher cost efficiency. However, the high costs of enzymes and the frequently observed loss of activity upon immobilization of the enzyme on solid support are obstacles in this development. A standardized and generally workable procedure for enzyme immobilization, which would allow the enzyme to be re-used, would be highly desirable. Despite progress made in recent years, there still is no general and simple method for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts by immobilization of enzymes. There is therefore a continued need for improved methods for the immobilization of enzymes on a solid support, and for stable heterogeneous biocatalysts which can be applied in organic synthesis under both aqueous and organic reactions conditions.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
      It has surprisingly been discovered that by immobilizing proteins on a porous glass material or a porous organic polymer through affinity tag binding, an immobilized protein material is obtained having improved properties with respect to stability of the immobilized proteins, and wherein the biological function of the proteins is maintained. Preparations of immobilized enzymes were found to have a high catalytic activity, which makes them useful in biocatalysis.
      According to the invention, a protein containing an affinity tag is immobilized by being bound to a specific group on an affinity matrix attached to the porous glass material or the porous organic polymer. Because of the high binding affinity of the affinity tag for the specific group on the matrix, the binding of the protein to the matrix is both strong and highly specific. The invention thus provides general methods for the purification and immobilization of proteins, such as enzymes.
      In a first aspect, the invention relates to an immobilized protein material comprising a carrier and at least one protein immobilized on the carrier, wherein the carrier comprises a carrier material to which an affinity matrix is attached, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
      (a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
      (b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
      (c) a porous organic polymer;
      and wherein the at least one protein contains an affinity tag and is immobilized on the carrier through specific affinity binding to the affinity matrix.
      The immobilization of proteins on the carrier via an affinity tag offers the advantage of a specific binding of the proteins on a predefined site. At the same time, however, the immobilization method is generally applicable to many different proteins. The affinity tag that is used in the invention may be any tag that is able to specifically bind to a matrix for which it has affinity. The affinity binding may be the result of, e.g., van der Waals' interaction, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding or hydrophobic interaction. In any case, the affinity binding should be strong enough to allow the affinity tag and the matrix to remain tightly bonded to each other at least until certain specific conditions are applied in order to dissociate the affinity tag from the matrix.
      In another aspect, the invention relates to a carrier for the immobilization of proteins, comprising a carrier material to which an affinity matrix is attached, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
      (a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
      (b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
      (c) a porous organic polymer;
      and wherein the proteins are immobilized on the carrier through specific affinity binding to the affinity matrix.
      The protein to be immobilized on the carrier may be any protein containing an affinity tag, such as a (recombinant) protein or enzyme containing an affinity tag. Preferably, the protein is an enzyme containing an affinity tag. It is to be understood that the tag should have specific affinity for the affinity matrix attached to the carrier.
      A number of affinity tags and corresponding matrices are known in the art. Examples of affinity tags that may be useful in the invention, and the corresponding groups on the matrix, are listed in the table below:
  Affinity tag Corresponding groups on matrix
  polyhistidine tag chelated metal ions, e.g. Fe2+, Fe3+,
  Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+
glutathione S-transferase (GST) glutathione
chitin binding protein (CBP) chitin
maltose binding protein (MBP) cross-linked amylose
FLAG-tag Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody
avidin biotin
streptavidin biotin
        In a preferred embodiment, the affinity tag on the protein is a polyhistidine tag and the affinity matrix attached to the carrier contains a chelated metal ion. The chelated metal ion is preferably a metal ion selected from the group consisting of Fe 2+, Fe 3+, Co 2+, Ni 2+, Cu 2+ and Zn 2+, and is more preferably selected from the group consisting of Fe 3+, Ni 2+ and Co 2+. In a preferred embodiment, the chelated metal ion is Co 2+. In another preferred embodiment, the chelated metal ion is Fe 3+.
      The choice of the chelated metal ion may be dependent on the intended use. For instance, if the carrier is to be used for the purification and isolation of an affinity tagged protein, the binding of the enzyme to the carrier should be reversible. In such cases, it is preferred that the chelated metal ion is Ni 2+ or Co 2+, and most preferably Co 2+. These metal ions bind strong enough for immobilizing a polyhistidine-tagged enzyme, but are also capable of releasing the immobilized enzyme when specific conditions are applied, such as treatment with a buffered solution containing imidazole or ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA).
      For the use of immobilized enzymes in heterogeneous biocatalysis, a strong binding of the enzyme to the carrier is desirable. In such cases, it is preferred that the chelated metal ion is Co 2+ or Fe 3+, and most preferably Fe 3+, since this results in particularly strong binding of the polyhistidine tag to the carrier. As is demonstrated in the examples, leaching of either enzyme or metal ion from immobilized protein material comprising Fe 3+ as the chelated metal ion is almost negligible. The absence of leaching allows the immobilized protein material (the biocatalyst) to be used in catalytic amounts. The use of catalytic amounts is particularly important in continuous flow reactions.
      A further advantage of Fe 3+ as the chelated metal ion is that this metal is non-toxic. The resulting immobilized protein material may therefore be safely applied e.g. in the food industry.
      The matrix for the affinity-tagged protein is attached to the surface of the carrier through an appropriate linker. The surface of controlled porosity glass (CPG) contains free silanol (Si—OH) groups, which can be attached to a linker molecule via a covalent bond. Typically, the surface is reacted with a bifunctional alkyl silane linker molecule (the chain length and structure of which may vary), whereby the silicon atom is covalently bonded with the glass surface silanol groups and wherein the terminal group of the silane is a functional group, such as an aldehyde, an amine, an epoxy group, a halide, or a carboxylic acid derivative. The appropriate functional group that should be used will depend on the nature of the matrix to be attached to the surface of theCPG. Methods for attaching the matrix to the surface of the CPG through an appropriate linker are known to the skilled in the art.
      CPG is a robust and inert glass material that can be produced as particles of size-controlled macro- or meso-pores. The sharp pore size distribution of CPG can be varied for pore sizes of about 10 to 300 nm diameters. This provides a favorable microenvironment without complications due to steric hindrance. The interconnecting pore structure results in low solution flow resistance and facilitates the mass transfer of reactants and products throughout the material. The rigid structure of CPG provides a rugged, noncompressible medium suitable for high throughput reactor designs and linear scale up at high flow rates.
      The material displays limited swelling in solvents and is chemically and dimensionally stable in most organic media and aqueous environments at pH below 10.
      Conventional CPG exhibits a ligand loading capacity that is inversely related to its pore size. Thus, a CPG support of a large pore size cannot be loaded with as much protein as a CPG support of a smaller pore size. This is partially due to the inverse relationship between pore size and surface area, and partially due to surface accessible silanol groups serving as functionalization moieties having a defined density per unit of surface area, approximately 4.5 μmol/m 2. Conventional CPG displays a non-uniform silanol distribution where sterically hindered silanol sites may not serve as functional attachment points.
      Hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG, or HybCPG) is a variant of CPG wherein the interior and exterior surfaces of the CPG are coated with an approximately 10 nm film of a crosslinked organic polymer, as is described in WO 2009/005631. The polymeric coating on the Hybrid CPG may contain functional groups, such as aldehydes, amino groups, epoxy groups, halides, carboxylic acids and esters, or mixtures thereof, to which a matrix can be attached. Methods for attaching a matrix to an appropriate functional group are known to those skilled in the art.
      Hybrid CPG offers certain advantages over conventional CPG. As a result of the polymer coating, the dependence between loading and pore size can be minimized and the spacing between functionalization sites can be more accurately and uniformly controlled. Hybrid CPG as carrier material for protein immobilization may offer additional benefits, because the design of the polymer coating can be tailored in order to provide surface characteristics that are desired or required for a given application. For instance, a homogeneous polymer such as polystyrene will produce a more hydrophobic carrier surface, while a homogeneous polymer such as polyacrylonitrile will produce a more hydrophilic carrier surface. By using mixtures of two or more different polymers, a co-polymeric coating may be obtained wherein the characteristics of the carrier surface are specifically adapted for a given application. The thin layer coatings allow some degree of microscopic swelling in organic solvents, but without bulk expansion of the Hybrid CPG bed or an increase in back pressure. The coatings also allow the use of Hybrid CPG in aqueous environments above pH 10.
      Throughout the remainder of the description and the appended claims, any reference to CPG is to be interpreted as including both (conventional) CPG and Hybrid CPG, unless specifically indicated otherwise.
      Other carrier materials than CPG and HybCPG may be desired due to reasons such as higher cost efficiency or specific process requirements. Such materials include porous organic polymer (plastic) materials. These polymers are functionalized with functional groups such as aldehydes, amino groups, epoxy groups, halides, carboxylic acids or esters, or mixtures thereof, to which a matrix can be attached. Methods for attaching a matrix to an appropriate functional group are known to those skilled in the art. The functionalized plastics can be produced as porous particles with limited swelling. Suitable organic polymers may be based on monomers such as styrene, ethylene, propylene, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate. Examples of such organic polymers include functionalized polyethylene, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polystyrene, polymethacrylate and poly(methyl methacrylate). In a preferred embodiment, the porous organic polymer is functionalized polystyrene or functionalized polymethacrylate.
      The attachment of affinity tagged proteins to HybCPG described herein demonstrates the possibility of using porous organic polymer carriers, since the porous surface in HybCPG is an organic polymer per se. HybCPG largely maintains the incompressible and non-swelling nature of CPG while the surface properties of organic polymers can be utilized. When the rigidity of CPG is not needed it is plausible that the organic polymer alone is a better choice. The method of applying an affinity tag attachment to such materials is therefore demonstrated herein.
      CPG-immobilized protein material can easily be produced in only a few steps, starting from either amino-CPG or amino-HybCPG, as outlined in FIG. 1. For instance, the CPG materials can be treated with 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone, thereby linking the phenyl group to the CPG via an imine. If desired, the imine functionality can thereafter be reduced to the corresponding amine using an appropriate reducing agent, such as e.g. sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride or lithium aluminum hydride. A chelated metal ion, such as Co 2+ or Fe 3+, can subsequently be introduced by suspension of the material in an aqueous solution of CoCl 2 or FeCl 3, respectively. After drying, the obtained material can directly be used as a binding matrix for one or more polyhistidine-tagged proteins.
      An immobilized protein material wherein the carrier material is an organic polymer can be produced in a similar way as described above for CPG and HybCPG.
      The high affinity of the polyhistidine tag for metal ions such as Co 2+ or Fe 3+ allows the immobilization of polyhistidine-tagged proteins to be performed from crude solutions containing the proteins without the need for extensive purification of the solution prior to the immobilization step. Organic material that does not contain a polyhistidine tag will bind to the chelated metal ions only weakly, or not at all, and will be easily removed from the final immobilized proteins material by washing with e.g. water or buffered aqueous solutions. Thus, if the polyhistidine-tagged protein is prepared by intracellular overexpression, the protein immobilization may be performed directly from the cell lysate. Alternatively, if the polyhistidine-tagged protein is secreted by the host organism, the protein immobilization may be performed directly from the cell culture supernatant.
      Thus, in another aspect, the invention relates to a method for the immobilization of an affinity tagged protein, comprising the steps of
  i) immobilizing the affinity-tagged protein on a carrier comprising a carrier material to which an affinity matrix is attached, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
(a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
(b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
(c) porous organic polymers; and
ii) optionally washing the immobilized protein material with water or an appropriate buffer.
  i) immobilizing the affinity-tagged protein on a carrier comprising a carrier material to which an affinity matrix is attached, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
(a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
(b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
(c) porous organic polymers; and
ii) optionally washing the immobilized protein material with water or an appropriate buffer.
      In yet a further aspect, the invention provides a method for the preparation of an immobilized protein material, said method comprising:
  i) providing a carrier material containing amino groups, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
(a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
(b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
(c) a porous organic polymer;
  ii) reacting the carrier material with 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone, thereby linking a dihydroxyphenyl group to the carrier material;
iii) forming a chelate complex between the dihydroxyphenyl group and a metal ion capable of binding a polyhistidine-tagged protein; and
iv) binding a polyhistidine-tagged enzyme to the carrier material comprising said metal ion.
  i) providing a carrier material containing amino groups, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
(a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
(b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
(c) a porous organic polymer;
  ii) reacting the carrier material with 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone, thereby linking a dihydroxyphenyl group to the carrier material;
iii) forming a chelate complex between the dihydroxyphenyl group and a metal ion capable of binding a polyhistidine-tagged protein; and
iv) binding a polyhistidine-tagged enzyme to the carrier material comprising said metal ion.
      Optionally, the method for the preparation of an immobilized protein material as described above further comprises binding a transition metal nanoparticle to the carrier material.
      In one embodiment, the carrier is controlled porosity glass (CPG). In another embodiment, the carrier is hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG). In yet another embodiment, the carrier is a porous organic polymer.
      In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises the immobilization of affinity-tagged proteins on CPG or Hybrid CPG. In another preferred embodiment, the affinity-tagged protein is a polyhistidine-tagged enzyme and the affinity matrix contains a chelated metal ion. In a more preferred embodiment, the method comprises the immobilization of polyhistidine-tagged enzymes on CPG or Hybrid CPG, wherein the chelated metal ion used is Co 2+ or Fe 3+.
      In another aspect the invention provides an immobilized protein material obtainable by the method as described above.
      Dissociation of the bound protein can be achieved using standard IMAC methods. The bound protein may for instance be released from the carrier by lowering the pH or by adding a competitive molecule having equal or higher affinity for the chelated metal ions than the polyhistidine group, such as by applying a buffered solution containing imidazole or ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). After dissociation of the purified proteins from the carrier, the polyhistidine tag may be removed from the proteins, if necessary, by techniques known in the art, e.g. by cleaving the affinity tag with an appropriate enzyme such as a specific protease, thereby obtaining the pure and tag-less protein.
      Thus, in yet another aspect, the invention relates to a method for the purification and isolation of an affinity tagged protein, comprising the steps of
  i) immobilizing an affinity-tagged protein on a carrier comprising a carrier material to which an affinity matrix is attached, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
(a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
(b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
(c) porous organic polymers;
ii) optionally washing the immobilized protein material with water or an appropriate buffer; and
iii) dissociating the purified protein from the affinity matrix.
  i) immobilizing an affinity-tagged protein on a carrier comprising a carrier material to which an affinity matrix is attached, said carrier material being chosen from the group consisting of:
(a) controlled porosity glass (CPG);
(b) hybrid controlled porosity glass (Hybrid CPG); and
(c) porous organic polymers;
ii) optionally washing the immobilized protein material with water or an appropriate buffer; and
iii) dissociating the purified protein from the affinity matrix.
      The immobilization step may be performed in an appropriate buffer. If necessary, the immobilized protein material may thereafter be washed with water or an appropriate buffer in order to remove any unbound proteins and other, undesired compounds from the immobilized protein material. Dissociation of the purified protein from the affinity matrix may be achieved by applying conditions that are appropriate for the particular affinity tag. Appropriate conditions for the dissociation of the different affinity tags are known in the art.
      The method may optionally comprise the additional step of iv) removing the affinity tag from the purified protein.
      In a preferred embodiment, the method comprises the purification and isolation of affinity-tagged proteins on CPG or Hybrid CPG. In another preferred embodiment, the affinity-tagged protein is a polyhistidine-tagged enzyme and the affinity matrix contains a chelated metal ion. In a more preferred embodiment, the method comprises the purification and isolation of polyhistidine-tagged enzymes on CPG or Hybrid CPG, wherein the chelated metal ion used is Co 2+.
      If the proteins immobilized on the carrier, as described above, are enzymes, they contain an active site that is able to catalyze a chemical reaction. As such, the immobilized enzyme material is potentially useful as a biocatalyst in organic synthesis. Therefore, in another aspect, the invention relates to the use of an immobilized enzyme material as disclosed herein as a heterogeneous biocatalyst, for instance in synthetic organic transformations. The invention further provides a method for catalyzing an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, comprising providing an immobilized protein material according to the invention, and bringing the said immobilized protein material into contact with at least one substrate upon which an enzyme, which is immobilized on the carrier, is capable of acting.
      The immobilization of enzymes on the carrier through affinity tag binding, as disclosed herein, improves the stability of the enzymes used. It has been found that the immobilized enzymes tolerate both aqueous conditions as well as a range of different organic solvents. This enables the immobilized enzymes materials to be used in reaction conditions under which the free, non-immobilized enzymes not would have been stable. It is possible that the immobilized enzyme material also may be used in a wider pH range than the free, non-immobilized enzymes would have tolerated.
      When enzyme is bound from a crude (unpurified) preparation, the resulting immobilized protein material consists of enriched enzyme. Since the native activity of the enzyme method is retained, the immobilized preparation displays a higher catalytic activity per protein mass than the initial, non-immobilized protein material.
      Another advantage of the present invention is that the immobilized enzyme material easily can be recycled. Since the immobilized enzyme material is a heterogeneous catalyst, the material can simply be collected from the reaction mixture by filtration. The material can thereafter be re-used in a further reaction, if necessary after purification of the material. Especially for enzymes that are expensive and/or difficult to cultivate, the possibility of recycling the immobilized enzyme material is an important aspect.
      The enzyme that is immobilized on the carrier may be any enzyme that is useful as a biocatalyst in organic synthetic transformations, including, but not limited to, enzymes acting as oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases and ligases. Thus, the immobilized enzyme materials may be used as heterogeneous biocatalysts in any organic reaction wherein the immobilized enzyme is able to specifically catalyze the reaction. Examples of such biocatalytic reactions include, but are not limited to, enzymatic oxidation and reduction reactions, enzymatic hydrolysis reactions and enzymatic isomerization reactions. Particularly useful biocatalytic reactions are enantioselective reactions. Specific examples of biocatalytic reactions include selective acylations of alcohols or amines with lipase, transaminations with w-transaminase, monooxygenations with CYP P450 or Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase, oxidations of alcohols or reductions of ketones/aldehydes with alcohol dehydrogenase, and oxidations of amines with monoamine oxidase.
      In one embodiment, two or more different enzymes may be immobilized onto the carrier, wherein each of the different enzymes is able to catalyze a different reaction. It may then be possible to use the material containing two or more different immobilized enzymes as a heterogeneous biocatalyst in a multi-step or cascade reaction. Such a cascade reaction may for instance be a reaction wherein two or more enzyme-catalyzed reactions are performed on a substrate in two or more subsequent steps (i.e., a reaction wherein a substrate for a first enzyme is transformed into a substrate for a second enzyme, and so on), such as a transamination reaction by an ω-transaminase followed by an acylation reaction by a lipase. Alternatively, such a cascade reaction may be a reaction wherein a substrate is transformed by a first enzyme and wherein a co-factor for the first enzyme is regenerated by a second enzyme, such as the selective/specific reduction of a ketone/aldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase with the concomitant regeneration of consumed NADH by formate dehydrogenase.
      When two or more different enzymes are immobilized onto the carrier, it is convenient if the different enzymes contain the same affinity tag, such as a polyhistidine tag. As the binding affinity for the chelating metal ion is equal for each of the enzymes, the different enzymes will bind equally strong to the carrier. Theoretically, therefore, when using equal amounts of n different enzymes having the same affinity tag, the amount of each different enzyme on the carrier will be 1/n (not taking into account any diffusion effects).
      For cascade reactions using an immobilized protein material with two or more different immobilized enzymes, and wherein the different enzymes show a difference in catalytic activity, it may be advantageous to immobilize larger amounts of the enzyme(s) having lower catalytic activity, in comparison to the amount of enzyme having the higher catalytic activity. This will speed up the rate-determining step, and increase the overall rate of the reaction cascade.
      Alternatively, cascade reactions may be performed by mixing one or more different immobilized enzyme materials in desired ratios.
      In another aspect, the invention provides a method for catalyzing an enzyme-catalyzed multi-step or cascade reaction. In this aspect, the method comprises providing an immobilized protein material comprising two or more immobilized enzymes, according to the invention, and bringing the said immobilized protein material into contact with at least one substrate upon which the enzymes, which are immobilized on the carrier, are capable of acting.
      In another embodiment, the immobilized enzyme material additionally comprises metal nanoparticles, such as nanoparticles of transition metals, such as, but not limited to, cobalt, nickel, or palladium. Material comprising metal nanoparticles can be for instance prepared by immersing amino-CPG or amino-HybCPG in a solution of an appropriate amount of metal salt, such as CoCl 2, NiCl 2, Li 2PdCl 4, PdCl 2 or Pd(TFA) 2, in acetonitrile or water, or in mixtures thereof. The metal ions are thereafter reduced to metal nanoparticles by the addition of an excess of appropriate reducing agent, such as sodium hydride, sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, lithium aluminum hydride and the like. Upon addition of 2,4-dihydroxy-acetophenone, the initially formed imine is immediately reduced to the corresponding amine. After removal of the reducing agent by washing, a metal ion, such as Co 2+, Fe 3+ or Ni 2+, is then chelated on the matrix by suspension of the material in an aqueous solution of CoCl 2, FeCl 3 or NiCl 2, respectively. After drying, the obtained material can directly be used as a matrix for one or more polyhistidine-tagged enzymes; see FIG. 2.
      While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the metal nanoparticles bind to the CPG material through the amino groups on the CPG material. It is also conceivable that the metal nanoparticles, formed by reduction of the metal ions, are of a size large enough to be entrapped in the pores of the CPG material.
      The immobilized protein material containing both immobilized enzyme and metal nanoparticles can be applied as a heterogeneous biocatalyst in combined enzyme- and transition metal-catalyzed reactions. Examples of such reactions include, but are not limited to, dynamic kinetic resolution reactions. A specific example of such reactions is the dynamic kinetic resolution of amines by racemization of the amine by Pd nanoparticles followed by acylation with lipase, as shown in the appended examples.
      Thus, in yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for catalyzing a combined enzyme-catalyzed and transition metal-catalyzed reaction. In this aspect the method comprises providing an immobilized protein material that additionally comprises transition metal nanoparticles, according to the invention, and bringing the said immobilized protein material into contact with at least one substrate upon which an enzyme and a transition metal, which are immobilized on the carrier, are capable of acting.
      Examples of the immobilized protein material disclosed herein and the use of such material are described in the experimental section.

2611198,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Cytomegalovirus (CMV), also known as human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), is a herpes virus classified as being a member of the beta subfamily of herpesviridae. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CMV infection is found fairly ubiquitously in the human population, with an estimated 40-80% of the United States adult population having been infected. The virus is spread primarily through bodily fluids and is frequently passed from pregnant mothers to the fetus or newborn. In most individuals, CMV infection is latent, although virus activation can result in high fever, chills, fatigue, headaches, nausea, and splenomegaly.
      Although most human CMV infections are asymptomatic, CMV infections in immunocompromised individuals, (such as HIV-positive patients, allogeneic transplant patients and cancer patients) or persons whose immune system has yet fully developed (such as newborns) can be particularly problematic (Mocarski et al., Cytomegalovirus, in Field Virology, 2701-2772, Editor: Knipes and Howley, 2007). CMV infection in such individuals can cause severe morbidity, including pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, colitis, uveitis, retinitis, blindness, and neuropathy, among other deleterious conditions. In addition, CMV infection during pregnancy is a leading cause of birth defects (Adler, 2008 J. Clin Virol, 41:231; Arvin et al, 2004 Clin Infect Dis, 39:233; Revello et al, 2008 J Med Virol, 80:1415). CMV infects various cells in vivo, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, neurons, smooth muscle cells, hepatocytes, and stromal cells (Plachter et al. 1996, Adv. Virus Res. 46:195). Although clinical CMV isolates replicate in a variety of cell types, laboratory strains AD169 (Elek & Stem, 1974, Lancet 1:1) and Towne (Plotkin et al., 1975, Infect. Immun. 12:521) replicate almost exclusively in fibroblasts (Hahn et al., 2004, J. Virol. 78:10023). The restriction in tropism, which results from serial passages and eventual adaptation of the virus in fibroblasts, is stipulated a marker of attenuation (Gerna et al., 2005, J. Gen. Virol. 86:275; Gerna et al, 2002, J. Gen Virol. 83:1993; Gerna et al, 2003, J. Gen Virol. 84:1431; Dargan et al, 2010, J. Gen Virol. 91:1535). Mutations causing the loss of epithelial cell, endothelial cell, leukocyte, and dendritic cell tropism in human CMV laboratory strains have been mapped to three open reading frames (ORFs): UL128, UL130, and UL131 (Hahn et al., 2004, J. Virol. 78:10023; Wang and Shenk, 2005 J. Virol. 79:10330; Wang and Shenk, 2005 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:18153). Biochemical and reconstitution studies show that UL128, UL130 and UL131 assemble onto a gH/gL scaffold to form a pentameric gH complex (Wang and Shenk, 2005 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 102:1815; Ryckman et al, 2008 J. Virol. 82:60). Restoration of this complex in virions restores the viral epithelial tropism in the laboratory strains (Wang and Shenk, 2005 J. Virol. 79:10330).
      Loss of endothelial and epithelial tropism has been suspected as a deficiency in the previously evaluated as vaccines such as Towne (Gerna et al, 2002, J. Gen Virol. 83:1993; Gerna et al, 2003, J. Gen Virol. 84:1431). Neutralizing antibodies in sera from human subjects of natural CMV infection have more than 15-fold higher activity against viral epithelial entry than against fibroblast entry (Cui et al, 2008 Vaccine 26:5760). Humans with primary infection rapidly develop neutralizing antibodies to viral endothelial and epithelial entry but only slowly develop neutralizing antibodies to viral fibroblast entry (Gerna et al, 2008 J. Gen. Virol. 89:853). Furthermore, neutralizing activity against viral epithelial and endothelial entry is absent in the immune sera from human subjects who received Towne vaccine (Cui et al, 2008 Vaccine 26:5760). More recently, a panel of human monoclonal antibodies from four donors with HCMV infection was described, and the more potent neutralizing clones from the panel recognized the antigens of the pentameric gH complex (Macagno et al, 2010 J. Virol. 84:1005).
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention is directed to conditional replication defective CMV (rdCMV) and the use of rdCMV in compositions and methods of treating and/or decreasing the likelihood of an infection by CMV or pathology associated with such an infection in a patient. The rdCMV described herein comprises a nucleic acid encoding one or more fusion proteins that comprise an essential protein fused to a destabilizing protein. In the absence of a stabilizing agent, the fusion protein is degraded. Thus, the rdCMV can be grown in tissue culture under conditions that allow for replication (i.e., in the presence of the stabilizing agent) but replication is reduced, and preferably prevented, when administered to a patient (in the absence of the stabilizing agent).
      One embodiment of the present invention is a conditional replication defective CMV. The rdCMV comprises a nucleic acid encoding one or more fusion proteins that comprise an essential protein fused to a destabilizing protein. The nucleic acids encoding the wild type essential protein are no longer present in the rdCMV and thus the fusion protein is required for viral replication. In preferred embodiments, the essential proteins are selected from the group consisting of IE1/2, UL51, UL52, UL79 and UL84 and the destabilizing protein is FKBP or a derivative thereof.
      Another embodiment of the present invention is a composition comprising an isolated rdCMV and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition can further comprise an adjuvant including, but no limited to ISCOMATRIX® adjuvant and aluminium phosphate adjuvant.
      Another embodiment of the present invention is use of the rdCMV composition to induce an immune response against CMV in a patient. Patients can be treated prophylactically or therapeutically by administration of the rdCMV of the present invention. Prophylactic treatment provides sufficient protective immunity to reduce the likelihood or severity of a CMV infection, including primary infections, recurrent infections (i.e., those resulting from reactivation of latent CMV) and super-infections (i.e., those resulting from an infection with a different stain of CMV than previously experienced by the patient). In specific embodiments, females of childbearing age, especially early adolescent females, are vaccinated to decrease the likelihood of CMV infection (either primary, recurrent or super) during pregnancy and thus decrease the likelihood of transmission of CMV to the fetus. Therapeutic treatment can be performed to reduce the length/severity of a current CMV infection.
      Another embodiment of the present invention is methods of making the rdCMV of the invention comprising propagating the rdCMV on epithelial cells, such as ARPE-19 cells (ATCC Accession No. CRL-2302), in the presence of Shield-1. In some embodiments, the rdCMV is propagated on epithelial cells on microcarriers or other high density cell culture systems.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2681857,"BACKGROUND
      Typical symptoms of type II diabetes include the following three aspects: 1) the peripheral insulin resistance, mainly the responsiveness of bone and muscle to insulin is reduced, leading to affected glucose output of these tissues (Kahn and Goldfine, J Diabetes Complication (1993) 7:92-105; Weyer et al., J Clin Invest. (1999) 104:787-794); 2) excessive hepatic glucose production, the regulation of liver cells to the responsiveness of insulin is reduced (Kahn and Goldfine, J Diabetes Complication (1993) 7:92-105; Lam et al., Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. (2009) 11:375-378) and the excessive secretion of glucagon (Unger and Orci, Arch Intern Med. (1977) 137:482-491); and 3) disorders of pancreatic islet beta cells, at an earlier stage of a disease, an increase in beta cell proliferation and insulin secretion compensates the impact of insulin resistance on blood sugar (Bonner-Weir, Trends Endocrinol Metab. (2000) 11:375-378), but with the increase of time and the degree of insulin resistance, depletion of beta cells occurs, followed by decreased insulin secretion, thus leading to type II diabetes (DeFronzo, Diabetes. (1988) 37:667-687; Kahn et al., J Nutr. (2001) 131:354S-360S).
      Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a peptide containing 30 amino acids. It is secreted from L intestinal cells in response to the intake of glucose (Orskov et al., Diabetes (1994) 43:535-539; Drucker et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1987) 84:3431-3438). After the secretion upon stimulation, GLP-1 binds to pancreatic GLP-1R (glucagon like peptide-1 receptor) to activate the downstream adenylate cyclase signaling pathway to promote the synthesis and secretion of insulin. GLP-1 secretion also reduces gastric emptying, thereby reducing the amount of glucose into the circulatory system after food digestion (Wettergren et al., Dig. Dis. Sci. (1993) 38:665-673). In mice and in patients with type I and type II diabetes, GLP-1 increases insulin secretion and reduces blood sugar concentration (Nauck et al., Diabetes. (1997) 105:187-195; Todd et al., Eur J Clin Invest. (1997) 27:533-536). Studies have shown that GLP-1 can also inhibit apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells and promote their proliferation (Perfetti et al., Endocrinology (2000) 141:4600-4605; Hui et al., Endocrinology (2003) 144:1444-1455). The feasibility and efficacy of GLP-1 for the treatment of diabetes patients have been proved clinically (Samson and Garber, Curr Opin Endocrinol Diabetes Obes. (2013) 20:87-97). There are also patents (U.S. Pat. No. 5,899,883 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,989,148) disclosing methods for the treatment of diabetes by using GLP-1 and its derivatives. However, GLP-1 has a short half-life in vivo and does not have good therapeutic effects.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      One objective of the present invention is to provide an antibody specifically binding to GLP-1R.
      The second objective of the present invention is to provide a fusion protein of an antibody specifically binding to GLP-1R with GLP-1, which can extend the half-life of GLP-1 in vivo to retain the biological activity of GLP-1. At the same time, the fusion protein formed by GLP-1 and the antibody specifically binding to GLP-1R has the molecular targeting properties provided by the antibody. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of the antibody is also lower than that of other fusion partners.
      To solve the technical problems mentioned above, the present invention provides the following technical solutions.

      Given that the key role of GLP-1R plays in the use of glucagon like peptide-1 for the regulation and control of blood glucose levels in type II diabetes patients, and that its significant therapeutic characteristic is the ability of stimulating insulin secretion without the associated risk of hypoglycaemia. GLP-1 is fused with an antibody specifically binding to GLP-1R in the present invention, thereby prolonging the half-life of GLP-1 in vivo to retain the biological activity of GLP-1. At the same time, the fusion protein formed by GLP-1 and the antibody specifically binding to GLP-1R has the molecular targeting properties provided by the antibody. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of the antibody is also lower than that of other fusion partners.
      The beneficial effects of the present invention are as follows: GLP-1 is capable of fusing with an antibody specifically binding to GLP-1R, thus prolonging the half-life of GLP-1 in vivo to retain the biological activity of GLP-1. At the same time, the fusion protein formed by GLP-1 and the antibody specifically binding to GLP-1R has the molecular targeting properties provided by the antibody. Furthermore, the immunogenicity of the antibody is also lower than that of other fusion partners.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2711371,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Adenoviruses have been extensively used as gene delivery vectors for gene therapy as well as oncolytic agents for cancer treatment. They exhibit several features that make them suitable for these applications. Namely, their structure and biology has been widely studied which allows for an easy modification of their genome, they are able to infect both replicating and non-replicating cells, and they can easily be produced at high titers for their use in the clinic. In terms of safety, they do not cause life-threatening diseases in humans, and their genome is non-integrative which prevents for insertional mutagenesis. Clinical trials with adenovirus-based vectors report a good toxicology and safety profile, although the efficacy still needs improvement, especially when the virus is administered systemically.
      In the field of gene therapy, systemic administration, that is, injection into the bloodstream endovenously or intra-arterially, may be needed to reach multiple organs or disseminated cells. For example, in cancer therapy with adenovirus vectors and oncolytic adenoviruses systemic administration is necessary to treat disseminated tumours at an advanced or metastatic stage. Nonetheless, adenoviruses show important limitations when injected into the bloodstream that impair the efficacy of the therapy. Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) suffers multiple neutralizing interactions in the bloodstream that reduce drastically the bioavailability of the virus. Liver sequestration represents the major obstacle for the therapy since >90% of the injected dose is retained by this organ, mainly by liver macrophages named Kupffer cells, but also by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and hepatocytes. Direct interaction with blood cells and proteins also represents an important barrier. Ad5 can bind directly to blood cells such as erythrocytes via CAR receptor and to platelets via integrins. Antibodies not only can neutralize the virus directly but can also trigger an innate immune response by complement activation and by docking the virus particles to the Fc receptors of monocytes and neutrophils. Furthermore, vector re-administration raises the levels of anti-Ad neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and therefore the neutralization of the virus. Adenovirus opsonization by antibodies and complement also enhances clearance by Kupffer cells. Altogether, these interactions result in a very short half-life of Ad in blood, of about few minutes in mice and humans.
      Extensive efforts have been made to evade the neutralization by antibodies and immune cells when the adenovirus is systemically administered.
      Chemical modification of adenovirus capsid with polymers (polyethyleneglycol (PEG) or N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA)) has been tested. Polymer conjugation on viral surface enabled the virus to evade neutralization by antibodies and immune cells as well as ablates CAR, integrin, and FX-binding. Nevertheless, polymers conjugated to the capsid do not pass to the virus progeny and increase the complexity of large-scale GMP production for clinical application.
      WO 2011/129468 A9 discloses a chimeric adenovirus capable of evading immune recognition of neutralizing antibodies. Said adenovirus was obtained by genetic modification of the capsid of human adenovirus serotype 5, wherein the gene that codes for hexon protein was replaced by the hexon gene from simian adenovirus serotype 19. The chimeric adenovirus obtained showed also higher anti-tumour activity than the same adenovirus without the genetic modification.
      Several attempts have been made in order to obtain an adenovirus shielded by albumin protein (see WO 2007/050128 A2). However, experimental evidence has demonstrated that an adenovirus having a capsid modified with an albumin-binding domain is not protected against neutralizing antibodies (Hedley S. J. et al. 2009. The Open Gene Therapy Journal, 2:1-11).
      Therefore, there is still a need for further genetic modified adenovirus suitable for systemic administration and capable of escaping neutralizing antibodies.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2672053,"BACKGROUND
      Polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccines are made using polysaccharides, generally from the surface coat of bacteria, linked to protein carriers. The chemical bonding of the polysaccharide and protein carrier induces an immune response against bacteria displaying the polysaccharide contained within the vaccine on their surface, thus preventing disease. Accordingly, vaccination using polysaccharides from pathogenic bacteria is a potential strategy for boosting host immunity. The polysaccharides that cover bacteria vary greatly, even within a single species of bacteria. For example, in Streptococcus pneumoniae (a leading cause of meningitis, pneumonia, and severe invasive disease in infants and young children throughout the world) there are more than 90 different serotypes due to variation in the bacterial polysaccharide coat. Therefore, polysaccharide vaccines often consist of a panel of polysaccharides to increase protection.
      Although polysaccharides are immunogenic on their own, conjugation of polysaccharides to protein carriers has been used to improve immunogenicity. The carrier protein can be either a related protein antigen from the target pathogen, boosting the specific immune response to that pathogen, or a generally immunogenic protein that serves more as an adjuvant or general immune response stimulant.
      Multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed for many years and have proved valuable in preventing pneumococcal disease in infants and have recently been recommended for adults.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2637367,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Major causes of retinal photoreceptor degeneration include retinitis pigmentosa (RP), age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), diabetic retinopathy and other diseases. Approximately one in three thousand, or three million people worldwide, suffer from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a genetic condition that leads to photoreceptor degeneration and eventually blindness. The rate and severity of photoreceptor degeneration is variable and highly dependant on the mutation itself. Over fifty genes may be affected (Hartong et al. Lancet 368:1795-1809; 2006). To date, little treatment is available for RP patients. Ongoing trials that focus on neuroprotective agents (e.g. ciliary neurotrophic factor) or gene addition therapy (introducing the “non-mutated” gene), which aim to correct acquired or hereditary gene deficiencies to the natural functional gene, have so far shown only marginal success. Given that the adult retina has no ability to generate new photoreceptors after photoreceptor loss, gene addition therapy is only useful as long as photoreceptor loss is small and mainly slows down or stabilizes the early condition.
      An alternative approach employed in recent experimental studies is to render the remaining photoreceptors or surviving inner retinal neurons light-sensitive through transgenic expression of a light-sensitive protein.
      In US 2009/0088399 and US 2010/0015095 it is proposed to introduce the light-gated algal ion-channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into the inner retina of patients suffering from photoreceptor cell degeneration This renders the naturally light-insensitive inner retinal cells, such as bipolar or amacrine cells, light-sensitive and capable of detecting visual information, which is subsequently relayed to the brain without receiving input from photoreceptors.
      Similarly, in US 2005/0208022 and US 2009/0208462 it is proposed to introduce a photoreceptive protein such as an opsin (including melanopsin) or cytochromes into the inner retinal neurons including amacrine, horizontal and bipolar cells of patients suffering from photoreceptor degeneration.
      The approach to express ChR2 in inner retinal neurons holds considerable promise and is currently tested in non-human primates (Fradot M et al. Human Gene Therapy 22(5), 587-593; 2011) and isolated human retinas (Ivanova E et al. Opthalmol Vis Sci 51(10), 5288-5296, 2010), raising hope for clinical trials in the near future.
      In recent years retinal gene-replacement therapy using recombinant Adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been successful and has reached final clinical trials. In particular, Bainbridge and colleagues used rAAV to replace the defective retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65-kDa protein gene (RPE65). A deficiency in the RPE65 protein renders photoreceptors unable to respond to light, as it is required for the recycling of the chromophore, i.e. the conversion of all-trans retinal to 11-cis retinal (Bainbridge J W B et al., N Engl J Med 358(21), 2231-2239; 2008). Gene therapy is therefore a promising therapeutic approach to correct for visual deficiencies by the introduction of suitable genes into retinal neurons.
      The currently available light-activatable proteins that could be used in gene therapy to compensate for the loss of photoreceptor cells, however, still hold a number of substantial drawbacks: 1) Artificial expression of foreign, invertebrate or algal proteins, e.g. ChR2, could trigger unpredictable immune reactions in patients. 2) ChR2 has a relatively high permeability to calcium, which might be toxic over the long term. 3) The ChR2 response is inherently weak at natural light intensities as each captured photon can only activate a single protein. 4) Although, melanopsin is able to amplify light-signals by gating the activities of high-throughput enzymatic reactions, these enzymatic partners are not sufficiently available in inner retinal neurons. Therefore, the expression of melanopsin in ganglion cells and ON-bipolar cells does not elicit an amplification of the light signal sufficient to restore functional vision at natural light intensities. 5) Also, the regulatory mechanisms that naturally control protein activity through changes in turnover and modulation are absent when expressing foreign proteins.
      The object of the current invention is to provide a light-sensitive chimeric protein, which, when expressed in inner retinal neurons, overcomes these deficiencies. That is, it is an object of the invention to provide a superior light-sensitive protein for the improvement and restoration of vision, particularly in patients with retinal photoreceptor degeneration. This chimeric protein will improve or restore light-sensitivity to a higher extent compared to the light-sensitivity that is obtainable by proteins proposed in the state of the art. Further objects of the invention include the genetic information encoding the chimeric light-sensitive protein and methods of expressing this chimeric protein in living cells and organisms. Yet further objects of the invention include the expression of the genetic information encoding the chimeric light-sensitive protein in inner retinal cells in vivo for therapeutic treatment and biomedical products comprising the light-sensitive protein or genetic information encoding the chimeric protein.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      This technical problem is solved by a light-sensitive chimeric protein comprising domains from at least two members of the G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) protein super family, which are fused to yield a light-sensitive GPCR chimera capable of coupling a light signal to the signaling cascade of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6).
      The G-protein-coupled-receptor (GPCR) protein super family members are transmembrane protein receptors transmitting signals from the cell surface to intracellular effectors. They have a structure, which typically comprises seven transmembrane domains (TM1 to TM7), three extracellular loops (EL1 to EL3), three intracellular loops (IL1 to IL3), an extracellular N-terminal domain (NT) and an intracellular C-terminal (CT) domain. The GPCR protein super family includes light-sensitive receptor proteins called photopigments such as opsins, for example rhodopsin and melanopsin. The GPCR super family also include ligand-gated metabotropic receptors, for example mGluR6. The metabotropic G-protein coupled receptors are indirectly linked to ion channels in the membrane via a signal transduction cascade mediated by specific G-proteins accomplishing an amplification of the signal. That is, activated G-proteins regulate the activity of enzymes, for example adenylate cyclase, which rapidly produce large quantities of product, for example cAMP, which may in turn activate large numbers of ion channels in the cell membrane. In contrast to such metabotropic GPCRs, ionotropic receptors are directly linked to ion channels in the membrane. Therefore, ionotropic receptors like channelrhodopsin are not capable of signal amplification like metabotropic receptors.
      One aspect of the invention concerns a chimeric GPCR protein, comprising domains which are derived from at least two GPCR family members:
      A first of the at least two GPCR family members contributes domains which mediate the light sensitivity to the chimeric light-sensitive GPCR protein. This first member belongs to the family of light-sensitive GPCR proteins also called photopigments, and in some embodiments this light-sensitive GPCR protein is melanopsin, in particular human melanopsin.
      A second of the at least two GPCR family members, namely mGluR6, contributes domains for coupling the light signal to the intracellular signalling cascade of mGluR6.
      mGluR6 is a native component of the cell membrane of ON-bipolar cells in the inner retina. For the therapeutic aspects of the current invention these ON-bipolar cells are the target cells in which the light-sensitive chimeric GPCR protein will be expressed. Physiologically, the native ON-bipolar cell mGluR6 activates its intracellular signal cascade upon extracellular binding of glutamate. Thus, the ON bipolar cells naturally contain the specific intracellular components mediating the mGluR6 signaling cascade.
      In the physiological light signal transduction pathway, light-activated healthy rod and cone photoreceptor cells respond to a decrease in light intensity with an increase in the level of glutamate released from their synaptic terminals, which then binds to mGluR6 on ON-bipolar cells, which in turn elicits an amplification of the light signal through the specific G-Protein coupled intracellular signaling cascade of mGluR6. In analogy to this natural pathway, the chimeric light-sensitive GPCR protein expressed in ON-bipolar cells of blind retinas transmits the light-signal to the still existing (Kriz{hacek over (a)}j D et al., Vision Res. 50:2460-65, 2010) intracellular signal cascade of the mGluR6 receptor upon light activation.
      Remarkably, the ON-bipolar cells, when complemented with the chimeric light-sensitive GPCR protein, directly perceive the light signal via the chimeric light-sensitive GPCR protein, bypassing the indirect glutamate signal that follows the light-stimulation of the photoreceptors. Thus, the chimeric light-sensitive GPCR protein is capable of directly coupling light activation to the mGluR6 signal cascade. In other words, light activation is independent of any functional rod or cone photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, the physiological amplification of the signal elicited by one photon is retained through the signalling cascade of the mGluR6.
      The term “domain” in the context of this patent application refers to the intracellular and extracellular loops, the N- and C-termini and the transmembrane regions of a member of the GPCR protein family. The term “domain derived from” such as domain derived from mGluR6 or a domain derived from an opsin includes any domain for which the physiologically relevant corresponding part has an identical amino acid sequence or a similar amino acid sequence to the sequence of such domain in the physiological counterpart of the GPCR family member. In general, similar amino acid sequences or similar domains exhibit at least a 60% homology, preferably at least a 80% homology and most preferably at least a 90% homology. Similar domains also particularly include domains comprising relevant conserved amino acids, independent of whether a part of the remaining sequence is deviating or missing from the native counterpart or whether additional sequences are present in the chimeric protein that are not present in the native GPCR family member.
      In some embodiments the chimeric protein comprises a light-activatable extracellular domain which is derived from a bi-stable photopigment, such as melanopsin but not rhodopsin for example. The advantage of bi-stable photopigments is that they are recycled after bleaching through recovery by light rather than by external cellular enzymes. The recovery rate is very fast and will sustain a high light-sensitivity even at high light intensities. With bi-stable photopigments, light bleaching and bleach recovery are increased equally at high light intensities, whereas rhodopsin, which is not bi-stable, looses its photosensitivity during illumination as more and more rhodopsins are bleached. Light bleaching in non-bi-stable photopigments such as rhodopsin can lead in the worst case to short-term blindness. The recovery rate could even be slower when a non-bi-stable photopigment such as rhodopsin is expressed in a foreign cell type, because the recovery enzymes are not necessarily available in proximity. In a healthy retina these enzymes are located in the retinal pigment epithelium.
      Accordingly the choice of the domains of the first member of the chimeric GPCR, to be derived from a bi-stable photopigment renders the recovery of the chimeric GPCR after light-bleaching independent of the availability of bleach-recovery enzymes. In some embodiments the light-activatable domain of a bi-stable photoreceptor protein is selected from the opsin family, and most preferably is melanopsin and, if used in human patients, it is human melanopsin to avoid an immune reaction.
      In some embodiments of the chimeric GPCR protein the first GPCR member contributes at least the domains containing the amino acid residues forming the Schiff' base (linking the chromophore covalently to the GPCR), which are for melanopsin Tyrosine 149 (Y149) in TM3 and Lysine 321 (K321) in TM7, or all the domains derived from the domains which form the chromophore binding pocket in the physiological counterpart. The chromophore binding pocket refers to the binding site for the light pigment, which absorbs a photon such as for example 11-cis retinal in melanopsin (Hermann et al., Neuroscience letters, Vol. 376 p 76-80, 2004.)
      In some other embodiments the chimeric GPCR protein comprises all of the extracellular domains of the first GPCR member, which are the N-terminus and the three extracellular loops (EL1, EL2, EL3) and additionally all of the seven transmembrane domains (TM1 to TM7) from the first GPCR member.
      In either of these embodiments, at least one of the intracellular domains of the chimeric GPCR protein, i.e. at least one of the intracellular loops IL1, IL2, IL3 and/or the C terminus is derived from the second GPCR, which is mGluR6. In some embodiments the at least one intracellular domain derived from mGluR6 is IL3 or is IL3 and additionally at least one of the other intracellular domains, e.g. IL3 and IL2 or IL 3 and IL 2 and the C-terminus or other combinations.
      Functional chimeric GPCR proteins according to the invention are light-sensitive and capable of coupling light activation to the mGluR6 signaling cascade. Depending on which photopigment is chosen as first GPCR member for the chimeric protein, either some or all transmembrane domains and extracellular domains of this photopigment are used. The domains required for forming a chromophore pocket are necessary to render the chimeric protein light activatable, which according to current knowledge are for example TM3 to TM 7 in melanopsin and TM2 to TM 7 in channelrhodopsin.
      The domains which are necessary for coupling light activation to the mGluR6 signaling cascade must be capable of binding to the G-Protein specific for the mGluR6 pathway, Galpha(o). IL3 appears to be particularly relevant for the specific binding to the G-protein of the GPCR signal cascade. Generally, the other intracellular loops and the C-terminus enhance the specificity of G-protein binding over embodiments in which some or all of IL1 and IL2 and the C-terminal domain are not derived from mGluR6.
      In some embodiments the chimeric GPCR protein comprises domains which are derived from another bi-stable GPCR protein (or opsin chimeras based on a bi-stable GPCR) which is not the first and not the second member.
      For minimizing potential immunogenic reactions and for optimizing the physiological coupling to the mGluR6 in some embodiments to be used for medical therapy in humans, the light-sensitive domains are derived from human GPCRs such as human melanopsin, human rhodopsin, human cone-opsin but also chimeric human opsins.
      The light-sensitive chimeric GPCR protein is constructed by fusing the genetic information encoding domains of the GPCR members with the desired functionalities of light-sensitivity and coupling of the light activation to the signaling cascade of mGluR6 according to techniques known in the art. Identification of the desired domains and determination of suitable cutting and ligation sites at the N- and C-terminal ends of any particular domain are primarily based on 1) alignment of gene sequences/conserved residues and 2) computer modeling of the secondary and tertiary structure of the light-sensitive GPCR family member and mGluR6, using standard software available in the art. This approach has an inherent variability in the exact definition of the length of the individual domains and such variability is included within the scope of this invention when speaking of domains. Furthermore, at individual fusion sites between domains, there are generally a number of possibilities of splicing the domains together to yield a functional protein. And, evidently, deletion of portions of an amino acid sequence not required for function, conservative amino acid substitutions, for example interchanging hydrophobic with hydrophobic or hydrophilic with hydrophilic amino acids, and nucleotide substitutions are also within the scope of the invention. Accordingly, a considerable number of sequence variants particularly in regions of the fusion sites between adjacent domains of the chimeric GPCR proteins fall within the scope of the invention, provided that they yield functional chimeric GPCR proteins. In embodiments in which all of the transmembrane and the extracellular domains are derived from the first GPCR member and at least one or all of the intracellular domains are replaced with corresponding domains derived from mGluR6, all feasible cutting and ligation sites for exchanging IL1, IL2, IL3 and the C-terminus are within the scope of the invention.
      Further aspects of the invention concern the genetic information of a light-activatable chimeric GPCR protein capable of coupling the light activation to the signaling cascade of mGluR6, vectors including viral vectors such as rAAVs comprising this genetic information, transgenic animals such as mice and zebra fish comprising this genetic information and cell culture cells comprising such genetic information or expressing light-activatable chimeric GPCR proteins capable of coupling the light activation to the signaling cascade of mGluR6, including in particular neuronal cell lines, inner retinal neuronal cell lines and bipolar cell lines in particular ON-bipolar cells.
      A further aspect of the invention concerns methods of introducing the genetic information for expression of a light-activatable chimeric GPCR protein capable of coupling the light activation to the signaling cascade of mGluR6 into the eye, preferably into ON-bipolar cells. Yet a further aspect of the invention concerns methods of introducing the genetic information for expression of a light-activatable chimeric GPCR protein capable of coupling the light activation to the signaling cascade of mGluR6 into cell culture cells, in particular into neural cell lines, including retinal cell lines, inner retinal cell lines and bipolar cell lines.
      A further aspect of the invention concerns gene therapeutic methods of introducing the light-sensitive chimeric GPCR protein capable of coupling light activation to the signaling cascade of mGluR6 into the eye, in particular into the vitreal or subretinal space to target retinal cells including ON-bipolar cells of both rod and cone photoreceptor cells, for improving vision in medical therapy. Such gene therapeutic methods include but are not limited to electroporation, viral transduction and chemical-based transfection. Such medical therapy in particular includes the treatment of partial or complete blindness, e.g. for the treatment of retinitis pigementosa (RP) and macular degeneration (ARMD) as well as other forms of photoreceptor degeneration.
      Yet a further aspect of the invention concerns the light-sensitive chimeric GPCR protein capable of coupling light-activation to the signaling cascade of mGluR6 or the genetic information encoding said chimeric protein and compositions comprising said protein or said genetic information as such or within vectors or cells for the purpose of medical therapy, in particular for improving vision, for the treatment of partial or complete blindness, for the treatment of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular degeneration (ARMD) as well as other forms of photoreceptor degeneration.
      Physiologically, the metabotropic glutamate receptor of ON-bipolar cells in the inner nuclear layer of the retina is activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate in response to retinal photoreceptor cell activity. When the photoreceptors are stimulated by light, the concentration of glutamate released onto ON-bipolar cells changes. The light-sensitive chimeric GPCR protein is a variant of the native mGluR6 protein, which is activated by light directly whereas the native mGluR6 protein is activated indirectly via glutamate after stimulation of the photoreceptor cells by changes in light. Therefore, patients suffering from photoreceptor degeneration can be treated by expressing a chimeric light-activatable protein comprising intracellular domains of mGluR6 capable of coupling the light activation to the signaling cascade of the mGluR6 in their ON-bipolar cells.
      In some embodiments of the light-sensitive chimeric GPCR protein at least one or all of the intracellular components of melanopsin or another bi-stable photopigment are substituted with the intracellular components of mGluR6, resulting in a chimeric protein comprising the photoreceptor domains of melanopsin, which is able to drive existing intracellular mGluR6 signaling cascades in inner retinal neurons, in particular in ON-bipolar cells.
      Due to artificial expression of a chimeric light activatable mGluR6-melanopsin protein in ON-bipolar cells, weak light signals are amplified by steering the physiological pre-existing fast enzymatic reactions regulated by native mGluR6. Also, such chimeric proteins will escape immune reactions, when extracellular domains of native photoreceptor proteins such as human melanopsin are used, because the only part accessible to the immune system will be identical to that of native human melanopsin.
      An advantage of using mGluR6 as the first GPCR member is that mGluR6 is expressed only in ON-bipolar cells in the retina. Therefore, transgenically expressed chimeric mGluR6-melanopsin will efficiently couple to the mGluR6 signaling cascade in ON bipolar cells only. Moreover, the degradation and modulation of the chimeric protein (e.g. arrestin binding) will occur through pre-existing mGluR6 pathways, allowing full self-control of protein activity.
      There is yet another particular effect of the expression of the chimeric light-sensitive mGluR6-melanopsin protein in ON bipolar cells to restore vision, which differs from other vision recovery methods: Visual contrast will actually be inverted; dark will appear bright and bright will appear dark. That is, neural circuits naturally activated by an increase in light intensity will be activated by a decrease in light intensity and vice versa. This in fact might have a key advantage over the prior art as outlined below:
      Photoreceptors release relatively high levels of their neurotransmitter (glutamate) in the dark and less transmitter as the brightness increases. The ON-bipolar cells receive their input through mGluR6 receptors, which hyperpolarize the bipolar cells when activated (in the dark) and vice versa. If there are no photoreceptors, there is no glutamate, the ON-bipolar cells are depolarized and the surviving inner retina is effectively in an “extremely bright light” adaptive mode. In fact, the very slow degeneration of ON bipolar cells may be due to this sustained depolarization. Retinitis pigmentosa patients are not aware of the light adaptation of their retina, because the retinal output only signals spatial and temporal changes in light intensity. That is, if changes in intensity are not detected, the retina will effectively send no signal to the brain, although the retina is in the fully light adapted state.
      For improving vision in patients with partial or total loss of photoreceptor cells, it is important to take into consideration that the retina is in a fully light-adapted state. This implies that the ON-bipolar cells are permanently relatively depolarized. Channelrhodopsin-2 expressed in ON-bipolar cells will only depolarize these cells further and thus the signal difference between the light-ON and the light-OFF state is relatively small. In contrast, the ON-bipolar cells expressing the chimeric light-sensitive mGluR6-GPCR protein according to the invention are hyperpolarized by light. Evidently, this increases signal difference and thus enhances output and accordingly light sensitivity.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2757426,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Group B Streptococcus ( Streptococcus agalactiae) (GBS) is the major cause of invasive bacterial infections, including meningitis, in the neonatal period. In the United States alone, there are now about 5000 cases per year of invasive disease caused by this bacterium. These infections have an overall mortality of about 10%, and many of the infants that survive have permanent neurological sequelae. In view of this, a large effort has been made to find methods of prevention and treatment and to analyze the mechanisms by which GBS cause infections.
      The GBS can also cause mastitis in cows, a bovine disease that is of considerable economical importance. Development of a vaccine against GBS infections is therefore of interest also in veterinary medicine.
      About 20% of all women are vaginal carriers of GBS, and vertical transmission from the maternal genital tract is probably the most common source of infection in neonatal disease caused by this bacterium. However, only about 1% of the infants that are colonized by the GBS at birth are afflicted by serious infection. Other factors than exposure to the bacterium during birth must therefore contribute to the development of neonatal disease.
      Group B streptococcal strains are divided into nine serotypes (Ia, Ib, and II-VIII) based on the structure of the polysaccharide capsule (Baker, J Inf Dis 1990. 161: 917). The four “classical” serotypes Ia, Ib, II, and III occur in roughly equal proportions among strains in the normal flora, but type III is the clinically most important serotype, in particular because it causes most cases of meningitis.
      Because the capsule is a known virulence factor, it has been studied in considerable detail, in particular in type III strains. Efforts have been made to develop a vaccine, in which the type III polysaccharide capsule would be an essential component.
      EP 0 866 133 discloses a vaccine capable of protecting a recipient from infection caused by group B Streptococcus. The invention is directed to the use of a combination of a polysaccharide and a fragment of the epsilon protein. It further discloses that epidemiological data suggest that the type-specific capsule plays an important role in the immunity to group B Streptococcus infections (se page 7 line 2-3). Additionally, there are a number of different combinations between different proteins and the polysaccharide mentioned within the application but all the claims comprise a polysaccharide which shows the importance of that particular component. However, use of the polysaccharide capsule as a vaccine may give problems due to cross reactions with human tissues (Pritchard et al., Infect Immun 1992. 60: 1598). It would therefore be very valuable if one could develop a vaccine based on proteins rather than on polysaccharides.
      The document Gravekamp et al., Infection and Immunity, December 1997, p 5216-5221 discloses the evaluation of the immunogenicity as well as protection of the number of repeats of the alpha (a) C protein as well as the N-terminal part alone. It was found that the immunogenicity decreased with increasing number of repeats (se FIG. 2B). However, it was also found in a protection assay that the antibodies against the N-terminal region were predominantly responsible for the protection compared to antibodies against the N-terminal region (see page 5219 left column, line 6 from the bottom, and page 5220 right column lines 26-29).
      WO 9410317 describes the use of the alpha protein, a GBS surface protein, in the development of a conjugate vaccine. A drawback with this protein is that it usually is not expressed by type III strains, which are the cause of many serious GBS infections. Hence, a protective immunity against these strains will not be evoked by an alpha protein vaccine.
      WO 9421685 describes the use of the Rib protein, a GBS surface protein, in the development of a vaccine. This protein elicits immunity when administered with alum. However, the Rib protein has the disadvantage that it does not evoke a protective immunity against all GBS strains.
      WO 2008127179 describes a fusion protein comprising at least one first N-terminal region fragment of a group B Streptococcus surface protein or analogue, homologue, derivative or immunologically related amino acid sequence or fragments thereof, which is fused to at least one second N-terminal region fragment of a group B Streptococcus surface protein or analogue, homologue, derivative or immunologically related amino acid sequence or fragments thereof, wherein the first and second at least one N-terminal region fragments of group B Streptococcus surface proteins derive from different group B Streptococcus strains, and wherein the fusion protein is capable of eliciting protective immunity against group B Streptococcus.
      The document Lindahl et al, Nonimmunodominant Regions Are Effective As Building Blocks In A Streptococcal Fusion Protein Vaccine, Cell Host & Microbe 2, 427-434, December 2007, discloses a fusion protein comprising N-terminal regions of the group B Streptococcus surface proteins Rib and AlpC.
      The document Maeland et al, Survey of Immunological Features of the Alpha-Like Proteins of Streptococcus agalactiae, Clinical and Vaccine Immunology, February 2015 Volume 22 Number 2, discloses that a two-component vaccine, one immunogenic peptide corresponding to a repeat area stretch of C-alpha or Alp1, either of which cross-reacts strongly ( FIG. 2; Table 1), and one peptide corresponding to a repeat area stretch of Alp3 or Rib, either of which also cross-reacts strongly ( FIG. 3; Table 1), may provide broad protective activity.
      Despite the advances in the progress towards a vaccine suitable for prevention of GBS disease, there is still a need for further methods and vaccines for prevention and treatment of GBS infections. Thus, there remains a need to explore vaccines strategies capable of eliciting protective immunity against a wide range of GBS stains.
      Accordingly, it is a primary objective of the present invention to provide an immunogenic fusion protein which can be used in a vaccine capable of eliciting protective immunity against GBS infections.
      It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a vaccine that elicits protective immunity against many clinically important GBS strains.
      Another objective of the present invention is to provide a vaccine comprising a single, or a few, immunogenic fusion proteins that elicits protective immunity against GBS infections. A single or a few proteins has several advantages over a vaccine composed of numerous proteins, e.g. cost of production and safety.
      The means of accomplishing each of the above objectives as well as others will become apparent from the description of the invention which follows hereafter.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention is based on realization, by the present inventors, that the coverage of the fusion protein disclosed in WO 2008127179 is more limited than previously thought. This is because it was heretofore thought that the important Group B Streptococcus serotype Ia expressed predominantly AlpC surface protein, whereas cross reactivity studies carried out on behalf of the present inventor show that the majority of the Group B Streptococcus serotype Ia bacteria express Alp1 instead of AlpC.
      It was furthermore realized that cross-reactivity between different Alp/Rib N-terminal domains cannot be directly predicted based on sequence homologies between the domains. This was realized when the cross-reactivity of rabbit antibodies raised against the previously disclosed Rib-AlpC-NN fusion protein disclosed in WO 2008127179 was tested against N-terminal domains of the Streptococcus Surface proteins Rib, AlpC, Alp1 and Alp2, and against the immunogenic fusion protein according to the first aspect of the present invention as introduced below. The results showed similar reactivities against the Rib-AlpC-NN fusion protein and AlpC N-terminal domains. However, 10-fold lover reactivity was observed against Rib and Alp2 N-terminal domains. Even lower cross-reactivity was observed against Alp1 N-terminal domains, and the immunogenic fusion protein according to the first aspect of the present invention. In addition hereto, mice immunized with the immunogenic fusion protein according to the first aspect of the present invention showed a 2-log reduction in cross-reactivity with the Rib-AlpC-NN fusion protein compared to the titer obtained against the immunogenic fusion protein according to the first aspect of the present invention. Likewise, mice immunized with the Rib-AlpC-NN fusion protein showed a similar reduction in reactivity against the immunogenic fusion protein according to the first aspect of the present invention, and in addition hereto, the maximum amount of binding against the cross-reactive epitopes were also reduced.
      Accordingly there was revealed to the present inventors an unexpected need for a further immunogenic fusion protein including Alp1, Alp2, or Alp4, for obtaining protection against Group B Streptococcus infections.
      Thus a first aspect of the present invention relates to an immunogenic fusion protein comprising:
a first amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of a first group B Streptococcus surface protein, which is fused to
a second amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of a second group B Streptococcus surface protein
wherein each of the first and the second group B Streptococcus surface protein is selected from the group consisting of Rib protein, Alp1 protein, Alp2 protein, Alp3 protein, Alp4 protein and AlpC protein, wherein the immunogenic fusion protein comprises at least one amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of the group B streptococcus surface protein Alp1, Alp2, Alp3 or Alp4, and wherein the immunogenic fusion protein is capable of eliciting protective immunity against group B Streptococcus.
a first amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of a first group B Streptococcus surface protein, which is fused to
a second amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of a second group B Streptococcus surface protein
wherein each of the first and the second group B Streptococcus surface protein is selected from the group consisting of Rib protein, Alp1 protein, Alp2 protein, Alp3 protein, Alp4 protein and AlpC protein, wherein the immunogenic fusion protein comprises at least one amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of the group B streptococcus surface protein Alp1, Alp2, Alp3 or Alp4, and wherein the immunogenic fusion protein is capable of eliciting protective immunity against group B Streptococcus.
      A major advantage of the immunogenic fusion protein of the invention is that it comprises at least one amino acid sequence having at least 80% sequence identity with the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of the group B streptococcus surface protein Alp1, Alp2, Alp3 or Alp4, either of which is expressed by many clinically important strains of group B Streptococcus, and most importantly, it will provide protective immunity against these further important strains.
      The immunogenic fusion protein has the advantage that it is immunogenic even without adjuvant, however it can also be used with an adjuvant for increased immunogenicity, eliciting protective immunity against strains expressing the surface proteins. Moreover, the immunogenic fusion protein according to the present invention may be used in the vaccine according to the present invention and is expected to be administered with alum or Aluminium hydroxide (AlOH), an adjuvant accepted for use in humans. In contrast, the recently described “universal vaccine” was only reported to work together with Freund's adjuvant, a strongly irritating component that cannot be used in human medicine (Maione, D. et al, Science 2005. 309:148-150).
      Another advantage with the present invention is that a vaccine composition according to the invention can be composed of the immunogenic fusion protein according to the first aspect of the present invention combined with a further fusion protein such as the Rib-AlpC-NN fusion protein of WO 2008127179, thus providing an immunogenic product capable of providing full coverage of protection against all clinically relevant Group B Streptococcus strains using only two fusion proteins instead of needing to use 5 or 6, or even more, different capsular proteins.
      More specifically, the present invention relates to the immunogenic fusion protein; an immunogenic product; an isolated nucleotide sequence; a vector; a host cell; a vaccine; and a method for preventing or treating a group B Streptococcus infection.
      The present invention will be described in more detail below.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2757394,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 (LAIR-1) is an inhibitory cell surface receptor that is expressed on many immune cells and exerts inhibitory signaling through two cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domains (Verbrugge et al., 2006, 1 Leukoc. Biol. 79:828-836). LAIR-1 is cross-linked by multiple collagens, complement component C1q, and surfactant protein D (SP-D) to induce negative signaling that inhibits immune cell maturation, proliferation and degranulation (Lebbink et al., 2009 , Matrix Biol. 28:202-210; Meyaard., 2008 , J. Leukoc. Biol. 83:799-803). The human, but not mouse, genome encodes a soluble LAIR-2 protein (Sun et al., 2014 , Gene 552:140-145). The LAIR-2 protein binds the same ligands as LAIR-1, and thus may function as a decoy to reduce inhibitory signals through LAIR-1.
      LAIR-1 inhibitory signaling may prevent autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroid disease and atherosclerosis as well as contact hypersensitivity (Sun et al., 2014 , Gene 552:140-145). Reduced expression of LAIR-1 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells is associated with increased disease (Poggi et al., 2008 , Leukemia 22:980-988; Perbellini et al., 2014 , Haematolagica 99:881-887). LAIR-1 has also been shown to be expressed on epithelial ovarian cancer cells and other human tumors, although the function of LAIR-1 expressed on solid tumors remains unclear (Meyaard et al., 1997 , Immunity 7:283-290; Cao et al., 2015 , Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 458:399-404).
      LAIR-1 expression on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and potentially acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells has been shown to be essential for their growth through a phosphatase independent LAIR-1-SHP-1-CAMK1-CREB signaling pathway that inhibits apoptosis and differentiation of leukemia stem cells to retain the self-renewal capacity or ‘sternness’ of these cells (Kang et al., 2015 , Nat. Cell Biol. 17:665-677).
      Together, the accumulated data on LAIR-1 indicates an important role in immune homeostasis, however, there remains a need for compositions and methods of modulating LAIR-1 for the treatment of diseases and disorders. Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide compositions that increase LAIR-1 negative signaling and methods of use thereof for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and disorders and autoimmune diseases.
      It is also an object of the invention to provide compositions that reduce LAIR-1 negative signaling and methods of use thereof for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2701816,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
      The present invention relates to a preparation method of PCV2 capsid protein, particularly to a preparation method of PCV2 capsid protein by using a prokaryotic cell expression system.
Description of the Prior Art
      Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a viral pathogen that vastly affects the global swine industry. PCV2 mainly causes post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), whose symptoms are fever, lymphadenopathy, weight loss or weakness, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, body paleness, occasionally jaundice, etc. It may also cause porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), infectious congenital tremor (ICT), and reproductive disorders. In addition, infection of PCV2 in combination with other viral or bacterial pathogens causes porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). The disease caused by infection of PCV2 in pigs results in a decrease in the survival rate and feed conversion rate, leading to serious economic losses for pig producers.
      Twenty points of feeding and management for prevention and control of PCV2 in the field are proposed, such as all-in/all-out (AIAO), good hygiene management, elimination or segregation of pigs with severe illness, and vaccination. Among them, vaccination can effectively reduce the PCV2 infection rate and further increase the survival rate. PCV2 vaccines in the current field are divided into three categories, including inactivated PCV2 vaccines, inactivated baculovirus subunit vaccines, and inactivated PCV1-PCV2 chimeric virus vaccines (Beach And Meng, 2012; Chanhee, 2012).
      Inactivated PCV2 vaccine is produced by infecting porcine kidney cell line PK-15 with PCV2, harvesting the virus, inactivating the virus, and mixing the virus with adjuvant. For inactivated baculovirus subunit vaccines, insect cells are transfected with baculovirus carrying ORF2 gene encoding PCV2 capsid protein to express antigen ORF2. If the antigen is expressed in a cell, the vaccine is prepared by ultrasonically crushing the culture medium containing the cells, inactivating the virus, and mixing the virus with adjuvant. If the antigen is secreted into the extracellular milieu, the vaccine is prepared by collecting the cell culture supernatant, inactivating the virus, and mixing the virus with adjuvant. The inactivated PCV1-PCV2 chimeric virus vaccines is prepared by replacing PCV1 ORF2 with PCV2 ORF2, infecting cells, harvesting the virus, inactivating the virus, and mixing the virus with adjuvant.
      In view of the fact that the current PCV2 vaccine production methods are all based on the method of culturing viruses, these methods have the disadvantages of long preparation time and high production cost. To reduce the cost of PCV2 vaccines, researchers in the field tried to use recombinant E. coli with lower cost of culture for production of vaccine antigen ORF2. However, the method has issues of low production of ORF2, inability to form virus-like particles of the recombinant ORF2, complicated processes, or low immunity.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
201070053,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      All viruses must bind to and invade their target cells to replicate. For enveloped viruses, including RNA viruses having Class I membrane fusion proteins, the process involves (a) the binding of the virion to the target cell, (b) fusion of the envelope of the virus with the plasma membrane or an internal cellular membrane, (c) destabilization of the viral envelope and cellular membrane at the fused area to create a fusion pore, (d) transfer of the viral RNA through the pore, and (e) modification of cellular function by the viral RNA.
      Steps (b) and (c) above, which involve the fusion of the viral membrane and the cell envelope, are mediated by the interaction of a viral transmembrane glycoprotein (fusion protein) with surface proteins and membranes of the target cell. These interactions cause conformal changes in the fusion protein that result in the insertion of a viral fusion peptide into the target cell membrane. This insertion is followed by further conformational changes within the fusion protein that bring the viral envelope and cell membranes into close proximity and results in the fusion of the two membrane bilayers.
      A virus is unable to spread and propagate within its host if this fusion process is disrupted. Intentional disruption of this fusion process can be achieved by directing peptides and peptide mimics homologous to fusion protein sequences, antibodies that recognize the fusion protein, and other factors that act against the fusion protein.
      Hemagglutinin 2 (HA2) an envelope protein of the influenza virus, an orthomyxovirus, is the prototypic RNA virus Class I fusion protein. HA2 contains an amino terminal hydrophobic domain, referred to as the fusion peptide, that is exposed during cleavage of the hemagglutinin precursor protein. Retroviral transmembrane proteins contain several structural features in common with the known structure of HA2 in addition to the fusion peptide, including an extended amino-terminal helix (N-helix, usually a “heptad repeat” or “leucine zipper”), a carboxy-terminal helix (C-helix), and an aromatic motif proximal to the transmembrane domain. The presence of at least four out of these five domains define a viral envelope protein as a Class I fusion protein.
       FIG. 1 shows the five previously-described domains of the fusion proteins of the six families of Class I viruses. The fusion proteins originate in a hydrophobic fusion peptide, terminate in an anchor peptide, and incorporate an extended amino terminal alpha-helix (N-helix, usually a “heptade repeat” or “leucine zipper”), a carboxy-terminal alpha-helix (C-helix), and sometimes an aromatic motif proximal to the virion envelope. Also shown for each of the viral families is a sixth domain, referred to herein as the fusion initiation region (FIR), which was discovered by the present inventors and disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 10/578,013.
      About 10 to 20 percent of the population of the United States suffers from seasonal influenza each year. While most individuals recover from influenza in one to two weeks, the very young, the elderly, and persons with chronic medical conditions can develop post-flu pneumonia and other lethal complications. The causative agent of influenza is the influenza virus, an orthomyxovirus which readily develops new strains through a process of reassortment and mutation of the segmented viral genome.
      Highly virulent strains of type A influenza virus can produce epidemics and pandemics. In recent years, there has been an emergence of a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 capable of inflicting a high mortality rate. Because of the threat posed by the influenza virus both to public health and as a potential agent of bioterrorism, developing therapeutics to control seasonal influenza and the increasing threat of pandemic influenza is a high priority.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention provides peptides, peptide analogs, peptide derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions useful for treating or preventing influenza infections and/or preventing the person-to-person transmission of an influenza infection. A peptide of the invention comprises an influenza virus-cell fusion inhibiting portion of the fusion initiation region (FIR) of a wild-type influenza hemagglutinin 2 protein or a variant thereof. The variant differs from the wild-type protein by selected substitutions in the amino acid residue sequence of the wild-type hemagglutinin 2 protein sequence.
      In a first embodiment, an isolated peptide of the invention consists of 8 to 40 consecutive amino acid residues of a portion of a selected wild-type influenza hemagglutinin 2 protein or a variant thereof.

The portion also includes at least the sequence YNAELL (SEQ ID NO: 1) or a variant thereof that differs from SEQ ID NO: 1 by one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of Y1S, Y1T, Y1W, Y1A, N2Q, A3L, A3I, A3V, E4D, E4K, E4R, E4H, L5I, L5V, L5A, L6I, L6V, and L6A.
      In this first embodiment, the variant differs from the selected wild-type sequence by one or more amino acid substitutions in the amino acid sequence of the portion of the selected wild-type protein referred to above. The substitutions can be selected from corresponding amino acid residues of other wild-type influenza hemagglutinin 2 proteins or conservative substitutions of the wild-type residues, and preferably are selected so as to maintain a Wimley-White interfacial hydropathy profile for the variant having local maxima and local minima in the profile within about 5 amino acid residues of the local maxima and local minima of the Wimley-White interfacial hydropathy profile of the corresponding region of at least one wild-type hemagglutinin 2 amino acid sequence.

The substitutions in the variant are selected from corresponding amino acid residues of other wild-type hemagglutinin 2 proteins or conservative substitutions thereof, and preferably are selected to preserve the overall form of the Wimley-White hydropathy profile of the peptides i.e., to maintain a Wimley-White hydropathy profile for the variant having local maxima and local minima within about 5 amino acid residues of the local maxima and local minima of the Wimley-White hydropathy profile of the corresponding wild-type hemagglutinin 2 amino acid sequence. Preferably, the variants in this embodiment differ from the wild-type sequence by a conservative substitution.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2751953,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Various serotypes of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) are currently being utilized in clinical trials (e.g., rAAV1 for lipoprotein lipase deficiency, rAAV2 for Leber Congenital Amaurosis, rAAV8 for hemophilia). Of these, rAAV1 is considered the best for intramuscular (i.m.) delivery, whether treating muscle disorder directly (e.g., muscular dystrophy) or for conditions that can benefit from the secretion of a therapeutic protein into the bloodstream (e.g., α-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency). A major limitation of this approach has been sub therapeutic levels of transgene expression, despite the administration of high doses of rAAV. For example, while results from rAAV-AAT clinical trials demonstrate dose dependent increases in serum levels of AAT following i.m. injection, in high dose cohorts only ˜3% of target AAT expression was achieved. As this cohort required 100 i.m. injections of 1.35 mL each, increasing the dose to the degree necessary for disease correction may not be feasible. Similar observations have been documented for the recently approved rAAV1-based pharmaceutical, Glybera. For rAAV gene augmentation therapy to become a practical choice in cases such as these, improving transduction efficiency in muscle tissue is essential.
      Efforts towards increasing transgene expression can be divided into endogenous approaches, wherein the rAAV capsid and transgene themselves are modified to enhance transduction, and/or exogenous approaches, wherein supplementary therapeutics are delivered concurrent to rAAV administration. While exogenous approaches such as immune suppression have improved transduction, the process of integrating new discoveries of rAAV biology into clinical trial design has been the most successful tactic. This is best illustrated with the development of numerous naturally occurring AAV serotypes, and their preferential tissue transduction profiles. This enables correct pairing of AAV serotype to target organ (e.g., clinical trials utilizing i.m. delivery of rAAV became demonstrably more successful when rAAV1 was employed, as opposed to the historically utilized rAAV2). Additionally, serotype-comparative biological and structural analyses have facilitated directed evolution and rational engineering of rAAV, leading to the development of next generation translational vectors.
      The capsid structure of most common rAAV serotypes has been resolved. Each contains 60 repeating monomers, comprised of a conserved β-barrel core interspersed with large loops that form the topology of the capsid surface. By comparing the structures of rAAV2 and rAAV4, the least homologous serotypes, a total of nine variable regions (VRs; VRI to VRIX) were defined. The amino acid content of the VRs contributes distinct phenotypes to each serotype, such as receptor binding, antigenic reactivity and transduction efficiency. Comparing the VRs of rAAV2 (the prototypical rAAV) with more efficient muscle transducers, such as rAAV1, led to the first engineered rAAV capsid to enter clinical trial. rAAV2.5 consists of an rAAV2 capsid engrafted with five amino acids from rAAV1, isolated for their contribution to rAAV1's efficiency in muscle. Follow-up studies revealed that only a single amino acid change was needed to markedly enhance rAAV2 efficiency in muscle; namely, insertion of various amino acids following position 264, thereby creating a de novo position 265. Continued pre-clinical studies have suggested that the translatability of rAAV2 is limited by the superior efficiency of serotypes such as rAAV1 and rAAV6, as well as the high prevalence of rAAV2 neutralizing antibodies within the population. These “next generation” serotypes have been augmented further for efficient transduction by modulation of surface amino acids on the capsid backbone.
      As rAAV1 has become the top choice for musculoskeletal application, being used in 67% of i.m.-based clinical trials overall and 86% in the past 5 years, improving rAAV1 efficiency is timely to clinical translation. The present invention provides modified capsid proteins that have improved characteristics and are suitable for generating vectors with a wide variety of uses, including gene therapy.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      This study dissected rAAV capsid architecture to develop an engineering strategy designed to improve muscle transduction. Contrary to rAAV2 265 insertion mutants, the deletion of position 265 from the rAAV1 capsid provided the highest level of enhancement for both transgene delivery and expression in muscle tissue. Furthermore, through homology modeling and mutational analysis, two regions of the capsid were identified that appear to work together allosterically to control transduction efficiency in rAAV6 and rAAV2. The results provide a mechanism of regional destabilization in the VR1 loop due to the destruction of hydrogen bonding patterns. This discovery allowed for rational mutation of these additional serotypes in order to enhance transduction efficiency by at least an order of magnitude in each case. Furthermore, expression of the clinical AAT transgene in the chimera rAAV serotypes increased expression by up to 12.5-fold over parental rAAV1, supporting the use of these constructs in clinical trials. This study validates a rational design approach using structural modeling and molecular dissection of the rAAV capsid for improved delivery reagents better suited for translational studies.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2738833,"BACKGROUND
      Most small molecule drugs bind enzymes or receptors in tight and well-defined pockets. On the other hand, protein-protein interactions are notoriously difficult to target using small molecules due to their large contact surfaces and the shallow grooves or flat interfaces involved. E3 ubiquitin ligases (of which hundreds are known in humans) confer substrate specificity for ubiquitination, and therefore, are more attractive therapeutic targets than general proteasome inhibitors due to their specificity for certain protein substrates. The development of ligands of E3 ligases has proven challenging, in part due to the fact that they must disrupt protein-protein interactions. However, recent developments have provided specific ligands which bind to these ligases. For example, since the discovery of nutlins, the first small molecule E3 ligase inhibitors, additional compounds have been reported that target E3 ligases but the field remains underdeveloped.
      One E3 ligase with therapeutic potential is the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor. VHL comprises the substrate recognition subunit/E3 ligase complex VCB, which includes elongins B and C, and a complex including Cullin-2 and Rbx1. The primary substrate of VHL is Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1α (HIF-1α), a transcription factor that upregulates genes such as the pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF and the red blood cell inducing cytokine erythropoietin in response to low oxygen levels. We generated the first small molecule ligands of Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) to the substrate recognition subunit of the E3 ligase, VCB, an important target in cancer, chronic anemia and ischemia 2, and obtained crystal structures confirming that the compound mimics the binding mode of the transcription factor HIF-1α, the major substrate of VHL.
      Cereblon is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CRBN gene. CRBN orthologs are highly conserved from plants to humans, which underscores its physiological importance. Cereblon forms an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex with damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1), Cullin-4A (CUL4A), and regulator of cullins 1 (ROC1). This complex ubiquitinates a number of other proteins. Through a mechanism which has not been completely elucidated, cereblon ubquitination of target proteins results in increased levels of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10). FGF8 in turn regulates a number of developmental processes, such as limb and auditory vesicle formation. The net result is that this ubiquitin ligase complex is important for limb outgrowth in embryos. In the absence of cereblon, DDB1 forms a complex with DDB2 that functions as a DNA damage-binding protein.
      Thalidomide, which has been approved for the treatment of a number of immunological indications, has also been approved for the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases, including multiple myeloma. In addition to multiple myeloma, thalidomide and several of its analogs are also currently under investigation for use in treating a variety of other types of cancer. While the precise mechanism of thalidomide's anti-tumor activity is still emerging, it is known to inhibit angiogenesis. Recent literature discussing the biology of the imides includes Lu et al Science 343, 305 (2014) and Krönke et al Science 343, 301 (2014).
      Significantly, thalidomide and its analogs e.g. pomolinamiode and lenalinomide, are known to bind cereblon. These agents bind to cereblon, altering the specificity of the complex to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), transcription factors essential for multiple myeloma growth. Indeed, higher expression of cereblon has been linked to an increase in efficacy of imide drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
      An ongoing need exists in the art for effective treatments for disease, especially hyperplasias and cancers, such as multiple myeloma. However, non-specific effects, and the inability to target and modulate certain classes of proteins altogether, such as transcription factors, remain as obstacles to the development of effective anti-cancer agents. As such, small molecule therapeutic agents that leverage or potentiate cereblon's substrate specificity and, at the same time, are “tunable” such that a wide range of protein classes can be targetted and modulated with specificity would be very useful as a therapeutic.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200800050,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Many aspects of pharmaceutical production and formulation processes are pH sensitive. Maintaining the correct pH of a finished pharmaceutical product is critical to its stability, effectiveness, and shelf life, and pH is an important consideration in designing formulations for administration that will be acceptable, as well as safe and effective.
      To maintain pH, pharmaceutical processes and formulations use one or more buffering agents. A variety of buffering agents are available for pharmaceutical use. The buffer or buffers for a given application must be effective at the desired pH. They must also provide sufficient buffer capacity to maintain the desired pH for as long as necessary. A good buffer for a pharmaceutical composition must satisfy numerous other requirements as well. It must be appropriately soluble. It must not form deleterious complexes with metal ions, be toxic, or unduly penetrate, solubilize, or absorb on membranes or other surfaces. It should not interact with other components of the composition in any manner which decreases their availability or effectiveness. It must be stable and effective at maintaining pH over the range of conditions to which it will be exposed during formulation and during storage of the product. It must not be deleteriously affected by oxidation or other reactions occurring in its environment, such as those that occur in the processing of the composition in which it is providing the buffering action. If carried over or incorporated into a final product, a buffering agent must be safe for administration, compatible with other components of the composition over the shelf-life of the product, and acceptable for administration to the end user.
      Although there are many buffers in general use, only a limited number are suitable for biological applications and, of these, fewer still are acceptable for pharmaceutical processes and formulations. As a result, it often is challenging to find a buffer that not only will be effective at maintaining pH but also will meet all the other requirements for a given pharmaceutical process, formulation, or product.
      The challenge of finding a suitable buffer for pharmaceutical use can be especially acute for pharmaceutical proteins. The conformation and activity of proteins are critically dependent upon pH. Proteins are susceptible to a variety of pH sensitive reactions that are deleterious to their efficacy, typically many more than affect small molecule drugs. For instance, to mention just a few salient examples, the side chain amides of asparagine and glutamine are deamidated at low pH (less than 4.0) and also at neutral or high pH (greater than 6.0). Aspartic acid residues promote the hydrolysis of adjacent peptide bonds at low pH. The stability and disposition of disulfide bonds is highly dependent on pH, particularly in the presence of thiols. Solubility, flocculation, aggregation, precipitation, and fibrillation of proteins are critically dependent on pH. The crystal habit important to some pharmaceutical formulations also is critically dependent on pH. And pH is also an important factor in surface adsorption of many pharmaceutical peptides and proteins.
      Buffering agents that catalyze reactions that inactivate and/or degrade one or more other ingredients, moreover, cannot be used in pharmaceutical formulations. Buffers for pharmaceutical use must have not only the buffer capacity required to maintain correct pH, but also they must not buffer so strongly that their administration deleteriously perturbs a subject's physiological pH. Buffers for pharmaceutical formulations also must be compatible with typically complex formulation processes. For instance, buffers that sublime or evaporate, such as acetate and imidazole, generally cannot be relied upon to maintain pH during lyophilization and in the reconstituted lyophilization product. Other buffers that crystallize out of the protein amorphous phase, such as sodium phosphate, cannot be relied upon to maintain pH in processes that require freezing.
      Buffers used to maintain pH in pharmaceutical end-products also must be not only effective at maintaining pH but also safe and acceptable for administration to the subject. For instance, several otherwise useful buffers, such as citrate at low or high concentration and acetate at high concentration, are undesirably painful when administered parenterally.
      Some buffers have been found to be useful in the formulation of pharmaceutical proteins, such as acetate, succinate, citrate, histidine (imidazole), phosphate, and Tris. They all have undesirable limitations and disadvantages. And they all have the inherent disadvantage of being an additional ingredient in the formulation, which complicates the formulation process, poses a risk of deleteriously affecting other ingredients, stability, shelf-life, and acceptability to the end user.
      There is a need, therefore, for additional and improved methods of maintaining pH in the production and formulation of pharmaceuticals and in pharmaceutical compositions, particularly in the production and formulation of biopharmaceutical proteins and in biopharmaceutical protein compositions.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2689145,"BACKGROUND
      Proteins are complex molecules with defined primary, secondary, tertiary and in some cases quaternary structures, all of which play a role in imparting specific biological function. A variety of proteins, in particular antibodies, are available for pharmaceutical applications. However, these large, complex molecules are more difficult to formulate for administration to a subject than traditional organic and inorganic drugs. Structural complexity of biological pharmaceuticals, such as proteins renders them susceptible to various processes that result in structural and functional instability as well as loss of safety. For a protein to remain biologically active, a formulation must preserve the conformational integrity of at least a core sequence of the protein's amino acids while at the same time protecting the protein's multiple functional groups from degradation. With respect to these instability processes or degradation pathways, a protein can undergo a variety of covalent and non-covalent reactions or modifications in solution.
      Degradation pathways for proteins can involve chemical instability (i.e. any process which involves modification of the protein by bond formation or cleavage resulting in a new chemical entity) or physical instability (i.e. changes in the higher order structure of the protein). Chemical instability can result from deamidation, racemization, hydrolysis, oxidation, beta elimination or disulfide exchange. Physical instability can result from denaturation, aggregation, precipitation or adsorption, for example. The three most common protein degradation pathways are protein aggregation, deamidation and oxidation.
      Protein drugs are susceptible to the physical degradation process of irreversible aggregation. Protein aggregation is of particular interest in polypeptide production because it often results in diminished bioactivity that affects drug potency, and also can elicit serious immunological or antigenic reactions in patients. Chemical degradation of a protein therapeutic, including degradation of the chemical structure by, for example, chemical modification, also has been implicated in increasing its immunogenic potential.
      Long-term stability of a therapeutic protein is a particularly beneficial criterion for safe, consistent and efficacious treatments. Loss of functionality of the therapeutic within a preparation will decrease its effective concentration for a given administration. Similarly, undesired modifications of a therapeutic can affect the activity and/or the safety of a preparation, leading to loss of efficacy and risk of adverse side effects. Thus, stable protein formulations require that both physical and chemical degradation pathways of the drug be minimized.
      Many protein preparations intended for human use require stabilizers to prevent denaturation, aggregation and other alterations to the proteins prior to the use of the preparation. This instability is manifested in the formation of soluble/insoluble particles, and is often increased when the protein preparation is stored over time and during shipping. A major aim in the development of protein drug formulations is to maintain both protein solubility, stability and bioactivity.
      However, the use of excipients for one purpose such as stabilization can often lead to other unforeseen problems with compatibility of other components and the manufacture of the formulation. The following disclosure addresses this shortcoming of the art.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2769133,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Bispecific or multispecific antibodies have been generated in attempts to prepare molecules useful for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases, cancers, and other disorders.
      Bispecific antibodies have been produced using the quadroma technology (see Milstein, C. and A. C. Cuello, Nature, 1983. 305(5934): p. 537-40) based on the somatic fusion of two different hybridoma cell lines expressing murine monoclonal antibodies with the desired specificities of the bispecific antibody. Bispecific antibodies can also be produced by chemical conjugation of two different mAbs (see Staerz, U. D., et al., Nature, 1985. 314(6012): p. 628-31). Other approaches have used chemical conjugation of two different monoclonal antibodies or smaller antibody fragments (see Brennan, M., et al., Science, 1985. 229(4708): p. 81-3).
      Another method is the coupling of two parental antibodies with a hetero-bifunctional crosslinker. In particular, two different Fab fragments have been chemically crosslinked at their hinge cysteine residues in a site-directed manner (see Glennie, M. J., et al., J Immunol, 1987. 139(7): p. 2367-75).
      Other recombinant bispecific antibody formats have been developed in the recent past (see Kriangkum, J., et al., Biomol Eng, 2001. 18(2): p. 31-40). Amongst them tandem single-chain Fv molecules and diabodies, and various derivatives thereof, have been used for the construction of recombinant bispecific antibodies. Normally, construction of these molecules starts from two single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments that recognize different antigens (see Economides, A. N., et al., Nat Med, 2003. 9(1): p. 47-52). Tandem scFv molecules (taFv) represent a straightforward format simply connecting the two scFv molecules with an additional peptide linker. The two scFv fragments present in these tandem scFv molecules form separate folding entities. Various linkers can be used to connect the two scFv fragments and linkers with a length of up to 63 residues (see Nakanishi, K., et al Annu Rev Immunol, 2001. 19: p. 423-74).
      In a recent study, in vivo expression by transgenic rabbits and cattle of a tandem scFv directed against CD28 and a melanoma-associated proteoglycan was reported (see Gracie, J. A., et al., J Clin Invest, 1999. 104(10): p. 1393-401). In this construct the two scFv molecules were connected by a CH1 linker and serum concentrations of up to 100 mg/L of the bispecific antibody were found. A few studies have now reported expression of soluble tandem scFv molecules in bacteria (see Leung, B. P., et al., J Immunol, 2000. 164(12): p. 6495-502; Ito, A., et al., J Immunol, 2003. 170(9): p. 4802-9; Karni, A., et al., J Neuroimmunol, 2002. 125(1-2): p. 134-40) using either a very short Ala3 linker or long glycine/serine-rich linkers.
      In a recent study, phage display of a tandem scFv repertoire containing randomized middle linkers with a length of 3 or 6 residues enriched those molecules which are produced in soluble and active form in bacteria. This approach resulted in the isolation of a preferred tandem scFv molecule with a 6 amino acid residue linker (see Arndt, M. and J. Krauss, Methods Mol Biol, 2003. 207: p. 305-21).
      Bispecific diabodies (Db) utilize the diabody format for expression. Diabodies are produced from scFv fragments by reducing the length of the linker connecting the VH and VL domain to approximately 5 residues (see Peipp, M. and T. Valerius, Biochem Soc Trans, 2002. 30(4): p. 507-11). This reduction of linker size facilitates dimerization of two polypeptide chains by crossover pairing of the VH and VL domains. Bispecific diabodies are produced by expressing two polypeptide chains with either the structure VHA-VLB and VHB-VLA (VH-VL configuration) or VLA-VHB and VLB-VHA (VL-VH configuration) within the same cell. A recent comparative study demonstrates that the orientation of the variable domains can influence expression and formation of active binding sites (see Mack, M., G. Riethmuller, and P. Kufer, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1995. 92(15): p. 7021-5).
      One approach to force the generation of bispecific diabodies is the production of knob-into-hole diabodies (see Holliger, P., T. Prospero, and G. Winter, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1993. 90(14): p. 6444-8.18). This was demonstrated for a bispecific diabody directed against HER2 and CD3. A large knob was introduced in the VH domain by exchanging Val37 with Phe and Leu45 with Trp and a complementary hole was produced in the VL domain by mutating Phe98 to Met and Tyr87 to Ala, either in the anti-HER2 or the anti-CD3 variable domains. By using this approach the production of bispecific diabodies could be increased from 72% by the parental diabody to over 90% by the knob-into-hole diabody.
      Single-chain diabodies (scDb) represent an alternative strategy to improve the formation of bispecific diabody-like molecules (see Holliger, P. and G. Winter, Cancer Immunol Immunother, 1997. 45(3-4): p. 128-30; Wu, A. M., et al., Immunotechnology, 1996. 2(1): p. 21-36). Bispecific single-chain diabodies are produced by connecting the two diabody-forming polypeptide chains with an additional middle linker with a length of approximately 15 amino acid residues. Consequently, all molecules with a molecular weight corresponding to monomeric single-chain diabodies (50-60 kDa) are bispecific. Several studies have demonstrated that bispecific single chain diabodies are expressed in bacteria in soluble and active form with the majority of purified molecules present as monomers (see Holliger, P. and G. Winter, Cancer Immunol Immunother, 1997. 45(3-4): p. 128-30; Wu, A. M., et al., Immunotechnology, 1996. 2(1): p. 21-36; Pluckthun, A. and P. Pack, Immunotechnology, 1997. 3(2): p. 83-105; Ridgway, J. B., et al., Protein Eng, 1996. 9(7): p. 617-21).
      Diabody have been fused to Fc to generate more Ig-like molecules, named di-diabody (see Lu, D., et al., J Biol Chem, 2004. 279(4): p. 2856-65). In addition, multivalent antibody construct comprising two Fab repeats in the heavy chain of an IgG and capable of binding four antigen molecules has been described (see U.S. Pat.

      There is a need in the art for single molecular entities with dual antigen binding function, and for methods of generating such multivalent and multispecific binding proteins. The present invention addresses these and other needs.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2660580,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Regulatory T-cells (Treg cells; also known as suppressor T-cells) are subpopulations of T-cells that maintain immune homeostasis and help avert autoimmune disease (Sakaguchi et al., 2008; Shevach, 2006; Vignali et al., 2008). Interest in Treg cells is focused predominantly on prototypic CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells that are programmed by the transcription factor FoxP3 (Fontenot et al., 2003; Hori et al., 2003). In resting polyspecific populations these Treg cells are characterised in the mouse both as ‘natural’, thymus-derived and induced ‘adaptive’ cells that suppress the activation, proliferation and functions of other T-cells (Sakaguchi et al., 2008; Shevach, 2006). However, in human blood CD4 + Treg cells are not as reliably distinguished by FoxP3 expression (Roncarolo and Gregori, 2008; Allan et al., 2007; Gavin et al., 2006). Thus, CD4 + T-cells with markers of either naïve or memory cells were shown to have similar suppressor functions despite low and high expression, respectively, of FoxP3 (Miyara et al., 2009). Other surface markers of human CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cells such as decreased expression of the IL-7 receptor, CD127 (Liu et al., 2006; Seddiki et al., 2006), are not specific for Treg cells.
      Aside from the paucity of specific cell surface markers, the mechanisms underlying suppression by CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Treg cells remain controversial. In the mouse, suppression ex vivo has been shown to require cell-cell contact but has been attributed to multiple mechanisms (Vignali et al., 2008; Shevach, 2009; Sakaguchi et al., 2009); even less is known about the function of similar human Treg cells. Furthermore, other types of both CD4 + and CD8 + Treg cells that differ in proposed mechanisms of suppressor function have been described in the context of various tissue sites or diseases (Vignali et al., 2008).
      Treg cells induced by administration of autoantigens have been shown to protect against some autoimmune diseases in certain animal models (reviewed by von Herrath and Harrison, 2003). For example, in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes (T1D) CD4 + Treg cells induced by administered pancreatic islet autoantigens such as insulin (Bergerot et al., 1994) or glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) (Tisch et al., 1999), or transfer of CD4 + Treg cells induced by proinsulin (Every et al., 2006) or a putative pancreatic islet antigen (Tang et al., 2004), have been shown to protect against autoimmune diabetes. However, in these models Treg cells have been studied in resting, polyspecific populations and not during the host's response to a particular antigen. Recently, proinsulin- and GAD65-specific human CD4 + T-cell clones were generated and Treg clones were distinguished by their suppressor function in vitro (Dromey et al., 2011). The cell surface membrane-anchored glycoprotein CD52 was shown to be upregulated in these expanded CD4 + Treg clones. However, the mechanism of immune suppression has not previously been characterized.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2607038,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      In the last two decades various engineered antibody derivatives, either mono or- multispecific, either mono- or multivalent have been developed and evaluated (see e.g. Holliger, P., et al., Nature Biotech. 23 (2005) 1126-1136; Fischer, N., and Léger O., Pathobiology 74 (2007) 3-14).
      US 2004/0033561 refers to the DNA and the production of monovalent monobodies by co-expression of a heavy chain and a modified heavy chain. However during expression a considerably amount of undesired homodimer is formed as by-product, which is difficult to separate from the desired heterodimeric monobodies, as the homodimer and the heterodimer have the same or similar molecular weights. WO 2007/048037 refers to monovalent IgGs which corresponds to the heterodimeric monobodies of US 2004/0033561, but which can have a tagging moiety attached to the heavy chain for easier purification of the heterodimer from the difficult-to-separate homodimeric by-product.

       FIGS. 1A and B: A) Schematic structure of the antigen binding protein according to the invention (abbreviated MoAb-Dimer) with CH1-CL crossover. B) Scheme of the major byproduct-monovalent antibody monomer (MoAb) with CH1-CL crossover (abbreviated MoAb).
       FIG. 1C: C) Association of two modified heavy chains a and b: Heterodimerisation of two different chains (a with b) directly leads to the monovalent antibody B (route 2). Homodimerisation of two identical chains (a with a and b with b) leads to the putative intermediates aa and bb (via route 1) that can associate to form “MoAb-Dimer” A. Modification of the CH3-CH3 contacts may affect distribution of products A (MoAb-Dimer) and B (MoAb). Modifications that favor heterodimerisation (e.g. knobs into holes) will increase the relative amount of compound B via route 2, whereas modifications that maintain attractive interactions between identical chains but lead to repulsion of different chains (e.g. CH3 domains of a and b taken from different isotypes) will favor route 1 and thus increase the amount of A.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
201100210,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Diabetes mellitus is a serious disease afflicting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, there are more than 12 million diabetics, with 600,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Diabetes mellitus is a diagnostic term for a group of disorders characterized by abnormal glucose homeostasis resulting in elevated blood sugar. There are many types of diabetes, but the two most common are Type 1 (also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or IDDM) and Type 2 (also referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or NIDDM).
      The etiology of the different types of diabetes is not the same; however, everyone with diabetes has two things in common: overproduction of glucose by the liver and little or no ability to move glucose out of the blood into the cells where it becomes the body's primary fuel.
      People who do not have diabetes rely on insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas, to move glucose from the blood into the cells of the body. However, people who have diabetes either do not produce insulin or cannot efficiently use the insulin they produce; therefore, they cannot move glucose into their cells. Glucose accumulates in the blood creating a condition called hyperglycemia, and over time, can cause serious health problems.
      Diabetes is a syndrome with interrelated metabolic, vascular, and neuropathic components. The metabolic syndrome, generally characterized by hyperglycemia, comprises alterations in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism caused by absent or markedly reduced insulin secretion and/or ineffective insulin action. The vascular syndrome consists of abnormalities in the blood vessels leading to cardiovascular, retinal and renal complications. Abnormalities in the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems are also part of the diabetic syndrome.
      Diabetes has also been implicated in the development of kidney disease, eye diseases and nervous-system problems. Kidney disease, also called nephropathy, occurs when the kidney's “filter mechanism” is damaged and protein leaks into urine in excessive amounts and eventually the kidney fails. Diabetes is also a leading cause of damage to the retina at the back of the eye and increases risk of cataracts and glaucoma. Finally, diabetes is associated with nerve damage, especially in the legs and feet, which interferes with the ability to sense pain and contributes to serious infections. Taken together, diabetes complications are one of the nation's leading causes of death.
      Many people with NIDDM have sedentary lifestyles and are obese; they weigh approximately 20% more than the recommended weight for their height and build. Furthermore, obesity is characterized by hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, a feature shared with NIDDM, hypertension and atherosclerosis.
      Obesity, which is the result of an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, is highly correlated with insulin resistance and diabetes in experimental animals and human. However, the molecular mechanisms that are involved in obesity-diabetes syndromes are not clear. During early development of obesity, increased insulin secretion balances insulin resistance and protects patients from hyperglycemia (Le Stunff et al., Diabetes, 43:696-702 (1989)). However, over time, β-cell function deteriorates and non-insulin-dependent diabetes develops in about 20% of the obese population (Pederson, P., Diab. Metab. Rev., 5:505-509 (1989)) and (Brancati, F. L. et al., Arch. Intern. Med., 159:957-963 (1999)). Given its high prevalence in modern societies, obesity has thus become the leading risk factor for NIDDM (Hill, J. O. et al., Science, 280:1371-1374 (1998)). However, the factors which predispose a fraction of patients to alteration of insulin secretion in response to fat accumulation remain unknown. The most common diseases with obesity are cardiovascular disease (particularly hypertension), diabetes (obesity aggravates the development of diabetes), gall bladder disease (particularly cancer) and diseases of reproduction. Research has shown that even a modest reduction in body weight can correspond to a significant reduction in the risk of developing coronary heart disease.
      Obesity considerably increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well. Coronary insufficiency, atheromatous disease, and cardiac insufficiency are at the forefront of the cardiovascular complication induced by obesity. It is estimated that if the entire population had an ideal weight, the risk of coronary insufficiency would decrease by 25% and the risk of cardiac insufficiency and of cerebral vascular accidents by 35%. The incidence of coronary diseases is doubled in subjects less than 50 years of age who are 30% overweight. The diabetes patient faces a 30% reduced lifespan. After age 45, people with diabetes are about three times more likely than people without diabetes to have significant heart disease and up to five times more likely to have a stroke. These findings emphasize the inter-relations between risks factors for NIDDM, obesity and coronary heart disease as well as the potential value of an integrated approach involving the treatment of both obesity and diabetes (Perry, I. J. et al., BMJ, 310:560-564 (1995)).
      Type 2 diabetes results from the progressive loss of pancreatic β-cell function in the presence of insulin resistance, leading to an overall reduction in insulin output (Prentki, M. et al., “Islet failure in type 2 diabetes”, J. Clin. Invest., 116:1802-1812 (2006)). β-cells are the cell type that store and release insulin in response to an elevation in plasma glucose or in response to hormonal signals from the gut following the ingestion of food. Evidence suggests that in type 2 diabetics the rate of β-cell cell death (apoptosis) exceeds that of new β-cell development, yielding an overall loss in β-cell number (Butler, A. E. et al., “β-cell deficit and increased β-cellapoptosis in humans with type 2 diabetes”, Diabetes, 52:102-110 (2003)). β-cell apoptosis may arise from persistent elevations in plasma glucose levels (glucotoxicity) and/or plasma lipid levels (lipotoxicity).
      G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed on β-cells are known to modulate the release of insulin in response to changes in plasma glucose levels (Ahren, B., “Autonomic regulation of islet hormone secretion—Implications for health and disease”, Diabetologia, 43:393-410 (2003)). Those GPCRs specifically coupled to the elevation of cAMP via the G s alpha subunit of G-protein, have been shown to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin release from β-cells. Cyclic AMP-stimulating GPCRs on β-cells include the GLP-1, GIP, β2-adrenergic receptors and GPR119. Increasing cAMP concentration in β-cells is known to lead to the activation of PKA which is thought to prevent the opening of potassium channels on the surface of the β-cell. The reduction in K + efflux depolarizes the β-cell leading to an influx of Ca ++ which promotes the release of insulin.
      GPR119 (e.g., human GPR119, GENBANK® Accession No. AAP72125 and alleles thereof; e.g., mouse GPR119, GENBANK® Accession No. AY288423 and alleles thereof) is a GPCR located at chromosome position Xp26.1 (Fredricksson, R. et al., “Seven evolutionarily conserved human rhodopsin G protein-coupled receptors lacking close relatives”, FEBS Lett., 554:381-388 (2003)). The receptor is coupled to Gs, and when stimulated, produces an elevation in cAMP in a variety of cell types including β-cell-derived insulinomas (Soga, T. et al., “Lysophosphatidylcholine enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion via an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor”, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 326:744-751 (2005), international patent applications WO 04/065380, WO 04/076413, WO 05/007647, WO 05/007658, WO 05/121121, WO 06/083491 and EP 1338651). The receptor has been shown to be localized to the β-cells of the pancreas in a number of species as well as in specific cell types of the gastrointestinal tract. Activation of GPR119, with agonist ligands such as lysophosphatidylcholine, produce a glucose dependent increase in insulin secretion from primary mouse islets and various insulinoma cell lines such as NIT-1 and HIT-T15 (Soga, T. et al., “Lysophosphatidylcholine enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion via an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor”, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 326:744-751 (2005); Chu, Z. L. et al., “A role for β-cell-expressed GPR119 in glycemic control by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin release”, Endocrinology, doi:10.1210/en.2006-1608 (2007)).
      When activators of GPR119 are administered to either normal mice or mice that are prone to diabetes due to genetic mutation, prior to an oral glucose tolerance test, improvements in glucose tolerance are observed. A short-lived increase in plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 and plasma insulin levels are also observed in these treated animals (Chu, Z. L. et al., “A role for β-cell-expressed GPR119 in glycemic control by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin release”, Endocrinology, doi:10.1210/en.2006-1608 (2007)). In addition to effects on plasma glucose levels, GPR119 activators have also been demonstrated to produce reductions in acute food intake and to reduce body weight in rats following chronic administration (Overton, H. A. et al., “Deorphanization of a G protein-coupled receptor for oleoylethanolamide and its use in the discovery of small-molecule hypophagic agents”, Cell Metabolism, 3:167-175 (2006), and international patent applications WO 05/007647 and WO 05/007658).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2433141,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The process of lymphocyte development and differentiation is tightly controlled by cytokines. B lymphocyte stimulating factors (BLyS, also called BAFF, TNSF13B, THANK, TALL-1, and zTNF4) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) belong to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamilies that play a critical role in the survival and death of immune cells (Schneider, 2005, Current opinion in immunology, 17:282-289; Seyler et al., 2005, The Journal of Clinical investigation, 115:3083-3092). They provide key signals for the development and proliferation of B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. In addition, they suppress lymphocyte apoptosis and stimulate the production of immunoglobulins in the blood (Wang et al., 2001, Nature Immunology, 2:632-637).
      The over-expression of BLyS and APRIL, however, are associated with many lymphoproliferative disorders, as well as immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases. These conditions include, for example, chronic lymphocyte leukemia, multiple myeloma, B lymphocyte lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and sicca syndrome. Further, clinical studies have shown that the degree of BLyS and APRIL over-expression correlates to the severity of diseases.
      BLyS and APRIL regulate immune responses through binding to their receptors on the cell surface. Their pro-survival function is mainly regulated through the binding of BLyS to BAFF-R and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and/or APRIL to BCMA.
      In contrast, transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) function at least in part as a negative regulator of BLyS and APRIL activity. TACI has an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular domain, wherein the extracellular domain includes an amino terminal region, a cystein-rich region and a stalk region. Because the cystein-rich region has high affinity to both BLyS and APRIL, the expression of TACT inhibits the pro-survival signaling pathway by blocking the binding of BLyS and APRIL to BAFF-R and/or BCMA.
      Pre-clinical studies have shown that TACI or TACI-fusion proteins are useful for treating or ameliorating pathological immune conditions such as lymphoproliferative disorders, and autoimmune diseases.
      Proprotein convertase (PC) is a group of enzymes that cleave proteins at specific sites. For many secretory protein or peptides, PC cleavage is a part of normal protein post-translational modification process for protein maturation or activation. For other proteins or polypeptides, the existing of PC cleavage sites within protein sequences may cause undesired protein cleavage. When the TACI sequence is analyzed by using the proprotein convertase (PC) artificial neural network computer program, a number of PC cleavage sites can be identified. PC cleavage at various sites results in TACI proteins that are heterogeneous in size, structure, stability, and activity. This enzymatic cleavage process also generates unwanted protein products.
      To address this problem, PCT/US2002/015910 provides a method for avoiding PC cleavage by constructing a TACI-Fc fusion protein having no amino terminal region and only part of the stalk region. However, it is reported that the TACI-Fc fusion protein with no amino terminal region exhibits significantly reduced biological activity (Wu et al., 2000, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 275:35478-35485). Consequently, there remains a substantial need for improved TACI-Fc fusion proteins that not only possess high binding affinity to BLyS and/or APRIL, but also exhibit biological activity similar to the native TACI protein. In addition, a need exists for improved methods of recombinant production of TACI proteins that are capable of yielding homogeneous biologically-active TACI protein products with lot-to-lot consistency.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2664464,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; human HER2 has the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot number P04626) also known as ErbB2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ERBB2 gene. Amplification or over-expression of this gene has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of certain types of cancer and in recent years it has evolved to become an important biomarker and target of disease therapy. HER2 is a trans-membrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) belonging to the wider family of ErbB receptors (Bublil, E. M. and Yarden, Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 19(2), 124-34, 2007). The ErbB receptor family is conserved across vertebrates and also includes the family founder ErbB1 (also named epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or HER1; P00533 number in UniProKB/Swiss-Prot for the human protein) and the more recently identified receptors HER3 (also named ErbB3; P21860 number in UniProKB/Swiss-Prot for the human protein) and HER4 (also named ErbB4; Q15303 number in UniProKB/Swiss-Prot for the human protein). All ErbB receptors share extensive sequence and domain homologies, and form functional homodimers (e.g. ErbB1-ErbB1, HER2-HER2 and HER4-HER4) and heterodimers in all combinations. Receptor homo- and heterodimerization occurs upon ligand binding or receptor overexpression, and in turn activates intracellular receptor kinase domains by autophosphorylation. This then triggers downstream intracellular signaling and biological responses. In contrast to the other ErbB-receptors, HER2 does not have any known ligand and is able to dimerize, which is strongly pronounced after its overexpression and is thereby activated without previous ligand binding. Importantly, HER3 has no active intracellular kinase domain and is activated through heterodimerization with other ErbB receptor family members leading to very potent downstream signaling. Such heterodimerization and activation of HER3 occurs upon ligand binding to HER3 or if a partnering receptor, such as HER2, is strongly overexpressed.
      HER2 as well as all the other ErbB receptor family members are composed of four extracellular domains, which are sequentially named I, II, III and IV; where domain IV is the closest to the extracellular cell membrane and domain I the most distal. In ligand-deprived conditions, domains I and III in ErbB receptors share an intramolecular interaction that occludes domain II. This prevents receptor homo-/heterodimerization and signaling, since interaction between domains II of two neighboring ErbB receptors is required for dimerization (Burguess A. W., et al., Mol. Cell 12(3), 541-552, 2003). Ligand binding disrupts the interaction between domains I and III, which then causes a tethered-to-extended receptor conformational change and leaves domain II exposed. This makes the receptor promiscuous to dimerize with other extended ErbB receptors and initiate signaling. Interestingly, HER2 is the only ErbB receptor family member that is constitutively found in an extended conformation; hence domain II is continuously exposed and accessible for homo- and heterodimerization.
      ErbB receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation leads to the activation of a plethora of key downstream signaling molecules involved in normal physiology as well as in disease. The nature of such activated signaling molecules depends to some extend on the composition of the active ErbB receptor dimers. For instance, HER1-HER1 and HER2-HER2 homodimers preferentially activate downstream extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and proliferation, whereas HER2-HER3 heterodimers also activate the PI3K-signaling pathway (including activation of the downstream kinase AKT) and thereby cell survival. In fact, AKT activation by HER2-HER3 signaling in tumor cells promotes survival and makes tumor cells resistant to HER2 targeting drugs, such as the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Berns K. et al., Cancer Cell 12, 395-402, 2007). Interestingly, inhibition of HER2-HER3 mediated PI3K-AKT signaling in these cells becomes rate-limiting and results in cell death. Apart from cell proliferation and survival, HER2 signaling has been also causally involved in other processes such as angiogenesis and migration.
      HER2 is overexpressed in approximately 20% of all breast cancers. Due to its clinical relevance, HER2 became the first RTK against which a targeted biological was developed, namely trastuzumab (Herceptin®; Genentech). This antibody binds to domain IV of HER2 and inhibits HER2 signaling by several mechanisms that are not yet completely understood. These include induction of receptor internalization in tumor cells, which results in reduced HER2 expression levels and signaling and leads to an attenuated tumorigenic phenotype. Trastuzumab has changed the life of tens of thousands of breast cancer women, expanding their lifetime and quality of life. However, trastuzumab has mainly an anti-proliferative effect and tumors may escape from such treatment in advanced disease stages. In an attempt to develop more efficacious treatments, a new antibody was generated that recognized domain II or HER2, namely pertuzumab (Omnitarg®, Perjeta®; Genentech). In contrast to trastuzumab, this antibody was not developed to reduce the membrane expression levels of HER2, but to interfere with HER2 homo- and heterodimer formation by binding to and occluding the dimerization domain II of the receptor. Pertuzumab treatment has an unexpected low therapeutic efficacy in vitro and in vivo as single agent; nevertheless, its combination with trastuzumab shows synergistic effects. Therefore, the combination of both antibodies may become a standard of care therapy for breast cancer patients (Capelan M., et al., Ann. Oncol., 24, 273-82, 2013).
      The preclinical and clinical success of the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab has led to the concept that dual targeting of domains II and IV in HER2 is required for superior anti-tumor efficacy. This is aligned with other molecules more recently generated to simultaneously target HER2 on domains II and IV. For instance, the Danish company Symphogen is developing antibody mixes against domains II and IV of HER2 that have shown some higher efficacy (i.e. superior to trastuzumab alone) in preclinical mouse tumor models.
      Similarly, US2011/033460 describes that the combination of antibodies that bind domain I and domain IV of HER2 exhibits synergistic effects on DNA synthesis and viability of BT474 cells. Furthermore, US2011/033460 also describes bispecific antibodies that bind two different epitopes of HER2, one epitope located on domain I of HER2 and the other epitope located on domain IV of HER2.
      WO 2009/068625 covers the development of biparatopic antibody constructs comprising a first antibody domain, which competes with trastuzumab for binding to HER2, and a second antibody domain, which binds to a different epitope or part of HER2. Interestingly, some constructs had an antagonistic effect of SKBR3 cell proliferation, whereas others had an agonistic effect. Especially, WO 2009/068625 covers the development of biparatopic antibody constructs comprising a first antibody domain, which competes with trastuzumab for binding to HER2 (i.e. binding domain IV of Her2) and a second antibody domain, which competes with pertuzumab for binding to HER2 (i.e. binding domain II of HER2). Constructs where the domain IV binding antibody domain was cloned N-terminally to the domain II binding antibody domain showed blocking of map kinase activation, whereas such a blocking was not observed with the other orientation (i.e., having the domain II binding antibody domain at the N-terminus). Overall, WO 2009/068625 describes a variety of biparatopic antibody constructs targeting HER2, which have to variable extends effects on SKBR3 cell proliferation (agonistic or antagonistic) or cell signaling, but no cytotoxic nor apoptotic effects were described.
      Bivalent binding proteins, such as bivalent diabody molecules or bivalent affibodies targeting HER2, are described also (Nielsen, U. B., et al., Cancer Res., 60, 6434-6440, 2000; Steffen, A-C., Cancer Biother. Radiopharmaceut. 20, 239-248, 2005). Such molecules combine two times the same binding domain and thus are different to biparatopic molecules that comprise two binding domains each of which binds to a different epitope on the same target molecule.
      As an alternative to antibody-derived therapeutics and SMIs, there are novel binding proteins or binding domains that can be used to specifically bind a target molecule (e.g. Binz, H. K., Amstutz, P. and Plückthun, A., Nat. Biotechnol. 23, 1257-1268, 2005) and thereby act as an antagonist. One such novel class of binding proteins or binding domains not possessing an Fc are based on designed repeat proteins or designed repeat domains (WO 2002/020565; Binz, H. K., Amstutz, P., Kohl, A., Stumpp, M. T., Briand, C., Forrer, P., Grütter, M. G., and Plückthun, A., Nat. Biotechnol. 22, 575-582, 2004; Stumpp, M. T., Binz, H. K and Amstutz, P., Drug Discov. Today 13, 695-701, 2008).
      WO 2002/020565 describes how large libraries of repeat proteins can be constructed and their general application. Such designed repeat domains harness the modular nature of repeat proteins and may possess N-terminal and C-terminal capping modules to prevent the designed repeat domains from aggregation by shielding the hydrophobic core of the domain (Forrer, P., Stumpp, M. T., Binz, H. K. and Plückthun, A., FEBS letters 539, 2-6, 2003). This novel class of binding proteins includes designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). The generation of monospecific DARPins binding to HER2 were previously described (e.g. Steiner, D., Forrer, P. and Plückthun, A., J. Mol. Biol. 382, 1211-1227, 2008; Zahnd, C., Pecorari, F., Straumann, N., Wyler, E. and Plückthun, A., J. Biol. Chem. 281(46), 35167-35175, 2006).
      Recently, a bispecific designed ankyrin repeat protein was described, which targets HER2 (Jost, Ch., et al., Structure 21, 1-13, 2013). The authors show that binding of two ankyrin repeat domains connected by a short linker (longer linkers do not work as well), one targeting domain I of Her2 and the other domain IV of Her2, causes stronger cytotoxic effects on BT474 cells as compared to trastuzumab alone, which targets domain IV of Her2. This biparatopic repeat protein works by intra-molecular cross-linking of two Her2 molecules; i.e., it connects two membrane-bound HER2 molecules, distorting them such that they cannot form signaling-competent dimers with any EGFR family member, preventing any kinase dimerization, and thus leading to the observed cytotoxic effects.
      Even though the prior art indicates that targeting of HER2 is beneficial for the therapy of diseases, such as cancer, there is a clear need to generate binding proteins targeting HER2 with higher efficacy.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2497830,"BACKGROUND
      The present invention relates to the fields of protein engineering, plant molecular biology and pest control. More particularly the invention relates to novel engineered hybrid proteins having insecticidal activity, nucleic acids whose expression results in the insecticidal proteins, and methods of making and methods of using the insecticidal proteins and corresponding nucleic acids to control insects.
      Insect pests are a major cause of crop losses. In the US alone, billions of dollars are lost every year due to infestation by various genera of insects. In addition to losses in field crops, insect pests are also a burden to vegetable and fruit growers, to producers of ornamental flowers, and they are a nuisance to gardeners and homeowners.
      Species of corn rootworm are considered to be the most destructive corn pests. In the United States, the three important species are Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, the western corm rootworm, D. longicornis barberi, the northern corn rootworm and D. udecimpunctata howardi, the southern corn rootworm. Only western and northern corn rootworms are considered primary pests of corn in the US Corn Belt. An important corn rootworm pest in the Southern US is the Mexican corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera zeae. Corn rootworm larvae cause the most substantial plant damage by feeding almost exclusively on corn roots. This injury has been shown to increase plant lodging, to reduce grain yield and vegetative yield as well as alter the nutrient content of the grain. Larval feeding also causes indirect effects on corn by opening avenues through the roots for bacterial and fungal infections which lead to root and stalk rot diseases. Adult corn rootworms are active in cornfields in late summer where they feed on ears, silks and pollen, thus interfering with normal pollination.
      Corn rootworms are mainly controlled by intensive applications of chemical pesticides, which are active through inhibition of insect growth, prevention of insect feeding or reproduction, or cause death. Good corn rootworm control can thus be reached, but these chemicals can sometimes also affect other, beneficial organisms. Another problem resulting from the wide use of chemical pesticides is the appearance of resistant insect varieties. Yet another problem is due to the fact that corn rootworm larvae feed underground thus making it difficult to apply rescue treatments of insecticides. Therefore, most insecticide applications are madeprophylactiealiy at the time of planting. This practice results in a large environmental harden. This has been partially alleviated by various farm management practices, but there is an increasing need for alternative pest control mechanisms.
      Biological pest control agents, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strains expressing pesticidal toxins like δ-endotoxins (delta-endotoxins; also called crystal toxins or Cry proteins), have also been applied to crop plants with satisfactory results against primarily lepidopteran insect pests. The δ-endotoxins are proteins held within a crystalline matrix that are known to possess insecticidal activity when ingested by certain insects. The various δ-endotoxins have been classified based upon their spectrum of activity and sequence homology. Prior to 1990, the major classes were defined by their spectrum of activity with the Cry1 proteins active against Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies), Cry2 proteins active against both Lepidoptera and Diptera (flies and mosquitoes), Cry3 proteins active against Coleoptera (beetles) and Cry4 proteins active against Diptera (Hofte & Whitely, 1989, Microbiol. Rev. 53:242-255). A new nomenclature was developed in 1998 which systematically classifies the Cry proteins based on amino acid sequence homology rather than insect target specificities (Crickmore et al 1998, Microbiol. Molec. Biol. Rev. 62:807-813).
      The spectrum of insecticidal activity of an individual δ-endotoxin from Bt is quite narrow, with a given δ-endotoxin being active against only a few species within an Order. For instance, a Cry3A toxin is known to be very toxic to die Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, but has very little or no toxicity to related beetles in the genus Diabrotica (Johnson et al., 1993, J. Econ. Entomol. 86:330-333). According to Slaney et al (1992, Insect Biochem. Molec. Biol. 22:9-1.8) a Cry3A toxin is at least 2000 times less toxic to southern corn rootworm larvae than to the Colorado potato beetle. It is also known that Cry3A has little or no toxicity to the western corn rootworm or northern corn rootworm.
      Specificity of the δ-endotoxins is the result of the efficiency of the various steps involved in producing an active toxic protein and its subsequent interaction with the epithelial cells in an insect mid-gut. To be insecticidal, most known δ-endotoxins must first be ingested by the insect and proteolytically activated to form an active toxin. Activation of the insecticidal crystal (Cry) proteins is a multi-step process. After ingestion, the crystals must first be solubilized in the insect gut. Once solubilized, the δ-endotoxins are activated by specific proteolytic cleavages. The proteases in the insect gut can play a role in specificity by determining where the δ-endotoxin is processed. Once the δ-endotoxin has been solubilized and processed it binds to specific receptors on the surface of the insects' mid-gut epithelium and subsequently integrates into the lipid bilayer of the brush border membrane. Ion channels then form disrupting the normal function of the midgut eventually leading to the death of the insect.
      In Lepidoptera, which have alkaline pH guts, gut proteases process δ-endotoxins for example, Cry1Aa, Cry 1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1B and Cry1F, from 130-140 kDa protoxins to toxic proteins of approximately 60-70 kDa, Processing of the protoxin to toxin has been reported to proceed by removal of both N- and C-terminal amino acids with the exact location of processing being dependent on the specific δ-endotoxin and the specific insect gut fluids involved (Ogiwara et al., 1992, J. Invert. Pathol. 60:121-126). Thus activation requires that the entire C-terminal protoxin tail region be cleaved off. This proteolytic activation of a δ-endotoxin can play a significant role in determining its specificity.
      Coleopteran insects have guts that are more neutral to acidic and coleopteran-specific δ-endotoxins are similar to the size of the activated lepidopteran-specific toxins. Therefore, the processing of coleopteran-specific δ-endotoxins was formerly considered unnecessary for toxicity. However, data suggests that coleopteran-active δ-endotoxins are solubilized and proteolyzed to smaller toxic polypeptides. A 73 kDa Cry3A δ-endotoxin protein produced by B. thuringiensis var. tenebrionis is readily processed in the bacterium at the N-terminus, losing 49-57 residues during or after crystal formation to produce the commonly isolated 67 kDa form (Carroll et al., 1989, Biochem. J. 261:99-1.05). McPherson et al., (1988, Biotechnology 6:61-66) also demonstrated that a native cry3A coding sequence contains two functional translational initiation codons in the same reading frame, one coding for a 73 kDa protein and the other coding for a 67 kDa protein starting at Met-1 and Met-48 respectively, of the deduced amino acid sequence. Both proteins then can be considered naturally occurring full-length Cry3A proteins.
      As more knowledge has been gained as to how the δ-endotoxins function, attempts to engineer δ-endotoxins to have new activities have increased. Engineering δ-endotoxins was made more possible by solving the three dimensional structure of Cry3A in 1991 (Li et al., 1991, Nature 353:815-821). Li et al. determined that a Cry3A protein has three structural domains: die N-terminal domain I, from residues 58-290, consists of 7α-helices, domain II, from residues 291-500, contains three β-sheets in a so-called Greek key-conformation, and the C-terminal domain III, from residues 501-644, is a β-sandwich in a so-called jellyroll conformation. The three dimensional structure for the lepidopteran active Cry1Aa toxin has also been solved (Grochulski et al., 1995, J. Mol. Biol. 254:447-464). The Cry1Aa toxin also has three domains: the N-terminal domain I, from residues 33-253, domain II from residues 265-461, and domain III from residues 463-609 with an additional outer strand in one of the β-sheets from by residues 254-264. If the Cry3A and Cry1Aa structures are projected on other Cry1 sequences, domain I runs from about amino acid residue 28 to 260, domain II from about 260 to 460 and domain III from about 460 to 600. See, Nakamura et al., Agric. Biol. Chem. 54(3): 715-724 (1990); Li et al, Nature 353:815-821 (1991); Ge et al, 1. Biol. Chem. 266(27): 17954-17958 (1991); and Honee et al., Mol. Microbiol. 5(11): 2799-2806 (1991); each of which are incorporated herein by reference. Thus, it is now known that based on amino acid sequence homology, known Bt S-endotoxins have a similar three-dimensional structure comprising three domains.
      The toxin portions of Bt Cry proteins are also characterized by having five conserved blocks across their amino acid sequence numbered CB1 to CB5 from N-terminus to C-terminus, respectively (Hofte & Whiteley, supra). Conserved block 1 (CB1) comprises approximately 29 amino acids, conserved block 2 (CB2) comprises approximately 67 amino acids, conserved block 3 (CB3) comprises approximately 48 amino acids, conserved block 4 (CB4) comprises approximately 10 amino acids and conserved block 5 (CB5) comprises approximately 12 amino acids. The sequences before and after these five conserved blocks are highly variable and thus are designated the “variable regions,” V1-V6. Domain 1 of a Bt δ-endotoxin typically comprises variable region 1, conserved block 1, variable region 2, and the N-terminal 52 amino acids of conserved block 2. Domain II typically comprises approximately the C-terminal 15 amino acids of conserved block 2, variable region 3, and approximately the N-terminal 10 amino acids of conserved block 3, Domain III typically comprises approximately the C-terminal 38 amino acids of conserved block 3, variable region 4, conserved block 4, variable region 5, and conserved block 5. The Cry1 lepidopteran active toxins, among other delta-endotoxins, have a variable region 6 with approximately 1-3 amino acids lying within domain III.
      Many Bt strains and δ-endotoxins are active against different insect species and nematodes. However, relatively few of these strains and toxins have activity against coleopteran insects. Further, most of the now known native coleopteran-active δ-endotoxins, for example Cry3A, Cry3B, Cry3C, Cry7A, Cry8A, Cry8B, and Cry8C, have insufficient oral toxicity against corn rootworm to provide adequate field control if delivered, for example, through microbes or transgenic plants. Therefore, other approaches for producing novel toxins active against corn rootworm need to be explored.
      Lepidopteran-active δ-endotoxins have been engineered in attempts to improve specific activity or to broaden the spectrum of insecticidal activity. For example, the silk moth ( Bombyx mori) specificity domain from a Cry1Aa protein was moved to a Cry1Ac protein, thus imparting a new insecticidal activity to the resulting hybrid Bt protein (Ge et al. 1989, PNAS 86:4037-4041). Also, Bosch et al. 1998 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,131, incorporated herein by reference) describes Bacillus thuringiensis hybrid toxins comprising at their C-terminus domain III of a first Cry protein and at its N-terminus domains I and II of a second Cry protein. Such hybrid toxins were shown to have altered insecticidal specificity against lepidopteran insects. For example, the H04 hybrid toxin, which is also described in De Maagd et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62(5): 1537-1543 (1996), comprises at its N-terminus domains I and II of a Cry1Ab and at its C-erminus domain III of a Cry1C. H04 is reportedly highly toxic to the lepidopteran insect Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm) compared with the parental Cry1Ab toxin and significantly more toxic than the Cry1C parental toxin, it has also been shown that substitution of domain III of toxins, which are not active against the beet armyworm such as Cry1E and Cry1Ab, by domain III of Cry1C, which is active against beet armyworm, can produce hybrid toxins that are active against this insect. Ail of the hybrids disclosed in Bosch et al, use domains from lepidopteran active Cry proteins to make new toxins with lepidopteran activity. The results do suggest that domain III of Cry1C is an important determinant of specificity for beet armyworm. See also, Bosch et al., FEMS Microbiology Letters 118:129-134 (1994); Bosch et al., Bio/Technology 12:915-918 (1994); De Maagd et al, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62(8): 2753-2757 (1996); and De Maagd et al., Mol. Microbiol. 31(2); 463-471 (1999); each of which is incorporated herein by reference.
      Several attempts at engineering the coleopteran-active δ-endotoxins have been reported. Chen and Stacy (U.S. Pat. No. 7,030,295, herein incorporated by reference) successfully created a corn rootworm active toxin by inserting a non-naturally occurring protease recognition site in domain I, domain III, or both domains II and of a Cry3A protein. One of the resulting modified Cry3A proteins, designated Cry3A055, having a protease recognition site inserted in domain I, was active against several species of Diabrotica Van Rie et al, 1997, (U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,123) engineered Cry3A by randomly replacing amino acids, thought to be important in solvent accessibility, in domain II with the amino acid alanine. Several of these random replacements confined to domain II were reportedly involved in increased western corn rootworm toxicity. However, others have shown that some alanine replacements in domain II of Cry3A result in disruption of receptor binding or structural instability (Wo and Dean, 1996, J. Mol. Biol. 255; 628-640). English et al., 1999, (Intl. Pat. Appl. Publ. No. WO99/31248) reported amino acid substitutions in Cry3Bb that caused increases in toxicity to southern and western corn rootworm. However, of the 35 reported Cry3Bb mutants, only three, with mutations primarily in domain II and the domain I-domain II interface, were active against western corn rootworm. Further, the variation in toxicity of wild-type Cry3Bb against western corn rootworm in the same assays appear to be greater than any of the differences between the mutated Cry3Bb toxins and the wild-type Cry3Bb. Shadenkov et al. (1993, Mol. Biol. 27:586-591), made a hybrid protein by fusing amino acids 48-565 of a Cry3A protein to amino acids 526-725 of a Cry1Aa protein. Therefore, the cross-over between Cry3A and Cry1Aa sequence was in conserved block 4 located in domain III. Cry3A is very active against the Colorado potato beetle ( Leptinotarsa decemlineata). However, the hybrid protein disclosed by Shadenkov et al. was not active against Colorado potato beetle even though more than 75% of the hybrid protein was made up of Cry3A sequence. Thus, the addition of only 25% of Cry1Aa sequence destroyed activity against a coleopteran insect that the parent Cry3A was active against. This suggests that hybrid proteins made by fusing portions of a coleopteran-active Cry protein, e.g. Cry3A, and a lepidopteran-active Cry protein, e.g. Cry1A, would not have activity against coleopteran insects, particularly a coleopteran insect that is not naturally susceptible to Cry3A like corn rootworm.
      In view of the above discussion, there remains a need to design new and effective pest control agents that provide an economic benefit to farmers and that are environmentally acceptable. Particularly needed are proteins that are toxic to Diabrotica species, a major pest of corn, that have a different mode of action than existing insect control products as a way to mitigate the development of resistance. Furthermore, delivery of control agents through products that minimize the burden on the environment, as through transgenic plants, are desirable.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      In view of these needs, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel engineered hybrid insecticidal proteins (eHIPs). Such novel eHIPs are made by fusing unique combinations of variable regions and conserved blocks of at least two different Cry proteins and optionally including a protoxin tail region from a Bt Cry protein at the C-terminus or an N-terminal peptidyl fragment or both. For example, without limitation, by combining complete or partial variable regions and conserved blocks from a first Cry protein that has coleopteran activity with complete or partial variable regions and conserved blocks from a second Cry protein that has lepidopteran activity, and is different from tire first Cry protein, and optionally including a protoxin tail region from a lepidopteran active Bt Cry protein, or an N-terminal peptidyl fragment or both, new engineered hybrid insecticidal proteins are created that have activity against a spectrum of insects different from the first or second parent Cry proteins or both. Such novel eHIPs may comprise complete or partial variable regions, conserved blocks or domains from a modified Cry3A protein and a Cry protein different from the modified Cry3A protein. The peptidyl fragment may confer insecticidal activity upon the eHIP, or may increase the insecticidal activity of the eHIP over an eHIP without the peptidyl fragment, or make the eHIP more stable than an eHIP without the peptidyl fragment. The eHIPs of the invention have surprising and unexpected toxicity to corn rootworm ( Diabrotica sp.). The invention is further drawn to nucleic acids that encode the eHIPs or which is complementary to one which hybridizes under stringent conditions with the recombinant hybrid nucleic acids according to the invention.
      Also included in the invention are vectors containing such recombinant (or complementary thereto) nucleic acids; a plant or micro-organism which includes, and enables expression of such nucleic acids; plants transformed with such nucleic acids, for example transgenic corn plants; the progeny of such plants which contain, the nucleic acids stably incorporated and heritable in a Mendelian manner, and/or the seeds of such plants and such progeny.
      The invention also includes compositions and formulations containing the eHIPs, which are capable of inhibiting the ability of insect pests to survive, grow and reproduce, or of limiting insect-related damage or loss to crop plants, for example applying the eHIPs or compositions or formulations to insect-infested areas, or to prophylactically treat insect-susceptible areas or plants to confer protection against the insect pests.
      The invention is further drawn to a method of making the eHIPs and to methods of using the nucleic acids, for example in microorganisms to control insects or in transgenic plants to confer protection from insect damage.
      The novel eHIPs described herein are highly active against insects. For example, the eHIPs of the present invention can be used to control economically important insect pests such as western corn rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) northern corn rootworm ( D. longicornis barberi) and Mexican corn rootworm ( D. virgifera zeae). Certain eHIPs may also be used to control European corn borer ( Ostrinia nublalis) and other lepidopteran insects. The eHIPs can be used singly or in combination with other insect control strategies to confer maximal pest control efficiency with minimal environmental impact.
      Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a study of the following description of the invention and non-limiting examples.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2493163,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Human Factor VIII, also known as antihaemophilia factor or FVIII:C is a human plasma protein consisting of two polypeptides with light chain molecular weight of 80,000 daltons and a heavy chain molecular weight variable from 90,000 to 220,000. It is considered as one of the key cofactors in the coagulation pathway necessary for the conversion of Factor X into its active form Factor Xa. Factor VIII circulates in plasma as a non-covalent complex with von Willebrand Factor (also known as FVIII:RP). Hemophilia, a bleeding disorder is caused due to abnormal levels of Factor VIII. Factor VIII levels below 20% normal may result in hemophilic condition in humans. A drop in the levels of less than 1% of Factor VIII leads to severe bleeding disorder, with spontaneous joint bleeding being the most common symptom.
      The structure and biochemistry of recombinant factor VIII have been described previously.
      Traditionally, isolation and purification of Factor VIII has been from a plasma derived source (cryoprecipitate). Purification procedures from plasma-derived sources include those exploring the use of immunoaffinity purification using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for the purification of FVIII. However, there may be instances where the Factor VIII effluent contains some residual antibody due to leaching from the support matrix, which may result in antigenicity during ultimate use, i.e when introduced into human or animal system. Purification procedures exploring the use of ion exchange chromatography on e.g. agarose beads have also been used for purification of factor VIII from plasma. These methods, however, often suffer from certain levels of contamination of the resulting FVIII:C.
      However, purification of Factor VIII from genetically engineered recombinant source has gained importance in the past decade. Protein recovery and concentration of the final product is of utmost importance in the separation of recombinant proteins. The contaminants in recombinantly produced protein may include secreted proteins in the culture medium, media components, cell lysates, unwanted proteins produced by the cells and the nucleic acids.
      When purifying a recombinant protein, the aqueous source materials in which the polypeptides of interest are found are furthermore often seen to be contaminated with one or more viruses. Techniques for inactivating viruses in polypeptide mixtures are known in the art, such as e.g. chemical methods, using solvent/detergent solutions, irradiation methods, or thermal methods, but attempts to combine such techniques with known polypeptide purification processes have produced methods with a multiplicity of steps unsuitable for large-volume production. It is also important to exert caution in that the used viral-inactivating agents do not denature the protein or are difficult to separate from the protein of interest. These agents have, however, been either denaturing or difficult to separate from the polypeptide of interest, and have required a special treatment or separation step. Other conventional methods for treating polypeptide-containing preparations for potential viral contamination, such as heat or irradiation, have resulted in either significant denaturation of the polypeptide of interest and/or insufficient inactivation of viruses. Many of the commercially available recombinant Factor VIII products (Advate®, Helixate®, Kogenate FS®, ReFacto®) are made using immunoaffinity chromatography including a detergent for purification and viral inactivation.
      In the purification of therapeutic proteins produced by a recombinant DNA technique, it is well known that considerable problems are encountered when trying to reduce the content of DNA and Host Cell Protein (HCP) to the desired very low level.
      Nordfang et al. (Thrombosis and Haemostasis 58(4), 1043-1048 (1987) describes a separation using an antibody resin and a buffer containing 50% ethylene glycol and high salt.
      The purification of a recombinant protein expressed in mammalian cell system is typically performed in several steps. The different steps are usually separated into capture, intermediate and polishing. The objective of the capture step is two-fold; a) to obtain the target protein in a stable solution form and b) to reduce the volume (i.e. obtaining a solution concentrated with respect to protein content compared to the solution loaded onto the column (“the loading”).
      The latter step (reduction of volume) is critical to facilitate the subsequent steps of purification. The capture step is commonly achieved by using chromatography with an ion-exchange resin. The drawback of using an ion-exchange resin is that the conductivity and/or pH of the loading has to be adjusted. When the conductivity is adjusted, in most instances reduced, it is performed by addition of water which increases the volume of the starting material, making it impractical for subsequent steps and overall cumbersome for production purposes. Furthermore, adjustment of pH often results in the formation of aggregates which could interfere with the performance of the purification steps.
      After the capture step, an intermediate purification may follow, which removes most of the significant impurities including DNA, viruses and endotoxins. These impurities can also be remove/reduced in capture. The polishing step refers to a final purification step, wherein trace contaminants and impurities are removed and the yield is an active biological product. Contaminants removed during the polishing step are often conformers of the target molecule or suspected leakage products.
      There is still a need in the art for improved purification methods which are fast and efficient and wherein Factor VIII activity is essentially retained.
      The method of the present invention is advantageous in that it, in a single step, provides a volume reduction and a considerable increase in specific activity. Thus, the method, in a single step, combines a capture and a purification step.
      The present invention also provides an efficient process for producing a highly concentrated and very pure solution of recombinant Factor VIII wherein the Factor VIII protein is stabilized against degradation. With the present invention, it is possible to combine a capture and purification step without risking severe destabilization of the FVIII molecules and, in a single step, obtain an initial purification of the crude sample, obtain a substantial volume reduction (thereby facilitating further purification steps) as well as obtain a substantial purification factor (increase in FVIII specific activity) and a resulting solution (“capture pool”) wherein the protein is stabilized against degradation.

2684211,"BACKGROUND
      Oncolytic viruses (OVs) specifically infect, replicate in and kill malignant cells, leaving normal tissues unaffected. Several OVs have reached advanced stages of clinical evaluation for the treatment of various neoplasms (Russell S J. et al., (2012) Nat Biotechnol 30:658-670). Once approved, such viral agents could substitute or combine with standard cancer therapies and allow for reduced toxicity and improved therapeutic efficacy.
      In addition to the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Stojdl D F. et al., (2000) Nat Med 6:821-825; Stojdl D F. et al., (2003) Cancer Cell 4:263-275), other rhabdoviruses displaying oncolytic activity have been described recently (Brun J. et al., (2010) Mol Ther 18:1440-1449; Mahoney D J. et al., (2011) Cancer Cell 20:443-456). Among them, the non-VSV Maraba virus showed the broadest oncotropism in vitro (WO 2009/016433). A mutant Maraba virus with improved tumor selectivity and reduced virulence in normal cells was engineered. The attenuated strain is a double mutant strain containing both G protein (Q242R) and M protein (L123W) mutations. In vivo, this attenuated strain, called MG1 or Maraba MG1, demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in xenograft and syngeneic tumor models in mice, with superior therapeutic efficacy than the attenuated VSV, VSVΔM51 (WO 2011/070440).
      Data accumulated over the past several years has revealed that anti-tumor efficacy of oncolytic viruses not only depends on their direct oncolysis but may also depend on their ability to stimulate anti-tumor immunity (Bridle B W. et al., (2010) Mol Ther 184:4269-4275). This immune-mediated tumor control seems to play a critical role in the overall efficacy of OV therapy. Indeed, tumor-specific adaptive immune cells can patrol the tissues and destroy tumor cells that have been missed by the OV. Moreover, their memory compartment can prevent tumor recurrence.
      Various strategies have been developed to improve OV-induced anti-tumor immunity (Pol J. et al., (2012) Virus Adaptation and Treatment 4:1-21). Some groups have genetically engineered OV expressing immunomostimulatory cytokines. A herpes simplex and a vaccinia virus expressing Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) have respectively reached phase III and IIB of the clinical evaluation for cancer therapy while a VSV expressing IFN-β has just entered phase I.
      Another strategy, defined as an oncolytic vaccine, consists of expressing a tumor antigen from the OV (Russell S J. et al., (2012) Nat Biotechnol 30:658-670). Previously, it has been demonstrated that VSV could also be used as a cancer vaccine vector (Bridle B W. et al., (2010) Mol Ther 184:4269-4275). When applied in a heterologous prime-boost setting to treat a murine melanoma model, a VSV-human dopachrome tautomerase (hDCT) oncolytic vaccine not only induced an increased tumor-specific immunity to DCT but also a concomitant reduction in antiviral adaptive immunity. As a result, the therapeutic efficacy was dramatically improved with an increase of both median and long term survivals (WO 2010/105347). Although VSV was shown to be effective using hDCT as a tumor associated antigen, there is no way to predict what tumor associated antigens will be effective in a heterologous prime-boost setting.
      It is desirable to provide a vaccine vector that can be used to activate the patient's immune system to kill tumour cells with reduced toxicity to normal tissues, for example by activating antibodies and/or lymphocytes against a tumor associated antigen on the tumour. It is desirable if such a vaccine vector displays both oncolytic activity and an ability to boost adaptive cell immunity.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2631790,"BACKGROUND
      The most important trait as a target for crop improvement is yield. Efforts to improve crop yields by developing new plant varieties can be divided into two approaches. One is to reduce crop yield losses by breeding or engineering crop varieties with increased resistance to abiotic stress conditions such as drought, cold, or salt or to biotic stress conditions resulting from pests or disease-causing pathogens. While this approach has value, it does not provide fundamentally improved crop yield in the absence of stress conditions and in fact, such resistance may direct plant resources that otherwise would be available for increased yield in the plant. The second approach is to breed or engineer new crop varieties in which the basic yield capacity is increased.
      Classical breeding programs have initially produced substantial gains in improved yield in a variety of crops. A commonly experienced pattern though has been substantial gains in yield initially followed by incremental further improvements that become smaller and more difficult to obtain. More recently developed approaches based on molecular biology technologies have in principle offered the potential to achieve substantial improvement in crop yield by altering the timing, location, or level of expression of plant genes or heterologous genes that play a role in plant growth and/or development. Substantial progress has been made over the past twenty years in identifying plant genes and or heterologous genes that have a role in plant growth and/or development. Despite these gains in using molecular approaches, there continues to be a large unmet need for improved agronomic and horticultural plants produced through more conventional plant breeding. Because of the complexity of plant growth regulation and how it relates in the end to yield traits, it is still not obvious which, if any, of particular genes would be clear candidates to improve crop yield through either plant breeding and/or molecular techniques.
      KRP proteins belong to a class of cell cycle inhibitors that bind to and inhibit cyclin/CDK kinase complexes. Mutation of conserved residues within KRP family members are expected to modify KRP's ability to function as an inhibitor of cyclin-CDK kinase complexes. Specifically, some mutations in KRP genes would lead to expression of a non-functional KRP cell cycle inhibitor or a cell cycle inhibitor with reduced activity. This loss of or reduced cyclin/CDK kinase inhibitory activity would lead to increased cyclin-CDK kinase activity in cells when normally these cells would have reduced cyclin-CDK activity. This loss of or reduced cyclin/CDK kinase inhibitory activity would lead to increased cell divisions in tissue where the normal wild-type KRP version is expressed. This increased cell division would result in positive agronomic traits such as increased yield, increased weight, size, and/or number of one or more organs, for example, increased seed size, larger plants, larger leaves, larger roots etc. For background on KRP-related technologies, see, for example, WO/2007/016319 and US20070056058, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. The present invention identifies new KRP genes and proteins and provides methods for their use in producing improved agronomic and horticultural plants through conventional plant breeding and/or molecular methodologies.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The inventors of the present invention have used Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING®) methods in plants to identify KRP mutants, for example, in monocot plants, such as plants in the Triticeae tribe (e.g., plants in the Triticum genus), and plants in the tribe of Oryzeae (e.g., plants in Oryza genus), or in dicot plants, for example, in Glycine spp. The identified KRP mutants can be used for increasing weight, size, and/or number of one or more organs in a plant. The organ can be any part of a plant, for example, organs that contribute to yield in a plant. In some embodiments, the organ is seed, leaf, branch, root, shoot, stigma, ovule, pollen, seed pods, seed heads, or tiller. For example, in some embodiments, the present invention provides methods for increasing plant seed weight, seed size, seed number and/or yield.
      This invention describes the search for mutations in plant KRPs that are expressed in cells within the developing seed. The strategy was to identify KRP family member(s) with seed expression and TILL® for mutants in these KRPs. Certain mutants that affect KRP function can then be characterized for positive agronomical and horticultural traits such as increased yields, early emergence, accelerated growth etc. In addition, this same methodology can be used for KRPs expressed in other tissues such as leaves or stalks since increased cell divisions in these other tissues specific to the particular KRP expression pattern could also lead to positive agronomic traits.
      To date, KRP family members in agriculturally, horticulturally and/or industrially important plant species and their expression patterns in developing seed have yet to be studied. The inventors' strategy was to identify KRPs that are expressed in the developing seed. KRPs with expression pattern during development in a tissue specific manner are identified. For example, the rice KRP4 gene (OsKRP4) showed almost exclusive expression in the developing seed. Equivalents to this sequence in rice and other plant species are also identified.
      The present invention provides mutated KRP genes compared to a wild type KRP having nucleic acid sequence comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 60-86, 100-107, 111-128, fragments and variations derived from thereof, which encode a KRP gene. In some embodiments, the KRP has an expression pattern in a tissue specific manner during development. In some embodiments, the expression is embryonic specific, pollen specific, or seed specific.
      In some embodiments, the present invention provides mutated KRP genes compared to a wild type KRP comprising a sequence comprising a nucleic acid sequence that shares at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, at least 99.1%, at least 99.2%, at least 99.3%, at least 99.4%, at least 99.5%, at least 99.6%, at least 99.7%, at least 99.8%, or at least 99.9% identity to SEQ ID NOs: 60-86, 100-107, 111-128, 138-139, 141-142, and 144-145.
      In some embodiments, the present invention provides mutated KRP genes compared to a wild type KRP encoding an amino acid sequence having at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, at least 99.1%, at least 99.2%, at least 99.3%, at least 99.4%, at least 99.5%, at least 99.6%, at least 99.7%, at least 99.8%, or at least 99.9% identity to SEQ ID NO: 87-99, 108-110, 129-137, 140, 143, and 146.
      For example, the present invention provides mutants in wheat (Ta) KRP1A, KRP1B, KRP1D, KRP2A, KRP2B, KRP2D, KRP4B, KRP4D, KRP5A, KRP5D, KRP6A, KRP6B, KRP6D. It appears that hexaploid wheat has been naturally selected to have what appear to be knock-out mutations in KRP4A and KRP5B. This was discovered during the course of TILLING®. For KRP4A, the gene appears to be completely missing from the hexaploid wheat genome, although it is still present in the tetraploid genome. For KRP5B, there appears to be one missing nucleotide in the gene, which would shift the translational frame and produce a predicted truncation a few amino acids further on.
      The present invention in another aspect provides plant cells, plant parts, tissue culture, or whole plants comprising one or more disrupted KRP genes as described herein. In some embodiments, the present invention provides plant cells, plant parts, tissue culture or whole plants comprising at least one KRP gene, wherein the genome of the plant has one or more copies of the gene, and wherein the function of one or more copies of the KRP gene is disrupted.
      In some embodiments, the plant is a monocot. In some embodiments, the monocot is a species in the Triticeae tribe or the Oryzeae tribe. In some embodiments, the plant in the Triticeae tribe is a plant in the Triticum genus, and wherein the plant in the Oryzeae tribe is a plant in the Oryza genus.
      In some further embodiments, the plant in the Triticum genus is wheat, and wherein the plant in the Oryza genus is rice.
      In some further embodiments, the wheat plant is tetraploid or hexaploid.
      In some embodiments, the plant is a dicot. In some embodiments, the plant is a species in the Fabaceae family, for example, Glycine spp., such as soybean.
      In some embodiments, the KRP in the wheat is TaKRP1, TaKRP2, TaKRP4, TaKRP5, TaKRP6, for example, SEQ ID NOs. 60-86, 138-139, 141-142, 144-145 or functional variants thereof, and the KRP in the rice is OsKRP1, OsKRP2, OsKRP4, or OsKRP5, for example, SEQ ID NOs. 100-107, or functional variants thereof; and the KRP in the Glycine spp. is Gm0003×00821, Gm0013×00399, Gm0043, Gm0053×00526, Gm0087×00306, Gm0102×00087, Gm0119×00131, Gm0151×00019, Gm0067×00001, for example, SEQ ID NOs. 111-128, or functional variants thereof. For example, in a tetraploid wheat plant, the KRP is TaKRP1A, TaKRP1B, TaKRP2A, TaKRP2B, TaKRP4A, TaKRP4B, TaKRP5A, TaKRP5B, TaKRP6A or TaKRP6B. In a hexaploid wheat, the KRP is TaKRP1A, TaKRP1B, TaKRP1D, TaKRP2A, TaKRP2B, TaKRP2D, TaKRP4A, TaKRP4B, TaKRP4D, TaKRP5A, TaKRP5B, TaKRP5D, TaKRP6A, TaKRP6B, or TaKRP6D.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2722560,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
      The present disclosure provides Bcl-2 protein inhibitors and therapeutic methods of treating diseases, disorders, or conditions wherein inhibition of Bcl-2 proteins provides a benefit.
Background
      Apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, is an essential biological process for tissue homeostasis. In mammals, it has been shown to regulate early embryonic development. Later in life, cell death is a default mechanism by which potentially dangerous cells, e.g., cells carrying cancerous defects, are removed. Several apoptotic pathways are known. One of the most important apoptotic pathways involves the Bcl-2 family of proteins which are key regulators of the mitochondrial (also called “intrinsic”) pathway of apoptosis. See Danial and Korsmeyer, Cell 116:205-219 (2004). The structural homology domains BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4 are characteristic of Bcl-2 family proteins. The Bcl-2 family of proteins can be further classified into three subfamilies depending on how many of the homology domains each protein contains and on its biological activity, i.e., whether it has pro- or anti-apoptotic function.
      The first subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins contains proteins having all four homology domains, i.e., BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4. Their general effect is anti-apoptotic, that is to preserve a cell from starting a cell death process. Proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Bcl-xL, Md-1, and Bfl-1/A1 are members of this first subgroup. Proteins belonging to the second subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins contain the three homology domains BH1, BH2, and BH3, and have a pro-apoptotic effect. The two main representative proteins of this second subgroup are Bax and Bak. The third subgroup of Bcl-2 proteins is composed of proteins containing only the BH3 domain and members of this subgroup are usually referred to as “BH3-only proteins.” Their biological effect on the cell is pro-apoptotic. Bim, Bid, Bad, Bik, Noxa, Hrk, Bmf, and Puma are examples of this third subfamily of proteins. The exact mechanism by which the Bcl-2 family proteins regulate cell death is not entirely known. In one hypothesis of regulation of cell death by Bcl-2 family proteins, the BH3-only proteins are further categorized as either “activator,” e.g., Bim and Bid, or “sensitizer,” e.g., Bad, Bik, Noxa, Hrk, Bmf, and Puma, proteins depending on their regulatory function.
      One of the keys to tissue homeostasis is achieving a balance in the interactions among the three subgroups of Bcl-2 proteins in cells. Studies have elucidated the mechanisms by which pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic subgroups of Bcl-2 family proteins interact to allow a cell to undergo programmed cell death. After receiving intra- or extra-cellular signals in cells, post-translational or transcriptional activation of BH3-only proteins occurs. The BH3-only proteins are the primary inducers of an apoptotic cascade that includes, as one step, the activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak on the mitochondrial membrane in cells. Upon activation of Bax and/or Bak that are either already anchored to the mitochondrial membrane or migrate to this membrane, Bax and/or Bak oligomerize to result in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), the release of cytochrome C, and downstream activation of effector caspases, to ultimately result in cell apoptosis. Some researchers hypothesize that certain BH3-only proteins, e.g., Puma, Bim, Bid, are “activators” in that these proteins directly engage pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak to initiate MOMP, while other BH3-only proteins, e.g., Bad, Bik and Noxa, are “sensitizers” and induce Bax and Bak oligomerization indirectly by binding anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Md-1, and displacing and “freeing-up” the “activator” BH3-only proteins, which subsequently bind to and activate pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g., Bax, Bak, to induce cell death. Other research suggests that anti-apoptotic proteins engage and seqeuester Bax and Bak directly and all BH3-only proteins regulates this interaction by binding to anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Md-1, which results in the release Bax and Bak. See Adams and Cory, Oncogene 26:1324-1337 (2007) and Willis et al., Science 315:856-859 (2007). Although the exact interactions through which the anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis remain under investigation, there is a large body of scientific evidence to show that compounds which inhibit the binding of BH3-only proteins to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins promote apoptosis in cells.
      Dysregulated apoptotic pathways have been implicated in the pathology of many significant diseases such as neurodegenerative conditions (up-regulated apoptosis), such as for example, Alzheimer's disease; and proliferative diseases (down-regulated apoptosis) such as for example, cancer, autoimmune diseases and pro-thrombotic conditions.
      Down-regulated apoptosis (and more particularly the Bcl-2 family of proteins) may be involved in the onset of cancerous malignancy. Research has shown, for example, the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are over-expressed in many cancer cell types. See Zhang, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 1:101 (2002); Kirkin et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1644:229-249 (2004); and Amundson et al., Cancer Research 60:6101-6110 (2000). The effect of this deregulation is the survival of altered cells which would otherwise have undergone apoptosis in normal conditions. The repetition of these defects associated with unregulated proliferation is thought to be the starting point of cancerous evolution. Additionally, research has shown that BH3-only proteins can act as tumor suppressors when expressed in diseased animals.
      These findings have made possible new strategies in drug discovery for targeting cancer. If a small molecule that could mimic the effect of BH3-only proteins were able to enter the cell and overcome the anti-apoptotic protein over-expression, then it could be possible to reset the apoptotic process. This strategy can have the advantage that it can alleviate the problem of drug resistance which is usually a consequence of apoptotic deregulation (abnormal survival). Therapeutic strategies for targeting Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L in cancer to restore cancer cell sensitivity and overcome resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis have been reviewed. See Adams et al., Science 281:1322 (1998) and Reed, Adv. Pharmacol. 41:501 (1997); Reed et al., J. Cell. Biochem. 60:23 (1996).
      Platelets also contain the necessary apoptotic machinery, e.g., Bax, Bak, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, caspase-9, caspase-3 and APAF-1, to execute programmed cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Although circulating platelet production is a normal physiological process, a number of diseases are caused or exacerbated by excess of, or undesired activation of, platelets. This suggests that therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting anti-apoptotic proteins in platelets and reducing the number of platelets in mammals may be useful in treating pro-thrombotic conditions and diseases that are characterized by an excess of, or undesired activation of, platelets.
      Small molecule BH3-only protein mimetics such as ABT-737 and ABT-263 bind strongly to a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-w and Bcl-xL, and weakly to Mcl-1 and A1. These small molecules were tested in animal studies and demonstrated cytotoxic activity in certain xenograft models as single agents, as well as enhanced the effects of a number of chemotherapeutic agents on other xenograft models when used in combination. See Tse, C. et al., Cancer Res 68: 3421-3428 (2008) and van Delft, M. F. et al., Cancer Cell 10:389-399 (2006). These in vivo studies suggest the potential utility of inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins for the treatment of diseases that involve a dysregulated apoptotic pathway. ABT-199 (Venetoclax) is a potent Bcl-2 inhibitor that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. See Cang et al., Journal of Hematology & Oncology 8:129 (2015) and Souers et al., Nature Medicine 19:202-208 (2013).
      The natural expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins members vary in different cell types. For example, in young platelets, Bcl-xL protein is highly expressed and plays an important role in regulating cell death (life span) of platelets. Also, in certain cancer cell types, the cancer cell's survival is attributed to the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway caused by the over-expression of one or more anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members. In view of the important role for Bcl-2 family of proteins in regulating apoptosis in both cancerous and normal, i.e., non-cancerous, cells, and the recognized inter-cell type variability of Bcl-2 family protein expression, it is advantageous to have a small molecule inhibitor that selectively targets and preferably binds to one type or a subset of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein(s), for example, to an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that overexpressed in a certain cancer type. Such a selective compound also may confer certain advantages in the clinical setting, by providing, for example, the flexibility to select a dosing regimen, a reduced on-target toxic effect in normal cells, among others, e.g., lymphopenia has been observed in Bcl-2 deficient mice. See Nakayama, K. et al. PNAS 91:3700-3704 (1994).
      There is an ongoing need for small molecules that selectively inhibit the activity of one type or a subset of Bcl-2 proteins for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2740438,"BACKGROUND
      A natural killer (NK) cell is an effector cell working in a first line of a defense mechanism of an immune system in vivo, such as performing a function of removing tumor cells and host cells infected with bacteria, intracellular parasites or viruses without prior sensitization with antigens; rejecting an inappropriate bone-marrow transplantation; regulating an immune response of T cells; and the like.
      An immunological function of the NK cell depends on a balance between a stimulatory signal for inducing a killing function thereof and an inhibitory signal for inhibiting the killing function. Particularly, the NK cell, which strongly receives the stimulatory signal, attacks and removes a target cell, and the NK cell, which strongly receives the inhibitory signal, leaves the target cell alive.
      As the killing function of the NK cell, there are antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and natural killing. The ADCC and the natural killing have it in common that both need an activation of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and are blocked by means of the inhibitory signal delivered by an inhibitory receptor of the NK cell. The killing function of the NK cell depends on the balance between the stimulatory signal and the inhibitory signal, and thus the NK cell may distinguish normal host cells from infected or cancerized cells to remove the latter.
      The NK cell may be classified according to an expression level of CD56, and at least 90% of CD56 dim NK cells are distributed in peripheral blood NK cells. It is known that the CD56 dim has higher cytotoxicity than other CD56-expressing NK cells and shows a high expression of killer Ig-like receptors (KIR) and perforin, which are activating receptors of the NK cell. It is also known that CD56 bright NK cells are smaller in number and have lower cytotoxic capacity than the CD56 dim NK cells. However, it is reported that the CD56 bright NK cells have not only a high immunoregulatory function (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, etc.), but also a high ADCC function ( The Journal of Immunology, 2011, 186:6753-6761). In particular, the CD56 bright NK cells are expected to have an improved effect in combination therapy on antibody and cancer.
      On the other hand, it is well known that a tumor may express a unique protein associated with a malignant phenotype thereof or may over-express a certain protein more in number than normal cells. The expression of the unique protein on a surface of a tumor cell makes it possible to probe the tumor for its phenotypic identity and biochemical composition and activity, thus providing an opportunity for diagnosing and characterizing a disease, or also possible to target a tumor-associated antigen, thus developing a novel therapeutic method for the tumor.
      It is known that an antibody showing an antigen-antibody reaction specific to the tumor-associated antigen attacks cancer cells and causes cell deaths by inducing various in vivo immune responses (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC) activity, etc.). Thus, the antibody useful in tumor treatment, etc. is being developed now, but little research and development has been done to enhance a therapeutic efficacy thereof.
      Against these backdrops, there is a need to perform research and development on a method for effectively treating cancer by using NK cells and cancer antigens, which are specifically expressed on the surface of cancer cells.

Technical Solution
      The present inventors have performed research and development on a method for effectively introducing a natural killer (NK) cell, an immunocyte therapeutic agent, into a cancer tissue. As a result, the present inventors have identified that, out of receptors of an activity-inducing substance expressed on a surface of the NK cell, CXCR3 and CXCR6 are over-expressed on the surface of the NK cell, then identified that, out of ligands thereof, CXCL16 is effective in a migration of the NK cell, and then identified that an induction of the NK cell into cancer is remarkably increased and thus has a remarkable effect on cancer treatment by preparing and administering a fusion protein specific to a tumor-associated antigen as well as CXCL16 having an NK cell-inducing property, thereby completing the present invention.
      As used herein, the term “tumor-associated antigen” means an antigen, which is not expressed on a normal cell or over-expressed only on a tumor cell contrary to the normal cell, preferably specifically expressed on a surface of the tumor cell, wherein such antigen refers to an antigenic substance produced from tumor cells.
      The tumor-associated antigen, which is specifically expressed on a tumor, may include, for example, 4-1BB (CD137), 5T4, AGS-5, AGS-16, Angiopoietin 2, CD19 (Cluster of Differentiation 19), B7.1 (CD80), B7.2 (CD86), B7DC, B7H1, B7H2, B7H3, BT-062, BTLA, CAIX, Carcinoembryonic antigen, CTLA4, Cripto, ED-B, ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, EGFL7, EpCAM, EphA2, EphA3, EphB2, FAP, fibronectin, folate receptor, Ganglioside GM3, GD2, glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), gplOO, gpA33, GPNMB, ICOS, IGFIR, integrin αυ, Integrin αυβ, KIR, LAG-3, Lewis Y, Mesothelin, c-MET, Her2 (human EGFR-related 2), MN carbonic anhydrase IX, MUC1, MUC16, Nectin-4, NKGD2, NOTCH, OX40, OX40L, PD-1, PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1), PSCA, PSMA, RANKL, ROR1, ROR2, SLC44A4, Syndecan-1, TACI, TAG-72, Tenascin, TIM3, TRAILR1, TRAILR2, EGFR, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 or the like, but not limited thereto.

      The “antibody or fragment thereof” may specifically or preferably bind to a tumor cell compared to a non-tumor cell or a normal cell, preferably a tumor-associated antigen specifically expressed in the tumor. Herein, “specifically bind” or “preferably bind” means that a binding between two binding partners (e.g., an antibody and a binding partner thereof, i.e., an antigen) is selective with regard to the two binding partners and may be distinguished from undesired or non-specific interactions.
      As used herein, the term “single-chain Fv” or “scFv (single-chain variable fragment)” refers to an antibody, in which heavy chain and light chain variable domains of a conventional two-chain antibody bind to each other to form one chain. Typically, a linker peptide is inserted between the two chains to allow an appropriate folding and a formation of an active binding site.

      As used herein, the term “expression vector” includes a nucleotide sequence coding a molecule of interest, which is agonistically bound to a promoter.
      As used herein, the terms “polypeptide,” “peptide” and “protein” are interchangeably used and include a reference to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms are applied not only to natural amino acid polymers, but also to artificial amino acid polymers, which are chemical analogues of natural amino acids, to which at least one amino acid residue corresponds. The terms are also applied to the polymers containing a conservative amino acid replacement such that protein may remain agonistic.
      As used herein, the term “host cell” means a cell capable of supporting a replication or expression of the expression vector. The host cell may be prokaryotic cells, for example, Escherichia coli, or eucaryotic cells, for example, yeast, insect, amphibian or mammalian cells.
      With regard to a growth or progression of tumor or cancer, the terms “inhibiting,” “reducing” and “decreasing” refer to inhibiting a growth, diffusion or metastasis of a patient's tumor or cancer by up to a measurable amount by using any method known in the art. The growth, progression or diffusion of the tumor or cancer is inhibited, reduced or decreased, if a size of the tumor is reduced by at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 80% or 100% compared to the tumor size measured, for example, before co-administering a fusion polypeptide of the present invention and NK cells, an immunocyte therapeutic agent, or before administering the fusion polypeptide.
      The present invention provides a fusion polypeptide comprising: an antibody or fragment thereof binding to a tumor-associated antigen; a linker; and a NK cell-inducing protein of CXCL16.
      The fusion polypeptide according to the present invention may specifically bind to a cell surface of a tumor by comprising an antibody or fragment thereof binding to a tumor-associated antigen, and may also induce the NK cell into a targeted tumor cell by means of CXCL16, i.e., a NK cell-inducing protein, which is cleaved and released after an antigen-antibody binding.
      The fusion polypeptide according to the present invention binds to a tumor-targeting surface antigen by comprising an antibody or fragment thereof specifically binding to a tumor-associated antigen.

V H and V L regions of the scFv antibody contain a single chain, which is folded to form an antigen-binding site similar to the one, which is found in a two-chain antibody. Once folded, the single-chain antibody is stabilized by means of a non-covalent interaction. In a more specific exemplary embodiment, the scFv is formed by means of recombination. A conservative variant of the antibody of the present invention may be conventionally prepared, and the conservative variant used in the scFv fragment will maintain an important amino acid residue, which is needed for a precise folding and stabilization between the V H and V L regions.
      According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, scFv is mesothelin scFv, which has an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, and particularly may be coded by means of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 2.
      According to other exemplary embodiment of the present invention, scFv is PD-L1 scFv, which may comprise a heavy chain (V H) of an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3, particularly coded by means of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 4; and a light chain (V L) of an amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 5, particularly coded by means of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 6, and the tumor-associated antigen, i.e. PD-L1 may be the one coded by means of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 7, but not limited thereto.

      The scFv antibody may be directly bound to a peptide linker through a light chain, and may be bound thereto through an Fc region, to which scFv is bound.
      According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, Fc (constant region) may have an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 13, and particularly may be coded by means of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 14, but not limited thereto.
      A linker according to the present invention will not have a certain biologic activity except binding the regions as a peptide linker or conserving some minimum distance or other spatial relationship between the regions, but constituent amino acids may be selected to have an influence on some properties of the molecules, for example, folding, net charge or hydrophobicity. Also, the linker may comprise a cleavage sequence such that CXCL16 may be isolated after an antibody binds to a tumor-associated antigen. An antibody or fragment thereof specifically binding to a tumor-associated antigen may be linked through a peptide linker having a length of at most 50 amino acids, generally at most 40 amino acids, preferably at most 30 amino acids, more preferably at most 20 amino acids, and much more preferably 1 to 10 amino acids.
      For example, the peptide linker may comprise a sequence, which is cleaved by any protease, and particularly may be the peptide linker comprising consecutive amino acid residues of RVKR, which is cleaved by furin, but not limited thereto.
      According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a fusion polypeptide according to the present invention comprises a furin cleavage site, which is cleaved by furin, that is, the furin cleavage site comprising consecutive amino acid residues, which may be cleaved by furin, such that an NK cell-inducing protein may be released from a cancer cell.
      The furin cleavage site may be any polypeptide site, which may be cleavable by means of furin. As reported by Duckert, etc. (Document [Duckert et al., Protein Engineering, Design & Selection 17(1):107-112 (2004)], which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), furin is an enzyme “based on an evolutionarily conserved dibasic- and monobasic-specific CA 2+-dependent serine protease, also called subtilisin/kexin-like proprotein convertases.”
      A sequence of the furin cleavage site, which is known in the document, etc., is incorporated herein, and particularly has an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 15 and may be coded by means of a base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 16, but not limited thereto.
      The antibody or fragment thereof binding to a tumor-associated antigen may be bound to the furin cleavage sequence through an amino terminus of the furin cleavage site, and may be directly bound to the light chain, heavy chain, Fc (constant region) or framework regions of the antibody.
      The fusion protein of the present invention comprises a NK cell-inducing protein of CXCL16, such that the inventive fusion protein may induce the NK cell into a tumor cell having the antibody bound to the tumor-associated antigen.
      The “NK cell-inducing protein” according to the present invention means a protein for inducing the NK cell into the tumor cell, that is, CXCL16, which is the protein capable of migrating the NK cell into the cancer cell by means of chemokine.
      Particularly, the CXCL16 may have an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 17. The CXCL16 may be coded by means of a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18.
      The NK cell-inducing protein may be linked to the antibody or fragment thereof through the peptide linker. The linker according to the present invention will not have a certain biologic activity except binding the regions as a peptide linker or conserving some minimum distance or other spatial relationship between the regions, but constituent amino acids may be selected to have an influence on some properties of the molecules, for example, folding, net charge or hydrophobicity. Also, the linker may comprise a cleavage sequence, e.g. the cleavage sequence by means of any protease such that CXCL16 may be isolated after an antibody binds to a tumor-associated antigen.
      According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the peptide linker comprises a furin cleavage site, which is cleaved by furin, that is, the furin cleavage site comprising consecutive amino acid residues, which may be cleaved by furin.
      The fusion polypeptide according to the present invention may be prepared by means of a non-recombination method or a recombination method known in the art, preferably by means of the recombination method.
      In other words, an expression vector may be prepared by inserting cDNA coding the antibody or fragment thereof binding to a tumor-associated antigen; a linker; and a NK cell-inducing protein of CXCL16 into the vector.
      According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the expression vector is prepared by inserting a base sequence comprising mesothelin scFv and Fc into a vector, particularly, a pcDNA3.1 vector, and by inserting a furin cleavage site and a base sequence coding the NK cell-inducing protein behind an immunoglobulin sequence. An example of the prepared expression vector is as described in a following FIG. 2.
      The prepared expression vector may be expressed in bacterial, plant, yeast, insect and mammalian cells. Those skilled in the art may prepare the fusion polypeptide by using a number of expression systems, which may be used in a protein expression, including Escherichia coli, other bacterial host, yeast and various higher eucaryotic cells, for example, COS, CHO, HeLa and myeloma cell lines.
      According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the fusion polypeptide may be prepared by transfecting a CHO cell, from which furin is removed, with the expression vector.
      The prepared fusion polypeptide may provide a targeted fusion polypeptide by being purified according to a standard process in the art including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity column, column chromatography, etc.
      The present invention provides a nucleic acid coding the fusion polypeptide.
      The present invention provides an expression vector comprising a nucleic acid sequence coding the fusion polypeptide. Particularly, the present vector may provide the expression vector having a structure as shown in FIG. 2, which may have a base sequence of SEQ ID NO: 19.
      The present invention provides a host cell comprising the expression vector. Particularly, such host cell may be one cell selected from COS, CHO, HeLa and myeloma cell lines, but not limited thereto.

The pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating cancer according to the present invention includes not only a direct therapeutic effect but also an action as an anti-cancer adjuvant.
      According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, it was identified that a distribution of cells is changed from CD56 dim into CD56 bright with regard to the NK cells by means of CXCL16 of the fusion polypeptide prepared according to the present invention, and also identified that the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is effective in preventing or treating cancer by means of a differentiation into CD56 bright having a higher ADCC effect compared to CD56 dim.
      The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating cancer, comprising a fusion polypeptide having: an antibody or fragment thereof binding to a tumor-associated antigen; a linker; and a NK cell-inducing protein of CXCL16, and the NK cells.
      According to the present invention, a co-administration of the fusion polypeptide along with the NK cells, an immunocyte therapeutic agent, greatly increases an influx of the NK cells into cancer, thereby having a remarkable effect on preventing or treating cancer.
      The pharmaceutical composition to be used in the present invention may be formulated into a dosage form by means of a standard technique, using at least one physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient. A suitable pharmaceutical carrier is disclosed in the present invention and the document (Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Lippencott Williams & Wilkins (2005)).
      Such pharmaceutical composition may be formulated into a dosage form such that the inventive fusion polypeptide and/or the NK cells may be administered via any suitable route, for example, an inhalation, local, nasal, oral, parenteral or intrarectal route. Thus, the administration of the pharmaceutical composition mentioned above may be performed by means of an intradermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, inhalational, intracerebral, endotracheal, intra-arterial, intraperitoneal, intravesical, intrapleural, intracoronary, subcutaneous or intratumoral injection, or by using a syringe or other devices. A percutaneous administration is also considered along with an inhalation or aerosol administration. A tablet and capsule may be administered orally, rectally or vaginally.
      The pharmaceutical composition will comprise the fusion polypeptide, or the fusion polypeptide and NK cells, which are conventionally dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier. The fusion polypeptide and NK cells may be provided together or separately. Various aqueous carriers, for example, buffered salt water, etc. may be used. Such solution has a bactericidal property and does not generally have an undesirable substance. Such composition may be sterilized by means of a conventional, widely known sterilization technique. The composition may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, as required to meet the physiological conditions, for example, a pH adjuster and buffer, toxicity adjusting agent, etc. for example, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium lactate, etc. A concentration of the fusion polypeptide in such dosage form may be extensively various, and may be selected mainly based on a fluid volume, viscosity, weight, etc. according to a selected certain administration mode and a patient's need.
      The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is suitable for a parenteral administration, including an intravenous or intracoelomic administration.
      The fusion polypeptide and/or NK cells of the present invention may be formulated into a dosage form for the parenteral administration via an injection, for example, a bolus or continuous injection. The dosage form for injection may be present along with an added preservative in a unit-dosage form container, for example, an ampule or a multi-dose container. An injectable composition is preferably an aqueous isotonic solution or suspension, and a suppository is preferably prepared from a lipid emulsion or suspension. The composition may be sterilized and/or contain an adjuvant, for example, a preservative, stabilizer, humectant or emulsifier, dissolution promoter, osmoregulatory salt and/or buffer. On the other hand, the active component may be present in a form of powder, which is made up before use by means of a suitable vehicle, for example, sterile pyrogen-free water. Also, the active component may contain other therapeutically valuable substances. The compositions are prepared according to a conventional mixing, granulation or coating method, respectively, and contain about 0.1 to 75%, preferably 1 to 50% of an active component.
      In case of an oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition or drug may take on a form of tablet or capsule, which is prepared, for example, by conventional means, along with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. It is preferable that such pharmaceutical composition or drug should be the tablet and gelatin capsule, containing the active component, that is, the composition of the present invention along with: (a) a diluent or filler, for example, lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose (for example, ethyl cellulose, and microcrystalline cellulose), glycine, pectin, polyacrylate and/or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and calcium sulphate; (b) a lubricant, for example, silica, talcum, stearic acid, magnesium or calcium salt thereof, metallic stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, hydrogenated vegetable oil, maize starch, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate and/or polyethylene glycol; also, in case of the tablet, (c) a binder, for example, magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and/or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose; in some cases, (d) a disintegrating agent, for example, starch (for example, potato starch or sodium starch), glycollate, agar, alginic acid or sodium salt thereof, or an effervescent blend; (e) a humectant, for example, sodium lauryl sulphate; and/or (f) an absorbent, coloring agent, flavoring agent and sweetening agent.
      The present invention administers the pharmaceutical composition into a patient in a therapeutically effective dose for preventing, treating or inhibiting a disease such as cancer, or a malignant condition thereof. The pharmaceutical composition is administered into the patient in a sufficient amount enough to draw an effective therapeutic or diagnostic response from the patient. The effective therapeutic or diagnostic response refers to the response, which at least partially inhibits or delays symptoms or complications of the disease or malignant condition. A suitable amount for performing such administration is defined as a “therapeutically effective amount.”
      A dosage of the fusion polypeptide and/or NK cells to be administered varies depending on a mammal's species, weight, age, individual condition, surface area of a region to be treated, and administration type. A size of the dose may be also determined according to a presence, property and degree of any side effect to a certain patient, which accompanies an administration of a certain compound.
      A unit dosage to be administered into a mammal of about 50 to 80 kg, preferably a human, may contain the fusion polypeptide in an amount of about 1 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg, and may contain the NK cells in an amount of about 1×10 5 cells/kg to 2×10 7 cells/kg.
      Typically, the dosage of the composition of the present invention is a sufficient dosage enough to achieve a targeted effect. An optimal administration schedule may be determined by measuring the fusion polypeptide and/or NK cells and calculating an accumulation thereof in the patient's body. Such composition may be provided at least once a day, week, month or year. Those skilled in the art may easily determine an optimal dosage, administration method and repetition rate. Those skilled in the art may determine an optimal administration for administering the fusion polypeptide and/or NK cells into humans according to an established protocol known in the art and disclosed in the present invention. However, it is to be understood that an actual dosage of an effective component should be determined considering various related factors such as a disease to be treated, a severity of the disease, an administration route, a patient's weight, age, gender and the like, and thus the dosage is not construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any aspect.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2632571,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      To achieve desired expression levels of heterologous proteins in transgenic plants it has been found beneficial to alter the native, sometimes referred to as wild-type or original, DNA coding sequence in various ways, e.g. so that codon usage more closely matches the codon usage of the host plant species, and/or so the G+C content of the coding sequence more closely matches the G+C level typically found in coding sequences of the host plant species, and/or so that certain sequences that destabilize mRNA are removed. Expression in plants of Bacillus thuringiensis (B.t.) crystal protein insect toxins, for example, has been improved using one or more of these approaches. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,380,301, 5,625,136, 6,218,188, 6,340,593, 6,673,990, 7,741,118. Codon degeneracy allows one to make synthetic DNA sequences that encode a protein of interest using codons that differ from those used in the original DNA coding sequence.
      In regard to removing sequences that may destabilize mRNA, U.S. Pat. No. 7,741,118 discloses a list of 16 polyadenylation signal sequences (column 15, Table II) and calls for reducing the number of such sequences in synthetic coding sequences that are intended for expression in plants. The polyadenylation signal sequences listed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,741,118, Table II are listed below in Table 1:

        U.S. Pat. No. 7,741,118 also calls for preferably removing the sequence ATTTA (known as the Shaw-Kamen sequence), because it has been identified as potentially destabilizing mRNA.
      Contrary to the teaching of U.S. Pat. No. 7,741,118, we have found that reduction in the number of the polyadenylation signal sequences identified in Table 1 above is neither necessary nor sufficient to enable enhanced expression of synthetic genes in plants.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2433181,"BACKGROUND
       Human erythropoietin (EPO), a member of the haematopoietic growth factor family, is synthesized mainly in the adult kidney and fetal liver in response to tissue hypoxia due to decreased blood oxygen availability [1]. The principal function of EPO is to act directly on certain red blood cell (RBC) progenitors and precursors in the bone marrow to stimulate the synthesis of hemoglobin and mature RBCs. It also controls the proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of RBCs. Recombinant EPO having the amino-acid sequence of naturally occurring EPO has been produced and approved to treat anemia associated with kidney functional failure, cancer and other pathological conditions [2]. In addition to its erythropoietic properties, recent research reports [3] indicate that EPO also acts on non-bone marrow cells such as neurons, suggesting other possible physiological/pathological functions of EPO in the central nervous system (CNS) and other organs/systems. Since EPO receptors have been found in many different organs, EPO may have multiple biological effects, such as acting as an anti-apoptotic agent.
       Human EPO is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 30.4 kilo-daltons. Carbohydrates account for approximately 39% of its total mass. The EPO gene is located on chromosome 7q 11-22 and spans a 5.4 kb region with five exons and four introns [4]. The precursor of EPO consists of 193 amino acids. Cleavage of the leader sequence and the last amino acid Arg by post-translational modification yields the mature EPO having 165 amino acids. Glycosylation, with three N-linked sites at Asn 24, Asn38, Asn83 and one O-linked site at Ser126, plays a crucial role in the biosynthesis, tertiary structure and the in vivo bioactivity of EPO [5]. EPO functions by binding to an erythropoietin receptor, a glycosylated and phosphorylated transmembrane polypeptide with the molecular weight of 72-78 kilodaltons. This binding triggers the homodimerization of the receptors that leads to the activation of several signal transduction pathways: JAK2/STAT5 system, G-protein, calcium channel, and kinases. Two molecules of EPO protein are needed to bind simultaneously to one receptor molecule to achieve optimal receptor activation [6].
       As the first hematopoietic growth factor approved for human therapy, recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) has been used for the treatment of anemia resulting from chronic renal failure, cancers (primarily chemotherapy-associated anemia), autoimmune diseases, AIDS, surgery, bone marrow transplantation and myelodysplastic syndromes, etc. Interestingly, recent studies have also observed that rHuEPO has non-blood system functions and shows the potential of being used as a neuroprotective drug for cerebral ischemia, brain trauma, inflammatory disease and neural degenerative disorders [7].
       Currently, three kinds of rHuEPO or rHuEPO analogs are commercially available, namely rHuEPO alpha, rHuEPO beta, and darbepoetin alfa [8]. These three recombinant proteins bind to the same erythropoietin receptor, but differ in structure, degree of glycosylation, receptor-binding affinity and in vivo metabolism. Since the initial introduction of rHuEPO-alpha in the 1980s, clinicians quickly recognized the frequent dose/injection requirement of the drug as a significant shortcoming. The mean in vivo half-lives of rHuEPO alpha and rHuEPO beta administered intravenously or subcutaneously are only 8.5 and 17 hours respectively [9, 10]. Patients therefore need an injection schedule of daily, twice weekly or three times per week which imposes a burden on both patients and health care providers. Thus, there has been a longstanding need to develop recombinant EPO analogs having a longer in vivo half-life and/or enhanced erythropoietic activity.
       Attempts have been made in the prior art to genetically change or chemically modify the structure of the native EPO protein to either slow down its in vivo metabolism or improve its therapeutic properties. For example, there appears to be a direct correlation between the amounts of sialic acid-containing carbohydrates on the EPO molecule and its in vivo metabolism and functional activity. Increasing the carbohydrate content of the EPO molecule thus results in a longer half-life and enhanced activities in vivo [11, 12]. Amgen has designed the rHuEPO analog darbepoetin alpha to include 5 N-linked carbohydrate chains, two more than rHuEPO. Darbepoetin alpha is also known as Novel Erythropoiesis Stimulating Protein (NESP) and is sold under the trademark Aranesp™. Darbepoetin alpha differs from native human EPO at five positions (Ala3OAsn, His32Thr, Pro87Val, Trp88Asn, Pro90Thr) which allows for the attachment of two additional N-linked oligosaccharides at asparagines residue positions 30 and 88. Darbepoetin alpha binds to the EPO receptor in an identical manner as native EPO to induce intracellular signaling involving tyrosine phosphorylation by JAK-2 kinase and the same intracellular molecules Ras/MAP-k, P13-k and STAT-5. Due to the increased carbohydrate content, the half-life of darbepoetin alpha in both animals and humans is almost three fold-longer than that of rHuEPO-alpha (25.3 hours vs 8.5 hours) [9]. Darbepoetin alpha (Aranesp™) also appears to exhibit enhanced bioactivity in comparison to naturally occurring or recombinant human EPO in vivo [13] and has been approved by FDA as a second generation rHuEPO drug; this drug only needs to be administrated once per week to achieve the identical therapeutic effects of 2-3 time injections per week of rHuEPO[10, 14, 15].
       Other attempts to extend the half-life of EPO have focused on increasing the molecular weight of the EPO protein through chemical conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) and the like. PEGylated-EPO has a much larger molecular weight and is protected from being cleared from circulation and therefore has a longer plasma half-life [16]. However, PEGylation may alter the protein structure resulting in unanticipated changes of function and specificity of the EPO moiety. There are also reports of increasing the molecular weight of EPO by other methods, such as to link the EPO molecule to a carrier protein (human albumin), or to form the homodimerization of two complete EPO molecules by using linking peptides (3- to 17-amino acids) or by chemical cross-linking reagents [17, 18, 19, 20]. While all these methods have achieved some success in extending the half-life and enhancing the activities of EPO, combining the EPO molecule with the Fc fragment of human immunoglobulin (IgG) in a fusion protein as described in the present application achieves unique advantages.
       Human immunoglobulin IgG is composed of four polypeptides linked covalently by disulfide bonds (two identical copies of light chain and heavy chain). The proteolysis of IgG molecule by papain generates two Fab fragments and one Fc fragment. The Fc fragment consists of two polypeptides linked together by disulfide bonds. Each polypeptide, from N- to C-terminal, is composed of a hinge region, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain. The Fc fragment structure is almost the same among all subtypes of human immunoglobulin. IgG is among one of the most abundant proteins in the human blood and makes up 70 to 75% of the total immunoglobulins in human serum. The half-life of IgG in circulation is the longest among all five types of immunoglobulin and may reach 21 days.
       Modern bio-engineering technology has been successfully applied to the creation of fusion proteins consisting of therapeutic protein fragments, such as cytokines and soluble receptors, and the Fc fragment of human IgG [21, 22, 23, 24]. These fusion proteins have a significantly longer in vivo half-life while retaining their biological and therapeutic properties. So far two fusion proteins comprising an Fc fragment have been successfully developed as biomedicines and approved by FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis [25, 26].
       It has been shown in the prior art that dimers of two EPO molecules linked either by chemical cross-linking or by a polypeptide exhibit enhanced in vivo activities and a prolonged half-life[17, 19]. The enhanced activity may due to the more efficient binding of the EPO dimer to one receptor, and the prolonged in vivo half-life due to the larger size of the dimer protein. However, the chemical cross-linking process is not efficient and is difficult to control. Moreover, the linkage peptide in the dimer of EPO may alter the three-dimensional structure of EPO molecule and the peptide itself may stimulate immunogenic responses in vivo. These shortcomings impair the therapeutic potential of EPO dimers, particularly since EPO replacement therapy in renal patients is life-long.
       The need has therefore arisen for EPO analogs that have a significantly longer half-life and enhanced erythropoietic activities in vivo but have no increased immunogenic properties.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       In accordance with the invention, a recombinant fusion protein comprising a human erythropoietin peptide portion linked to an immunoglobulin peptide portion is described. The fusion protein has a prolonged half-life in vivo in comparison to naturally occurring or recombinant native human erythropoietin. In one embodiment of the invention, the protein has a half-life in vivo at least three fold higher than native human erythropoietin. The fusion protein may also exhibit enhanced erythropoietic bioactivity in comparison to native human erythropoietin.
       In one embodiment of the invention the immunoglobulin peptide portion is an Fc fragment, such as an IgG1 fragment. The Fc fragment includes CH2 and CH3 domains and a hinge region. The EPO peptide portion may be directly linked to the hinge region. Preferably the hinge region is at least 9 amino acids in length. In one embodiment, the EPO peptide portion has a cysteine residue proximate the C terminal thereof and the hinge region includes a cysteine residue located nearest the EPO peptide portion. Preferably these two cysteine residues are spaced at least 12 amino acids apart. In one embodiment, the EPO peptide portion may comprise a complete EPO molecule directly linked to the immunoglobulin portion (i.e. no external peptide linkers are interposed between the EPO and immunoglobulin portions).
       The invention also relates to multimeric protein constructs comprising multiple units of the fusion protein of the invention. For example, two fusion proteins may be assembled as a dimer, wherein the hinge regions of the proteins are joined by disulphide bonds. The dimer has the general shape of a IgG molecule and is more stable than free EPO molecules.
       The invention also relates to nucleic acid and amino acid sequences encoding the fusion protein and transfected cell lines and methods for producing the fusion protein. The invention further includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising the fusion protein and methods of using the fusion protein and/or the pharmaceutical compositions, for example to stimulate erythropoiesis in subjects in need of therapy.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2238951,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      1.1. Technical Field
      The present invention relates to a chimeric protein containing an intramolecular chaperone (IMC) like sequence linked to a target protein. In particular, the invention relates to a chimeric protein containing an IMC like sequence linked to an insulin precursor. The present invention also relates to a process for obtaining a correctly folded insulin-precursor-containing chimeric protein, comprising, inter alia, contacting an incorrectly folded chimeric protein containing an IMC like sequence linked to an insulin precursor with at least one chaotropic auxiliary agent. The present invention further relates to an assay for screening an amino acid sequence for the ability to improve folding of an insulin precursor using a chimeric protein containing an IMC like sequence linked to an insulin precursor.
      1.2. Background Art
1.2.1. Intramolecular Chaperones and Protein Folding
      Molecular chaperones are defined as a class of proteins that assist correct folding of other polypeptides but are not components of the functional assembled structure (Shinde and Inouye, TIBS, 1993, 18:442-446). Intramolecular chaperones (IMCs) are part of the precursors of the target proteins to be folded and in their absence the target protein molecules do not have enough information for proper self-folding (Inouye, Enzyme, 1991 45:314-321). Unique features of IMCs include: a) the IMC and the target protein are linked by a peptidyl bond forming a single polypeptide; b) the IMC is absolutely required for the formation of active conformation of the target protein, but not required for the function of the target protein; c) upon completion of the protein folding, the IMC is removed either by autoprocessing or by another endopeptidase; d) the IMC does not function as a catalyst, i.e., one IMC molecule is able to refold only one molecule of the target protein; and e) the IMC is a highly specific “tailor-made” polypeptide which works only for the target proteins (Inouye, Enzyme, 1991, 45:314-321).
      Recently, it has been shown that an IMC or propeptide can help the target protein fold intermolecularly, i.e., the IMC or propeptide is not linked to the target protein via a peptidyl bond, but rather is added to the folding reaction as a separate peptide (U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,021). However, it is noteworthy that the propeptide used in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,021 is the natural propeptide of the target protein or a propeptide of a polypeptide that has the same function of the target protein and the polypeptide also has an amino acid sequence that is similar to the target protein. In addition, the intermolecular reaction described in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,021 must be carried out in a buffered ionic aqueous medium favoring hydrophobic interaction.
      Examples of IMCs include the propeptides of subtilisin, α-lytic protease, carboxypeptidase Y and ubiquitin (Shinde and Inouye, TIBS, 1993, 18:442446). Certain characteristics of an IMC sequence of subtilisin include: a) the IMC contains a higher percentage of charged amino acid residues than the target protein; b) the distribution of these charged residues within the IMC is extremely uneven, i.e., the N-terminal half contains more positively charged residues than negatively charged residues and the C-terminal half contains more negatively charged residues than positively charged residues; c) Ser and Thr residues within the IMC are also unevenly distributed; d) the IMC contains a reactively high content of aromatic residues, and e) the IMC contains a hydrophobic sequence of 9 residues (Inouye, Enzyme, 1991, 45:314-321). A similar bias towards charged residues is also observed in α-lytic protease and carboxypeptidase Y (Inouye, Enzyme, 1991, 45:314-321).
1.2.2. Amino Acid Sequence of Mature Human Growth Hormone
      The amino acid sequence of mature human growth hormone (hGH) is disclosed in Ikehara et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1984, 81:5956-5960. There is no suggestion in the art that mature hGH or any portion thereof can function as an IMC or propeptide. Actually, mature hGH or any portion thereof can not be considered a propeptide at all because by definition, any pre, pro, or prepro sequence is removed from a mature sequence.
1.2.3. Human Insulin Structure
      Insulin is a well-defined peptide with known amino acid sequence and structural characteristics (Watson et al., Recombinant DNA—A Short Course; Scientific American Books, W. H. Freeman Co., New York, 1983, pp. 231-235; Norman and Litwack, In Hormones, Academic Press, New York, 1987, pp. 264-317). This hormone consists of two separate peptide chains which are the A chain (21 amino acids) and the B chain (30 amino acids) joined by disulfide bridges as indicated in FIG. 1B. Proinsulin is the biological precursor of insulin and is a single peptide chain formed when the A and B chains are connected by the C peptide (FIG. 1A).
1.2.4. Human Insulin Produced by Recombinant Methods
      Human insulin was the first animal protein made in bacteria in a sequence identical to that of the human pancreatic peptide (Watson et al., Recombinant DNA—A Short Course: Scientific American Books, W. H. Freeman Co., New York, 1983, pp. 231-235). The first successful expression of human insulin in laboratory was announced in 1978 and human insulin was approved as a therapeutic drug in 1982 (Johnson, Science, 1983, 219:632-637).
      1.2.4.1. Two-Chain Method
      According to this method, each insulin chain is produced as a β-galactosidase (β-gal) fusion protein in separate fermentations using E. Coli transformed with plasmids containing a DNA sequence encoding the A or B chain of human insulin, respectively. The products are intracellular and appeared in prominent cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Williams et al., Science, 1982, 215(5):687-689). Recombinant proteins produced in E. Coli usually represent 10-40% of the total protein (Burgess, Protein Engineering; Oxender, D. L., Fox, C. F., Eds.; Alan R. Liss, Inc.; New York, 1987; pp. 71-82.).
      Once removed from the inclusion bodies, chemical cleavage by CNBr at the Met residue between the β-galactosidase and the A or B chain, followed by purification, gave separate A and B peptides. The peptides are then combined and induced to fold at a ratio of 2:1 of A-B chain (S-sulfonated forms) in the presence of limited amounts of mercaptan in order to obtain an active hormone (Chance et al., In Peptides: Synthesis- Structure- Function, Rich D. M. Gross, E., Eds., Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill. 1981, pp.721-728, Frank and Chance, In Quo Vadis? Therapeutic Agents Produced by Genetic Engineering, Joyesuk et al., Eds., Sanoff Group, Toulouse-Labege, France, 1985, pp. 137-148). After 24 h, the yield is approximately 60% based on the amount of B chain used (Chance et al. In Insulins, Growth Hormone and Recombinant DNA Technology, Raven Press, New York. 1981, pp. 71-85; Johnson, Fluid Phase Equilib., 1986, 29: 109-123). Goeddel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1979, 76(1):106-110, obtained similar results with 20% of the total cellular protein expressed as either the A or B chain fusion protein. Subsequent folding of S-sulfonated chains give 50-80% correct folding.
      The large size of the β-gal fusion protein limits yields since the fusion protein of β-gal ( −1000 amino acids) and insulin A or B chain (21 or 30 amino acids, respectively) became detached from the cell's ribosome (premature chain termination during translation and therefore yields incomplete insulin peptides (Burnett, Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression, Inouye, Ed., Academic Press, New York, 1983, pp. 259-277; Hall. Invisible Frontiers—The Race to Synthesize a Human Gene, Atlantic Monthly Press, New York, 1987). A key improvement to this approach is the use of the tryptophan (Trp) operon in place of the lac operon (β-gal system) to obtain a smaller fusion protein. The Trp operon consists of a series of five bacterial genes which sequentially synthesize the enzymes responsible for the anabolism of tryptophan. One of these enzymes, Trp E, has only 190 amino acids compared to β-gal's 1000 amino acids. The Trp E gene followed by genes for the A or B chains of insulin has the added advantage of enhancing fusion protein production from 5-10% to 20-30% of the total protein (Hall, Invisible Frontiers—The Race to Synthesize a Human Gene, Atlantic Monthly Press, New York, 1987) since the Trp promoter is a strong promoter in E. Coli. This leads to at last 10-fold greater expression of polypeptide when compared to the lac (i.e., β-gal) system (Burnett, Experimental Manipulation of Gene Expression, Inouye, Ed., Academic Press, New York, 1983, pp. 259-277). The Trp operon is turned on when the E. Coli fermentation runs out of tryptophan (Hall, Invisible Frontiers—The Race to Synthesize a Human Gene, Atlantic Monthly Press, New York. 1987; Etienne-Decent, In Genetic Biochemistry: From Gene to Protein, Ellis Horwood Limited, Chichester, U.K., 1988, pp. 125-127). This characteristic is beneficial during fermentation since cell mass can first be maximized. Then, when appropriate, the cell's insulin production system can be turned on by allowing the fermentation media to become depleted in Trp.
      After fermentation is completed, the cells are recovered and disrupted. The cell debris is than separated from the inclusion bodies, and the inclusion bodies are dissolved in a solvent, although specifics are not known (Wheelwright, Protein Purification, Oxford University Press; New York, 1991, p. 217). Inclusion bodies are sometimes dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol (Burgess, Protein Engineering, Oxender and Fox, Eds., Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York, 1987, pp. 71-82). Next, the Trp-LE-Met-A chain and the Trp-LE-Met-B chain undergo a CNBr cleavage to release the A and B insulin chains. Further modifications of the A and B chains include oxidative sulfitolysis, purification and combination to produce crude insulin. This crude insulin is subjected to ion exchange, size exclusion, and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) to produce the purified recombinant human insulin (Frank and Chance, Munch Med. Wschr. 1983, 125(Suppl. 1):514-520).
      1.2.4.2. Proinsulin Method (Intracellular)
      Human insulin can also be made with recombinant microorganisms that produce intact proinsulin instead of the A or B chains separately (Kroeff et al., J. Chromatogr, 1989, 481:45-61). Initially, mRNA is copied into cDNA, and a methionine codon is chemically synthesized and attached to the 5′ end of the proinsulin cDNA. The cDNA is inserted into a bacterial gene in a plasmid vector that is introduced and then grown in E. Coli. Proinsulin can be released from the bacterial enzyme (β-gal) fragment (or alternatively from the Trp-LE/Met Proinsulin (Trp proinsulin) by destroying the methionine linker. The proinsulin chain is subjected to a folding process to form the correct intramolecular disulfide bridges, and the C peptide can then be cleaved with enzymes to yield human insulin (Frank and Chance, Munch Med. Wschr., 1983, 125(Suppl. 1):514-520). In comparison, the two-chain method previously described is more complex.
      Dorschug et al. constructed recombinant plasmid encoding fusion proteins containing a mini-proinsulin (B-Arg-A), expressed the fusion proteins in E.coli (inclusion body) and yeast (secreted), prepared correctly folded mini-proinsulin via BrCN cleavage and oxidative sulfitolysis, and converted the correctly folded mini-proinsulin into human insulin by treatment with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B (EP 0,347,781 B1; IL 9,562,511 B and AU 611,303 B2).
      Tottrup and Carlsen, Biotechnol. Bioeng, 1990, 35:339-348 used the yeast system in an optimized batch-fed fermentation, yields of the fusion protein of superoxide dismutase-human proinsulin (SOD-PI) were reported to be 1500 mg/L. SOD-PI would be the starting material for the production of recombinant human insulin; yields of the final product have not been reported.
      Recently, Castellanos-Serra et al., FEBS Letters, 1996, 378:171-176 expressed in E. Coli a proinsulin fusion protein carrying a modified interleukin-2 N-terminal peptide (1-22 amino acid residues) linked to the N-terminus of proinsulin by a lysine residue. The chimeric proinsulin was isolated from inclusion bodies, refolded via oxidative sulfitolysis, and then converted into the correctly fusion proteins insulin by prolonged reaction with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B. The IL2-proinsulin fusion can be folded correctly without first removing the IL2 fragment, thus eliminating the cyanogen bromide and the associated purification steps. However, the step of oxidative sulfitolysis and the associated purification steps cannot be avoided by the use of IL2-proinsulin fusion protein.
      1.2.4.3. Proinsulin Method (Secreted)
      Villa-Komaroff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S., 1978, 75(8):3727-3731 were first to describe a secretion system for human proinsulin in E. Coli. Thim et al. constructed recombinant plasmids encoding fusion proteins containing a modified yeast mating factor α I leader sequence and an insulin precursor (Thim et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1986, 83:6766-6770). The leader sequence serves to direct the fusion protein into the secretory pathway of the yeast cell and to expose the fusion protein to the Lys-Arg processing enzyme system. Partial processing also occurred at one or both dibasic sequences between B and A chains within proinsulin and other insulin precursors containing a short spacer peptide (containing 6 or more amino acid residues) in place of the C peptide. In contrast, no processing was observed in the absence of a spacer peptide in the insulin precursor molecule, e.g. B-Arg-Arg-A (where A and B are the A and B chain of human proinsulin, respectively). This type of single-chain insulin precursors could enzymatically be converted into insulin by treatment with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B Diers et al., Drug Biotechnology Regulations ( Scientific Basis and Practices), Chiu and Gueriguian, Eds., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1991, pp. 167-177, describe the unfolded peptide as a leader or prosegment, next a Lys-Arg sequence, the B chain (amino acids 1-29), a short peptide bridge, followed by the A chain (amino acids 1-21). In this precursor, amino acid 29 of the B chain of insulin is connected to amino acid 1 of the A chain by a short connecting peptide containing one basic amino acid adjacent to the A chain. Human insulin is produced through transpeptidation followed by hydrolysis of the ester bond formed. Several chromatography steps follow for further purification.
1.2.5. Folding of Insulin Precursors
      Human insulin is a protein possessing two amino acid chains of 51 amino acid residues in all. Six cysteine residues are present in the two amino acid chains, which in each case two cysteine residues being linked to each via a disulfide bond. Statistically, there are 15 possibilities of forming disulfide bridges within one human insulin molecule. However, only one of the 15 possibilities exists in biologically active human insulin with the following disulfide bridges: 1) A6-A11; 2) A7-B7; and 3) A20-B19.
      The formation of the disulfide bridges which are present in human insulin is effected by way of an intermediate, with the cysteine residues of the human insulin being provided with a sulfur protective group, e.g., with a S-sulfonate (—S—SO 3 −) group (EP 0,037,255). In addition, pig proinsulin in which the cysteine residues are present as thio residues (—SH) has been used to obtain proinsulin possessing correctly linked cysteine bridges ( Biochemistry, 1968, 60:622-629). Obermeier et al. described a process for obtaining proinsulin possessing correctly linked cysteine bridges from a corresponding proinsulin amino acid chain at a concentration of 0.05 to 0.3 g per liter in the presence of mercaptan, chaotropic auxiliary agents and hydrophobic absorber resins (U.S. Pat. No. 5,473,049). The step of oxidative sulfitolysis is eliminated in the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,473,049. However, the insulin protein can only be folded at a low concentration, which greatly diminishes the commercial value of this process. In addition, the use of large amount of mercaptan and hydrophobic absorber resins increase process complexity and down-stream purification costs. From the disclosure of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,473,049, it is unclear whether the benefit of eliminating the step of oxidative sulfitolysis step will outweigh the increased down-stream purification costs.

3. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2736339,"BACKGROUND
      Hemophilia B is an X-linked recessive inherited disease whose pathogenesis is a mutation in the human coagulation factor IX (FIX) gene located on the X chromosome, which results in a significant decrease in the content or activity of the coagulation factor in plasma, and thus impedes the intrinsic coagulation pathway and causes coagulation abnormalities. It is estimated that the total number of hemophilia B patients in China is about 20,000, accounting for 15%-20% of hemophilia. Hemophilia B affects one in 30000 males, while rarely occurs among females. The most common treatment currently used is FIX replacement therapy involving use of FIX enriched from plasma or expressed by recombinant cell.
      Human coagulation factor IX (FIX) is a serine protease zymogen containing 461 amino acids and is an important component of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. It is mainly synthesized in the liver and secreted into the plasma. FIX consists of a number of separate functional domains, including a signal peptide, a propeptide region, a Gla domain, two epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains, an activating peptide, and a tryptase catalytic domain (serine protease domain). The zymogen is further processed into an active form by binding the light and heavy chains thereof via a disulfide bonds to form a heterodimer. FIX plays an important role in the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Only activated FIXa activates FX together with activated FVIII (FVIIIa), phospholipids and Ca 2+ into FXa to initiate a common coagulation pathway and exert a clotting effect. More than 100 mutations in FIX have been recorded in the current study. Some of them do not cause any clinical symptoms, but others lead to significant bleeding disorders. If left untreated, hemophilia B can cause uncontrollable bleeding in muscles, joints and body cavities after injury and may lead to death. In the past, this disease was mainly treated by administrating FIX prepared from human plasma. However, on one hand the treatment brings a consequent risk of contracting blood-borne viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). On the other hand, native FIX has a short half-life in humans, which is about 18 to 24 hours. Patients need repetitive transfusions of blood or blood products, which is not only expensive, but also may cause severe blood transfusion reactions. Trace amount of activated factors in the thrombin zymogen complex may also activate the coagulation cascade, causing thrombosis and embolism. At present, the half-life of commercially available recombinant FIX is relatively short, only 18 hours, such that hemophilia patients need to receive frequent intravenous administration in the emergency on-demand treatment after hemorrhage or in the prophylaxis before hemorrhage. Hemophilia B patients are recommended to receive an injection of FIX at a dose of 40100 IU/kg 2 or 3 times a week to prevent bleeding events. Therefore, the development of long-acting recombinant FIX preparations with extended the half-life in plasma can not only reduce the number of administrations, but also reduce the physical and mental burden of patients, and greatly improve patient compliance.
      To extend the in vivo functional half-life of FIX, half-life extending moieties such as PEG, human serum albumin (HSA), XTEN, CTP or IgG Fc have been linked to the FIX in the prior art. For example, N9-GP (PEGylated) from Novo Nordisk, FIX-FP (a HSA fusion protein) from CSL Behring and the long-acting FIX-CTP (a CTP fusion protein) from OPKO/Prolor have entered clinical trials. Clinical trials of N9-GP showed that the half-life of FIX was prolonged by 5 times (with an average half-life of 110 h) after a total of 3 administrations. However, one patient with severe hypersensitivity reaction and three patients with development of non-inhibitory antibodies were observed in the trial. The immunogenicity of N9-GP remains to be further studied (Collins P W et al, Blood, 2014, 124(26): 3880-3886). Clinical trials of FIX-FP showed that the half-life of FIX-FP was 89-96 hours, and no special immune response occurred in patients. Studies on FIX-CTP in a hemophilia B mouse model showed that the half-life of FIX was prolonged by 4 times and the bleeding frequency and duration was decreased, but the activity of FIX was also reduced (Hart Get. al., Haemophilia, 2012, 18: 32). The first fusion protein of FIX with Fc (FIX-Fc) was approved by the U.S. FDA in March 2014 under the trade name Alprolix (Biogen Idec) and is currently the only approved recombinant long-acting FIX drug. Alprolix is a fusion protein formed by covalently binding a single FIX molecule to the N-terminus of the double-stranded Fc fragment of human IgG1, and is recombinantly expressed by HEK-293H cells. Clinical studies have shown that Alprolix has a half-life of 57-86 hours, and the administration frequency thereof can be once every 7 or 10 days when used for prophylaxis. Currently, Alprolix has been approved for listing in several countries around the world. However, the fusion of Fc inevitably causes a decrease in specific activity. The in vitro activity determination confirmed that the molar specific activity of FIX-Fc (IU/nmol) was only 50% of that of FIX (BeneFIX®) (Peters R T et. al., Blood, 2010, 115(10):2057-64).
      CTP is a short peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) beta subunit. It has been shown to have the ability to extend in vivo half-lives. Chinese Patent Nos. CN103539860A and CN103539861A disclosed a fusion protein in which CTP is used as a linker to link the β subunit and the α subunit of FSH to prolong the in vivo half-life of the fusion protein. Patent WO2013121416 disclosed a long-acting coagulation factor IX comprising at least one CTP linked to the carboxyl terminus of coagulation factor IX. The FIX-(CTP) 3, which contains three tandem CTPs, exhibits improved pharmacokinetic properties relative to rhFIX, FIX-CTP or FIX-CTP-CTP; FIX-CTP has a comparable in vitro activity and half-life to rhFIX; and the half-life of FIX-CTP-CTP is 3 times that of rhFIX, and the half-life of FIX-(CTP) 3 is 2.5-4 times that of rhFIX in rats and FIX-deficient mice. However, FIX-(CTP) 3 shows reduced clotting activity in the in vivo coagulation assay. In addition, compared with BeneFIX, the clotting activity of FIX-(CTP) 3 is delayed for 1 hour, which may because that the addition of three tandem CTPs may mask the activation site of FIX, thereby delaying the cascade.
      The present inventors do not use CTP alone as a linker or as a half-life prolonging moiety as suggested by the prior art, but instead connect it to a flexible peptide linker (e.g., (GGGGS)n) to form a hybrid linker peptide composed of a flexible peptide linker comprising GS and a rigid CTP peptide linker comprising a plurality of glycosyl side chains. The hybrid linker peptide linker is located between FIX and the half-life prolonging moiety (e.g., the immunoglobulin Fc fragment, which does not contain the CTP as suggested by the prior art) to constitute a new FIX fusion protein, not only further prolonging the half-life, but also reducing the immunogenicity, improving the bioavailability, greatly reducing the steric hindrance effect of the fusion ligand Fc on FIX, and maintaining good biological activity and function.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      The present invention provides a highly-glycosylated, homodimeric Fc fusion protein of coagulation factor IX (FIX). The fusion protein has a prolonged in vivo active half-life, low immunogenicity, and similar biological activity to a recombinant FIX. In addition, the present invention provides a method for efficiently and stably expressing the fusion protein. The fusion protein expressed by the method has advantages of high yield, good stability during preparation and storage, and similar biological activity to recombinant FIXs on the market.
      In one aspect of the present invention, a highly-glycosylated FIX fusion protein is provided, which comprises, in order from the N-terminus to C-terminus, human coagulation factor IX (hFIX), a flexible peptide linker (Linker, L), at least one rigid unit comprising the carboxyl terminal peptide of human chorionic gonadotropin β subunit (CTP) and a half-life extending moiety (such as an immunoglobulin Fc fragment, an albumin, a transferrin or PEG, preferably a human IgG Fc variant (indicated as vFc)). In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the fusion protein is indicated as hFIX-L-CTP-vFc.
      The hFIX is a wild-type hFIX or a mutant thereof. Further, the wild type hFIX has the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Preferably, the hFIX mutant is at least 85% homologous to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. More preferably, the hFIX mutant is at least 90% homologous to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Most preferably, the hFIX mutant is at least 95% homologous to the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.
      The flexible peptide linker is preferably non-immunogenic and can generate sufficient spatial distance between hFIX and Fc to minimize the steric effects between each other. Preferably, a flexible peptide linker consisting of two or more amino acid residues selected from the group consisting of Gly (G), Ser (S), Ala (A) and Thr (T) is used. Preferably, the flexible peptide linker comprises residues G and S. The length of the linker peptide plays a very important role in the activity of the fusion protein. For the purposes of the present invention, the peptide linker may preferably comprise a general formula of the amino acid sequence formed by combining repetitive units (GS) a(GGS) b(GGGS) c(GGGGS) d, wherein each a, b, c, and d is an integer equal to or greater than 0, and a+b+c+d≥1.
      Specifically, in some embodiments of the present invention, the peptide linker may preferably comprise the following sequences:

      The CTP rigid unit is selected from a full-length sequence consisting of carboxyl-terminal amino acids 113 to 145 of human chorionic gonadotropin β subunit, or a fragment thereof. Specifically, the CTP rigid unit comprises the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 or a truncated sequence thereof. First, the CTP peptide which occurs naturally in the human body is non-immunogenic. Second, compared to the random coil of a flexible peptide linker, the rigid CTP peptide linker containing multiple glycosylation sites can form a stable steric conformation, which facilitates FIX and the Fc segment to fold independently into correct three-dimensional conformations without affecting the individual biological activities of each other. Moreover, the glycosyl side chains of CTP have a protective effect that can reduce the sensitivity of the peptide linker to proteases.
      Preferably, the CTP rigid unit contains at least 2 glycosylation sites. For example, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the CTP rigid unit contains 2 glycosylation sites. Illustratively, the CTP rigid unit contains N-terminal 10 amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 2, i.e. SSSS*KAPPPS*; alternatively, the CTP rigid unit contains C-terminal 14 amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 2, i.e. S*RLPGPS*DTPILPQ. As another example, in another embodiment, the CTP rigid unit contains 3 glycosylation sites. Illustratively, the CTP rigid unit contains N-terminal 16 amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 2, i.e. SSSS*KAPPPS*LPSPS*R. As another example, in other embodiments, the CTP rigid unit contains 4 glycosylation sites. Illustratively, the CTP rigid unit contains 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33 amino acids, starting from position 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, or 118 and ending at position 145 of the human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit. Specifically, the CTP rigid unit contains N-terminal 28 amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 2, i.e. SSSS*KAPPPS*LPSPS*RLPGPS*DTPILPQ. Herein, represents a glycosylation site. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.
      In other embodiments, the CTP rigid unit provided by the present invention is at least 70% homologous to the amino acid sequence of native CTP. In other embodiments, the CTP rigid unit provided by the present invention is at least 80% homologous to the amino acid sequence of native CTP. In other embodiments, the CTP rigid unit provided by the present invention is at least 90% homologous to the amino acid sequence of native CTP. In other embodiments, the CTP rigid unit provided by the present invention is at least 95% homologous to the amino acid sequence of native CTP.
      In specific embodiments of the present invention, the CTP rigid unit may preferably comprise the following sequences:

      In some embodiments of the present invention, the fusion protein comprises one CTP rigid unit as described above. In other embodiments of the present invention, the fusion protein may comprise 2 or more, preferably 2, 3, 4 or 5, CTP rigid units as described above. For example, in an embodiment of the present invention, the fusion protein comprises 2 CTP 3 rigid units: SSSSKAPPPSSSSSKAPPPS (CTP 3-CTP 3, or expressed as (CTP 3) 2).
      The half-life extending moiety is preferably selected from the group consisting of Fc fragments of immunoglobulin IgG, IgM, and IgA, more preferably from the group consisting of Fc fragments of human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 and variants thereof. Further, the human IgG Fc variant comprises at least one amino acid modification in the wild-type human IgG Fc and has reduced effector function (ADCC and/or CDC effects) and/or enhanced binding affinity to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Further, the human IgG Fc variant may be selected from the group consisting of:
      (i) vFcγ1: hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of human IgG1 with mutations Leu234Val, Leu235Ala, and Pro331Ser (the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3);
      (ii) vFcγ2-1: hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of human IgG2 with mutation Pro331Ser (the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4);
      (iii) vFcγ2-2: hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of human IgG2 with mutations Thr250Gln and Met428Leu (the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 5);
      (iv) vFcγ2-3: hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of human IgG2 with mutations Pro331Ser, Thr250Gln and Met428Leu (the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 6).
      (iv) vFcγ4: hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of human IgG4 with mutations Ser228Pro and Leu235Ala (the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 7).
      The Fc variant (vFc) in the fusion protein of the present invention comprises hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of human IgG such as human IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4. The CH2 region contains amino acid mutations at positions 228, 234, 235 and 331 (as defined by the EU numbering system). It is believed that these amino acid mutations reduce the effector functions of Fc. Human IgG2 Fc does not bind to FcγR but shows extremely weak complement activity. An Fcγ2 variant with mutation Pro331Ser should have less complement activity than native Fcγ2 while remain as a non-binder to FcγR. IgG4 Fc is deficient in activating the complement cascade, and its binding affinity to FcγR is about an order of magnitude lower than that of IgG1. An Fcγ4 variant with mutation Leu235Ala should exhibit minimal effector functions as compared to the native Fcγ4. An Fcγ1 variant with mutations Leu234Val, Leu235Ala and Pro331Ser also should exhibit decreased effector functions than the native Fcγ1. These Fc variants are more suitable for the preparation of FIX fusion proteins than native human IgG Fcs. The amino acid mutations at positions 250 and 428, as defined by the EU numbering system, increase the binding affinity of the Fc region to the neonatal receptor FcRn, thereby further prolonging the half-life (Paul R et al., J Biol Chem, 2004, 279:6213-6216). The above two types of functional variants are combined or added on each other to generate new combination variants to reduce the effector functions while prolonging the half-life. The Fc variants of the present invention contain mutations at, but not limited to, the above-described sites. Substitutions may be introduced at other sites such that Fcs have reduced effector functions and/or enhanced binding affinity to FcRn. Such substitutions should not lead to a decrease in the function/activity or undesirable conformational changes of the Fc variants. Common mutation sites may be found in Shields R L et al., J Biol Chem, 2001,276(9):6591-604.

      Further, in step (d), the fusion protein is purified by a four-step chromatography procedure, i.e., affinity chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and molecular sieve chromatography. The present invention further gives preferred purification conditions in Example 5.
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fusion protein prepared by the above method has an activity of >200 IU/mg.
      According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided use of the fusion protein in the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of a hemorrhagic disease or event resulting from a deficiency or functional defect of FIX, comprising use in the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of a hemorrhagic disease in a patient with congenital or acquired FIX deficiency, and use in the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of spontaneous or surgical bleeding in a patient with hemophilia B.
      The present inventors have found that the fusion proteins and their preparation methods as described and/or disclosed in the present invention have the following advantages:
      1. The human IgG Fc variant which is used in the fusion protein as a fusion ligand is non-lytic and reduces the effector function triggered by binding to FcγRs and Clq.
      2. Compared to recombinant FIXs, the fusion protein of the present invention can be expected to have reduced immunogenicity, which results in decreased production of neutralizing antibodies in patients.
      3. The fusion protein of the present invention has good stability during fermentation, purification and storage.
      4. The fusion protein provided by the present invention contains a rigid CTP peptide containing multiple glycosyl side chains. The rigid CTP peptide can form a stable steric conformation compared to the random coil of flexible linkers such as (GGGGS)n. This “block” effect causes the FIX and Fc fragment to fold independently into correct three-dimensional conformations without affecting the biological activities of each other. The highly sialylated, negatively charged CTP which contain glycosyl groups can resist the clearance by the kidney, thereby prolonging the half-life of the fusion protein. Moreover, the protective effect of the glycosyl side chains of CTP reduces the sensitivity of the peptide linker to proteases, such that the fusion protein is less susceptible to degradation in the linking region.
      5. The preparation method of the fusion protein provided by the present invention is high-yield. After culturing in a 300 ml shake flask for 14 days, the cumulative yield can reach at least 200 mg/L. The method can be scaled up for large-scale industrial production.
      6. Compared with the monomer-dimer heterozygous (Monomeric) FIX fusion protein constructed by Biogen, the expression and purification of the fusion protein constructed by the present invention are more efficient and convenient, significantly reducing the production cost. Biogen constructed a binary expression vector of rFIXFc and Fc, wherein the Fc molecular was labeled with Flag (EP Patent Publication No. EP162489161). The fermentation broth of the expressed fusion protein was expected to contain three forms of products, a homodimeric (Dimeric) fusion protein (FIX-Fc:FIX-Fc), a monomer-dimer heterozygous (Monomeric) fusion protein (FIX-Fc:FLAG-Fc), and a dimer (FLAG-Fc:FLAG-Fc). On one hand, during expression of the fusion protein, since the host cells need to simultaneously express single chain molecules of both FIX-Fc and Fc, and then the molecules should bind to each other to form the three products as described above, such that the final expression efficiency of the target product is greatly reduced. In addition, during the purification, side impurities in the other two forms have to be removed, which makes the purification more complex and makes the production efficiency low, and greatly increases the production cost. Compared to the Monomeric rFIXFc fusion protein developed by Biogen, the preparation method of the present invention has certain technical and price advantages. The expression and purification of the present invention are simpler and more efficient and the production cost is lower.

      In spite of numerous advances in medical research, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. Traditional modes of clinical care, such as surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, have a significant failure rate, especially for solid tumors. Failure occurs either because the initial tumor is unresponsive, or because of recurrence due to regrowth at the original site or metastasis. Cancer remains a central focus for medical research and development.
      Immunotherapy of cancer has been explored for over a century, but it is only in the last decade that various antibody-based products have been introduced into the management of patients with diverse forms of cancer. At present, this is one of the most active areas of clinical research, with numerous antibody therapeutic products already approved in oncology.
      Using specific antibodies as therapeutic agents offers advantages over the non-targeted therapies such as systemic chemotherapy via oral or intravenous administration of drugs or radiation therapy. There are two types of antibody-based therapies. The more common type is to identify a tumor antigen (i.e., a protein expressed on tumors and cancer cells and not in normal tissues) and develop an antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed to the tumor antigen. One can then conjugate any therapeutic agent, such as a chemotherapeutic agent, a radionuclide, modified toxin, etc., to this antibody to achieve targeted therapy by the therapeutic agent to the tumor. The other kind of antibody based therapy is by providing an antibody which in itself has therapeutic properties against the tumor/cancer cells it targets. The added advantage of this second form of antibody-based therapy is that one may additionally conjugate another therapeutic agent to the therapeutic antibody to achieve a more effective treatment. The major advantage with any antibody-directed therapy and of therapy using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in particular, is the ability to deliver increased doses of a therapeutic agent to a tumor, with greater sparing of normal tissue from the side effects of the therapeutic agent.
      Despite the identification of several antibodies for cancer therapies, there is still a need to identify new and more effective therapeutics to overcome immune tolerance and activate T cell responses. Further, even though molecular engineering has improved the prospects for such antibody-based therapeutics issues still remain regarding continuity in the generated recombinant products.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention provides for a novel and consistent synthesis method for generating homogeneous recombinant fusion immunomodulatory molecules, and more specifically, recombinant chimeric polypeptides including targeting antibodies linked to immunomodulatory proteins.
      To mediate an immune response against cancer, T cell activation and co-stimulation are both important. Co-stimulation of T cells is mainly mediated through engaging of CD28 with its ligands of B7 family on antigen presenting cells (APCs). However, after activation, T cells express a molecule called Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which binds to B7 ligands with much more affinity than CD28 and such binding down-modulates T cell activity. Thus, including an antibody that binds to the CTLA-4 receptor would block interaction with ligands of the B7 family and enhance anti-tumor response.
      Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PDL1), one of the B7 ligands discussed above, obstructs anti-tumor immunity by (i) tolerizing tumor-reactive T cells by binding to its receptor PD1 (CD279) on T cells; (ii) rendering tumor cells resistant to CD8+ T cell and FasL-mediated lysis by PD-1 signaling through tumor cell-expressed PDL1; and (iii) promoting the development and maintenance of induced T regulatory cells. Therefore, PDL1 is a major obstacle to natural anti-tumor immunity and to cancer immunotherapies requiring activation of host T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. This concept is supported by studies demonstrating that antibody blocking of PDL1-PD1 interactions improves T cell activation and reduces tumor progression. Although antibodies to PDL1 or PD1 have shown therapeutic efficacy in a subset of cancer patients, the majority of patients do not benefit from antibody treatment. Thus, there is needed a mechanism for regulating PD-L1 function that will lead to a new universally applicable treatment for minimizing PD-L1-mediated immune suppression in cancer patients and that is more effective than currently available mAbs to PD-1 or PD-L1.
      A characteristic of many epithelial cancers, such as, cancers of the colon, head and neck, breast, ovary, non-small cell lung (NSCL), and pancreas, is abnormally high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of cancer cells. The family of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR; HER1, HER2/neu, HER3, and HER4) includes cell membrane receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that trigger a cascade of biophysiological signaling reactions in response to the binding of different ligands. These receptors play a key role in the behavior of malignant cells in a variety of human tumors, inducing increased proliferation, decreasing apoptosis, and enhancing tumor cell motility and angiogenesis. Thus, the present invention includes antibodies targeting EGFR family members.
      The present invention further provides methods of reducing growth of cancer cells by counteracting immune tolerance of cancer cells, wherein T cells remain active and inhibit the recruitment of T-regulatory that are known to suppress the immune system's response to the tumor. Thus, the chimeric polypeptides generated by the polynucleotides sequences of the present invention are useful for treating cancer because of the expressed fusion or chimeric polypeptides.
      In one aspect, the present invention provides for chimeric polypeptides containing at least one targeting moiety to target a cancer cell and at least one immunomodulating moiety that counteracts immune tolerance of cancer cell, wherein the targeting moiety and the immunomodulating moiety are linked by an amino acid spacer of sufficient length of amino acid residues so that both moieties can successfully bond to their individual target. In the alternative, the targeting moiety and the immunomodulating moiety that counteract immune tolerance of cancer cell may be bound directly to each other. The chimeric/fusion polypeptides of the invention are useful for binding to a cancer cell receptor and reducing the ability of cancer cells to avoid an immune response.
      Preferably the targeting moiety is an antibody having binding affinity for CTLA-4 or EGFR1, wherein the antibody is transcribed from a polynucleotide sequence lacking nucleotides for expression of the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain of the expressed antibody. It has been discovered that by removing the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain of an antibody during transcription that the end product exhibits increased homogeneity, thereby reducing the need and costs for further purification.
      It is known that during the process of transcription and translation of an IgG molecule in CHO cells, the lysine (K) at the C-terminal of the heavy chain will be expressed. In the commercial product such expressed lysines have to be removed to increase purity. There is much heterogeneity in the produced product, as shown in FIG. 1. This occurs because the CHO cell has an endogenous enzyme Carboxypeptidase B (CPB) which will cleave the C-terminal lysine as long as the expressed antibody is still available intracellularly. However, this enzyme will not cleave the lysine once the antibody is secreted into the medium. Thus, the cleavage efficiency of this endogenous CPB is based on the availability within the cell. As such, some of the antibodies will be secreted with the lysine and some will not, and such combination will cause significant heterogeneity in the secreted product, that being some antibodies with the C-terminal lysine and some without. As the recombinant product is being used for the therapeutic use, one needs to purify to homogeneity. Thus, the recombinant products of the prior art requires additional purification steps wherein the recombinant product need to be treated with the enzyme CPB first and purified once again using an additional step to remove any lysine and the enzyme CPB from the final product. These additional steps add a significant cost to the manufacturing process.
      The present invention avoids the shortcomings of previous methods of synthesizing recombinant anti-CTLA-4 and anti-EGFR1 antibodies by transcribing an expressed protein from a polynucleotide sequence lacking nucleotides for expression of the C-terminal lysine at the heavy chain of the expressed antibody.
      The present invention is based on preparing chimeric/fusion proteins by expression of polynucleotides encoding the fusion proteins that counteract or reverse immune tolerance of cancer cells. Cancer cells are able to escape elimination by chemotherapeutic agents or tumor-targeted antibodies via specific immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and such ability of cancer cells is recognized as immune tolerance. Such immunosuppressive mechanisms include immunosuppressive cytokines (for example, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)) and regulatory T cells and/or immunosuppressive myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). By counteracting tumor-induced immune tolerance, the present invention provides effective compositions and methods for cancer treatment, optional in combination with another existing cancer treatment. The present invention provides strategies to counteract tumor-induced immune tolerance and enhance the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy by activating and leveraging T cell-mediated adaptive antitumor against resistant or disseminated cancer cells.
      In another aspect, the present invention provides a molecule including at least one targeting moiety fused with at least one immunomodulatory moiety. The targeting moiety specifically binds a target molecule, and the immunomodulatory moiety specifically binds one of the following molecules: (i) Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) and or (ii) Programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1).

Further, a heavy or light chain of an antibody targeting moiety may be linked to an immunomodulatory moiety which in turn can be further linked to a second immunomodulatory moiety wherein there is a linker between the two immunomodulatory moieties.
      In a still further aspect, there is provided a chimeric polypeptide that comprised a tumor targeting moiety and an immunomodulatory moiety comprising a molecule that binds transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), wherein the tumor targeting moiety is an antibody that binds to EGFR1, where in the antibody can be the full antibody, heavy chain or light chain.

Thus, the present invention includes antibodies targeting EGFR family members.
      The present invention further provides methods of reducing growth of cancer cells by counteracting immune tolerance of cancer cells, wherein T cells remain active and inhibit the recruitment of T-regulatory that are known to suppress the immune system's response to the tumor. Thus, the chimeric polypeptides generated by the polynucleotides sequences of the present invention are useful for treating cancer because of the expressed fusion or chimeric polypeptides.
      In one aspect, the present invention provides for chimeric polypeptides containing at least one targeting moiety to target a cancer cell and at least one immunomodulating moiety that counteracts immune tolerance of cancer cell, wherein the targeting moiety and the immunomodulating moiety are linked by an amino acid spacer of sufficient length of amino acid residues so that both moieties can successfully bond to their individual target. In the alternative, the targeting moiety and the immunomodulating moiety that counteract immune tolerance of cancer cell may be bound directly to each other. The chimeric/fusion polypeptides of the invention are useful for binding to a cancer cell receptor and reducing the ability of cancer cells to avoid an immune response.
      Preferably the targeting moiety is an antibody having binding affinity for CTLA-4 or EGFR1, wherein the antibody is transcribed from a polynucleotide sequence lacking nucleotides for expression of the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain of the expressed antibody. It has been discovered that by removing the C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain of an antibody during transcription that the end product exhibits increased homogeneity, thereby reducing the need and costs for further purification.
      It is known that during the process of transcription and translation of an IgG molecule in CHO cells, the lysine (K) at the C-terminal of the heavy chain will be expressed. In the commercial product such expressed lysines have to be removed to increase purity. There is much heterogeneity in the produced product, as shown in FIG. 1. This occurs because the CHO cell has an endogenous enzyme Carboxypeptidase B (CPB) which will cleave the C-terminal lysine as long as the expressed antibody is still available intracellularly. However, this enzyme will not cleave the lysine once the antibody is secreted into the medium. Thus, the cleavage efficiency of this endogenous CPB is based on the availability within the cell. As such, some of the antibodies will be secreted with the lysine and some will not, and such combination will cause significant heterogeneity in the secreted product, that being some antibodies with the C-terminal lysine and some without. As the recombinant product is being used for the therapeutic use, one needs to purify to homogeneity. Thus, the recombinant products of the prior art requires additional purification steps wherein the recombinant product need to be treated with the enzyme CPB first and purified once again using an additional step to remove any lysine and the enzyme CPB from the final product. These additional steps add a significant cost to the manufacturing process.
      The present invention avoids the shortcomings of previous methods of synthesizing recombinant anti-CTLA-4 and anti-EGFR1 antibodies by transcribing an expressed protein from a polynucleotide sequence lacking nucleotides for expression of the C-terminal lysine at the heavy chain of the expressed antibody.
      The present invention is based on preparing chimeric/fusion proteins by expression of polynucleotides encoding the fusion proteins that counteract or reverse immune tolerance of cancer cells. Cancer cells are able to escape elimination by chemotherapeutic agents or tumor-targeted antibodies via specific immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment and such ability of cancer cells is recognized as immune tolerance. Such immunosuppressive mechanisms include immunosuppressive cytokines (for example, Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)) and regulatory T cells and/or immunosuppressive myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). By counteracting tumor-induced immune tolerance, the present invention provides effective compositions and methods for cancer treatment, optional in combination with another existing cancer treatment. The present invention provides strategies to counteract tumor-induced immune tolerance and enhance the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy by activating and leveraging T cell-mediated adaptive antitumor against resistant or disseminated cancer cells.

Further, a heavy or light chain of an antibody targeting moiety may be linked to an immunomodulatory moiety which in turn can be further linked to a second immunomodulatory moiety wherein there is a linker between the two immunomodulatory moieties.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2662667,"BACKGROUND
      A need exists for improved influenza vaccines. Current vaccine strategies against influenza focus on generating robust antibody (humoral) responses against hemagglutinins. Because of the high degree of antigenic drift among circulating influenza strains over the course of a year, vaccine strains must be reformulated specifically for each influenza season. Although annual (or seasonal) influenza vaccines are successful to varying degrees in different age categories, more effective protection is clearly needed particularly for the young and the elderly. Furthermore, there is a major, permanent risk that reassortant viruses will evolve which have acquired very different HA (hemagglutinin) genes in a process known as “antigenic shift”. This would create a public health emergency, as current influenza vaccines rely essentially on the HA antigen.
      Influenza is an enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus in the Orthomyxoviridae family of viruses, divided into 3 major types: A, B, and C. Influenza A viruses infect a wide variety of animals, including humans, birds, pigs, horses, bats and many others, although the tropism of any particular influenza virus is generally highly adapted to a particular host. Influenza B viruses infect a smaller number of species, namely humans and seals, but are still a substantial cause of annual influenza epidemics. Most human influenza infections are caused by influenza A or B; influenza C viruses, which infect humans and pigs, rarely account for serious human infections or epidemics (Lamb).
      The current inactivated influenza virus vaccines induce antibodies that protect against closely related virus strains. Currently licensed vaccines mainly induce strain-specific neutralizing antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA), the main antigenic determinant on the surface of the virus, which is highly immunogenic, and can prevent disease caused by infection with a matching virus strain. However, HA has substantial antigenic variation which excludes its use alone in a vaccine designed to provide broad protection. For this reason, alternative vaccine strategies that generate protective responses directed against less variable targets are of great interest.
      Natural infection with influenza A virus induces both humoral and cellular immunity. Long-lasting cellular immunity is directed predominantly against conserved, internal viral proteins, such as the nucleoprotein (NP). NP antigen is immunogenic in humans following natural infections, but the cytotoxic T lymphocytes that are induced have a short life-span (McMichael a, McMichael b).
      Cellular immunity against NP is valuable, as it is directed against different variants of NP epitopes, and NP-targeting DNA vaccines have induced cross-protective immunity in animals (Schotsaert).
      The nucleoprotein (NP) antigen has long been recognized as a highly conserved antigen: even the most divergent influenza A strains share 90% identity in the NP proteins they encode (Gorman, Xu). Antigenic changes to NP are rare and only occur to a minor extent (Staneková).
PRIOR ART
Use of the Nucleoprotein as an Antigen in Vaccines
      The use of influenza nucleoprotein as an antigen was described in the 1980s (Wraith). Cellular immune responses in mice against NP are capable of inducing immunity, and notably of producing cross-protection against divergent type A viruses. It was shown that immunization of mice with NP purified from a H3N2 virus could provide substantial protection (75%) from a lethal heterologous (H1N1) challenge, but it did not prevent infection.
      DNA vaccines using the NP gene have been known for twenty years: they were used in the first “proof of concept” experiments for DNA vaccination itself (Ulmer).
      The expression of NP from a viral vector was first demonstrated in the 1980s (Yewdell 1985), and immunization with this vector was associated with an improved generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes against diverse influenza A, but not B, strains, in comparison with DNA vaccines. Since, it has been shown that immunization of mice with an MVA vector expressing the PR8 nucleoprotein protected them against low dose challenges by heterosubtypic influenza viruses (Altstein). More recently, a viral vector encoding the NP protein fused to the M1 protein has been used to immunize humans (Lillie, Berthoud, Antrobus). These studies showed notably that cellular immune responses to NP can be substantially boosted in older humans (Antrobus), when humoral responses are declining through immunosenescence.
      Secretion of the Nucleoprotein
      Some studies have suggested that the NP protein is primarily located in the nucleus, reducing the immunogenicity of such DNA vaccines (Staneková).
      Improved cellular immune responses against NP can be obtained by forcing the secretion of NP, for example by fusing a tPA signal peptide to the NP gene (Luo), by formulation of the DNA (Greenland, Sullivan) and by the use of electroporation (Laddy) to improve DNA delivery.
      Monomeric Influenza Nucleoproteins
      The preferred use of monomeric antigens in fusion with C4bp oligomerisation domains was described in the patent application WO 2005/014654. But the risk in using monomerised antigens is their decreased immunogenicity. This was demonstrated by Bachmann and colleagues with the glycoprotein G of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (Bachmann 1993), and for the influenza antigen Neuraminidase, or NA, by Fiers and colleagues (Fiers 2001). It is to be expected that decreasing or removing higher order structure from influenza nucleoproteins would decrease their immunogenicity.
      A number of mutations have been shown to transform the influenza nucleoprotein, which naturally oligomerizes, into a monomeric form (Ye 2006). Monomeric versions of NP described in this 2006 paper were confirmed to be monomeric in more recent papers (Tarus, Ye 2012). The two point mutations described in these papers which render monomeric the nucleoprotein of influenza A, are conserved in the nucleoproteins of influenza B and C strains (see FIG. 3 in Nakada). Therefore the same point mutations could be introduced in nucleoproteins of influenza B and C strains, in order to render monomeric these other influenza nucleoproteins. But no studies of the immunogenicity of the monomeric nucleoproteins were carried out.
      The major technical problem in preparing influenza vaccines with the NP antigen is inducing strong and durable cellular immune responses. The ‘cellular immune response’ is an immune response that does not involve antibodies but rather involves the activation of antigen-specific T-lymphocytes, and especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen. CD4 cells or helper T cells provide protection against different pathogens by secreting cytokines that activate the immune response. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8) cause death by apoptosis of pathogens without using cytokines.
      Although debate remains as to whether CD4 or CD8 responses against NP are more important for protection (Epstein), there is a consensus that cellular, rather than humoral, responses to the nucleoprotein are the key to the protection that this antigen can induce (Thomas). Vaccines that provide protection by eliciting a strong cytotoxic T cell response may be useful when T cell epitopes are derived from the highly conserved NP protein (Epstein; Roy). Cellular immune responses, mediated by T lymphocytes, mainly function by recognizing influenza virus-infected cells, by inhibiting viral replication and by accelerating virus clearance.
      The specific T cells involved in conferring immunity include both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and often exert their functions through the action of secreted cytokines and cytolytic activity, respectively. Influenza NP-specific CD8+ CTL in particular could play important roles in heterosubtypic protective immunity against a lethal influenza virus challenge in mice (Gschoesser), including clearance of the influenza virus from the upper respiratory mucosal surfaces (Mbawuike), promoting survival and recovery after challenge (Epstein). An optimal NP-based vaccine would improve both CD4 and CD8 cellular responses.
      This patent application provides methods for improving cellular immune responses to influenza virus nucleoproteins.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
201100062,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a major class of proteins responsible for transducing a signal within a cell. Upon binding of a ligand to an extracellular portion of a GPCR, a signal is transduced within the cell that results in a change in a biological or physiological property of the cell. GPCRs, along with G-proteins and effectors (intracellular enzymes and channels modulated by G-proteins), are the components of a modular signaling system that connects the state of intracellular second messengers to extracellular inputs.
      GPCR genes and gene-products are potential causative agents of disease. For example, specific defects in the rhodopsin gene and the V2 vasopressin receptor gene have been shown to cause various forms of retinitis pigmentosum, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These receptors are important to both the central nervous system and peripheral physiological processes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2769513,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Dual Signaling Proteins (DSP), also known as Signal-Converting-Proteins (SCP), which are currently known in the as bi-functional fusion proteins that link an extracellular portion of a type I membrane protein (extracellular amino-terminus), to an extracellular portion of a type II membrane protein (extracellular carboxyl-terminus), forming a fusion protein with two active sides (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,569,663 and 8,039,437, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein).
      PD1 is a surface co-inhibitory receptor of the immunoglobulin super family. PD1 is expressed on T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells and many tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). PD1 has two ligands: PDL1 (also named B7H1; CD274) and PDL2 (B7DC; CD273), that are both co-inhibitory. PDL1 is expressed on resting T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, macrophage, vascular endothelial cells and pancreatic islet cells. PDL1 is also known to be expressed in various types of cancers, especially in NSCLC, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, hepatocellular as well as cutaneous and various leukemia cancers, multiple myeloma and others. PDL2 expression is seen on macrophages and dendritic cells alone and is far less prevalent than PDL1 across tumor types. The expression of PDL1 is induced by multiple proinflammatory molecules, including types I and II IFN-γ, TNF-α, LPS, GM-CSF and VEGF, as well as the cytokines IL-10 and IL-4, with IFN-γ being the most potent inducer. The tumor micro-environment upregulates PDL1 expression, thereby, promoting immune suppression. In response to immune attack, cancer cells overexpress PDL1, which binds to PD1 receptor on T cells, inhibiting the activation of T-cells, thus suppressing T-cell attack and inducing tumor immune escape. PD1/PDL1 pathway regulates immune suppression by several mechanisms:
Induce apoptosis of activated T cells
Restrain cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL-CD8) activity
Inhibit the proliferation of T cells
Facilitate T cell anergy and exhaustion
Enhance the function of regulatory T cells
Restrain impaired T cell activation and IL-2 production.
Induce apoptosis of activated T cells

Restrain impaired T cell activation and IL-2 production.
      41BBL is the activating ligand of the 41BB receptor (CD137), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and a potent activation-induced T cell costimulatory molecule. 41BBL naturally forms a homo-trimer but signaling via 41BB requires significant oligomerization of 41BBL. 41BBL is present on a variety of antigen presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, and macrophages. The 41BB receptor is not detected (<3%) on resting T cells or T cell lines, however, 41BB is stably upregulated when T cells are activated. 41BB activation upregulates survival genes, enhances cell division, induces cytokine production and prevents activation induced cell death in T-cells.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2668156,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Antibodies, also called immunoglobulins, are proteins secreted mainly by plasma cells and are used by immune systems to identify and neutralize pathogens such as bacteria and viruses. Antibodies include IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, wherein IgA, which can be found in breast milk, saliva, tears and bronchial mucus, is very important for mucosal immunity acting as the first line of defense against foreign pathogens. Specifically, many pathogens can infect a host by the contact with mucosal surfaces of the respiratory, intestinal and genitourinary tract, and the secretory antibody IgA, is capable of binding to multiple antigenic determinants (epitope) of pathogens so that the pathogens cannot bind to mucosal cells to infect a host.
      Animal husbandry plays an important role in the agricultural production, wherein the main cause of the poor pig reproduction is related to the high mortality rate in pigs. Generally, it is believed that obligate pathogen is the main cause of diseases in pigs wherein diseases with high mortality rates constitute the majority of pigs diseases. However, according to the result of a serology investigation performed at the graduate institute of veterinary pathobiology at National Chung Hsing University, there is no apparent outbreak of obligate pathogen diseases, e.g., swine fever or pseudorabies in pigs. Some illnesses in pigs caused by infection with single type of pathogen among pathogens with relatively low pathogenicity (e.g., mycoplasma, steurella and salmonella) are not severe. However, if pigs with low immunity are primarily and secondarily infected by a complex of the pathogens with relatively low pathogenicity, the synergistic effects of illnesses would cause the pigs death. Thus, pathogens with low pathogenicity have significant impacts on pig herds with low numbers of pigs.
      Colostrum is a form of milk secreted by female mammals in the first 2-3 days after giving birth, and the milk secreted after the secretion of colostrum are transitional milk and mature milk. Colostrum contains five types of immunoglobulins which are IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, wherein the IgG content is the highest. These immunoglobulins are crucial in defending against viral infection, bacterial infection, parasites and yeasts.
      However, the beneficial ingredients in colostrum are rarely isolated effectively and used except for the lactoferrin, which is purified from colostrum and utilized, and is cultivated in transgenic animals. Moreover, due to the factors such as the short time period of colostrum secretion, the unstable protein in colostrums, and the difficulty of collecting and preserving the colostrums, there are still many difficulties in the practical application of colostrum even though the benefits of colostrums are numerous.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2607366,"BACKGROUND ART
      Cancer is the leading cause of death. Currently conducted therapy comprises mainly surgical therapy in combination with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In spite of the development of new operative procedures and the discovery of new anticancer agents in recent years, cancer treatment results have not been much improved recently, excluding that for some types of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biology or cancer immunology lead to identification of antibodies specifically reacting with cancer, cancer antigens to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells, genes encoding cancer antigens, and the like. Demands on specific cancer therapies targeting cancer antigens are increasing (Non-patent Literature 1).
      In cancer therapy, it is desirable that peptides, polypeptides, or proteins recognized as antigens be almost absent in normal cells, but they be present specifically in cancer cells, in order to alleviate side effects. In 1991, Boon et al., (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Belgium) isolated a human melanoma antigen MAGE1 recognized by CD8-positive T cells by the cDNA expression cloning method using autologous cancer cell lines and cancer-reactive T cells (Non-patent Literature 2). Thereafter, the SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) method that comprises identifying tumor antigens recognized by antibodies that are produced in vivo in response to autologous cancer of a cancer patient by gene expression cloning techniques was reported (Non-patent Literature 3 and Patent Literature 1). With the use of this method, some cancer antigens, which are almost never expressed in normal cells but are specifically expressed in cancer cells, were isolated (Non-patent Literatures 4-9). Furthermore, clinical trials were conducted with cell therapies targeting some cancer antigens using immunocytes specifically reactive with cancer antigens, or cancer-specific immunotherapies using vaccines or the like containing cancer antigens.
      Meanwhile, in recent years, various antibody medicines which target antigenic proteins on cancer cells for cancer treatment have appeared throughout the world. Antibody medicines exhibit some pharmacological effects as cancer specific therapeutic agents and are thus attracting attention. However, most antigen proteins to be targeted are also expressed in normal cells, so that not only cancer cells, but also normal cells expressing antigens are also damaged as a result of antibody administration. The resulting side effects cause for concern. Therefore, it is expected that identification of cancer antigens that are specifically expressed on the surface of a cancer cell and use of antibodies targeting the cancer antigens as pharmaceuticals will realize treatment with antibody medicines with lower side effects.
      Cytoplasmic—and proliferation-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN-1) is expressed when normal cells at the resting phase are activated or undergo cell division, and it is an intracellular protein known to form intracellular stress granules with RNA within cells, so as to be involved in mRNA transport and translational regulation. Meanwhile, many other names that represent CAPRIN-1 exist, such as GPI-anchored membrane protein 1 or membrane component surface marker 1 protein (M11S1), as if such proteins had been known to be cell membrane proteins. These names originated from a report that the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 is a membrane protein having a GPI-binding region and expressed in colorectal cancer cells (Non-patent Literature 10). However, the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 provided in this report was later revealed to be wrong. The following has recently been reported; i.e., deletion of a single nucleotide in the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like causes a frame shift, so that 80 amino acids are lost from the C-terminus, resulting in generation of an artifact (74 amino acids) which corresponds to the GPI-binding portion in the previous report, and additionally, another error is also present 5′ of the gene sequence, so that 53 amino acids were lost from the N-terminus (Non-patent Literature 11). It has been also recently reported that the protein encoded by the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like is not a cell membrane protein (Non-patent Literature 11).
      In addition, on the basis of the report of Non-patent Literature 10 that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein, Patent Literature 2 and 3 describe that CAPRIN-1 (as a cell membrane protein) under the name of M11S1 can be used as a target of an antibody medicine in cancer therapy, although working examples do not describe treatment using an antibody against the protein. However, as reported in Non-patent Literature 11, it has been commonly believed from the time of the filing of Patent Literature 2 to date that CAPRIN-1 is not expressed on the surface of a cell. The contents of Patent Literatures 2 and 3 based only on incorrect information that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein should not clearly be understood as common general knowledge for persons skilled in the art.

      Objects of the present invention are to identify a cancer antigen protein specifically expressed on the surface of a cancer cell and to provide the use of an antibody targeting the cancer antigen protein as an agent for treating and/or preventing a cancer.

      As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have now obtained a cDNA encoding a protein that binds to an antibody existing in sera from dogs with breast cancer by the SEREX method using both cDNA libraries prepared from dog testis tissues and sera of dogs with breast cancer.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2722374,"BACKGROUND
      Coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), also known as antihemophilic factor, plays a critical role in the endogenous coagulation system. Based on a large number of studies of FVIII molecular genetics, the deficiency of FVIII in sex chromosome X-linked genes will lead to type A hemophilia. According to statistics, hemophilia A has a prevalence rate of 1/5000 in the male population, accounting for more than 80% of the total number of hemophilia patients. The current common treatment for hemophilia A is the replacement therapy, that is, to supplement coagulation factor VIII that hemophilia patients lack.
      FVIII is a multi-domain macromolecular glycoprotein, which is divided into six domains: three A domains (A1, A2, A3), one carbohydrate-rich and non-essential central B domain (B), and two C domains (C1, C2). The mature protein consists of a light chain and a heavy chain and has a molecular weight of approximately 280 kDa. The light chain has a molecular weight of about 80 kDa and comprises A3, C1 and C2 domains, with a linking mode of A3-C1-C2. The heavy chain has a molecular weight of about 90 to 200 kDa and comprises A1, A2 and B domains, with a linking mode of A1-A2-B. The association between the heavy chain and light chain is metal ion-dependent. In plasma, the dimer formed by the heavy chain and light chain is protected from premature degradation by binding to von Willebrand factor (vWF) with high affinity. The half-life of non-activated FVIII, bound to vWF in plasma, is about 12 h. FVIII is activated by activated factor FX (FXa) and thrombin through proteolytic cleavage at amino acids Arg 372 and Arg 740 in the heavy chain and at Arg 1689 in the light chain, resulting in the release of vWF factor and the generation of activated FVIII dimer (FVIIIa). In the presence of Ca2+, FVIIIa forms a close complex with activated coagulation factor FIX (FIXa) and FX on the phospholipid surface. FX is then activated by FIXa and the activated FX (FXa) is dissociated from the complex. FXa converts prothrombin to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen directly to fibrin. As a cofactor of the coagulation system, FVIII is able to enhance the efficiency of FIXa to activate FX by several orders of magnitude.
      The FVIII molecule is one of the longest gene fragments cloned to date and is the protein drug with the largest molecular weight used in clinical practice. For recombinant proteins with high molecular weight and high degree glycosylation, mammalian cells are the optimal expression system. However, the in vitro expression yield of recombinant FVIII is significantly lower than those of other genes of similar nature. For example, the expression level of FVIII is only 1% of FIX. The low level expression of FVIII may be a reflection of the body's demand for FVIII, but it is undoubtedly a major obstacle to the in vitro expression of recombinant FVIII. In addition, because the half-life of FVIII in the blood is short, only 8-12 h, severe hemophilia A patients with prophylactic treatment must receive intravenous (i.v.) injection about 3 times a week.
      For prolonging the in vivo functional half-life of FVIII, current techniques are to link FVIII to half-life prolonging moieties such as PEG, human serum albumin (HSA), transferrin, or IgG Fc. For example, pharma companies Novo Nordisk, Bayer, and Baxter have developed long-acting PEGylated FVIII products N8-GP, BAY94-9027, and BAX 855, respectively, which have entered clinical studies. However, the additional step of chemical conjugation of PEG to FVIII in the protein preparation process has reduced the final yield and increased the cost of preparation. Pharmacokinetic data show that PEGylated FVIII does not achieve a significantly longer half-life. For example, N8-GP had a circulation half-life of about 18 h in patients with hemophilia A (Tiede A et al., J Thromb Haemost, 2013, 11:670-678). A clinical phase I study of BAY94-9027 showed that its half-life in healthy humans was about 18.2 h, about 1.4 times longer than that of wild-type FVIII (Coyle T et al., Haemophilia, 2012, 18 (Suppl 3):22). The half-life of Bax 855 was about 18 h (Turecek PL et al., Hamostaseologie, 2012, 32 Suppl 1:S29-38).
      The monomer-dimer hybrid rFVIIIFc fusion protein Eloctate®, developed by Biogen Idec, USA, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in June 2014. Clinical data showed that Eloctate® extended the half-life in humans by 1.5 to 1.7 fold (Dumont J A et al., Blood, 2012, 119:3024-3030; Powell JS et al., Blood, 2012, 119:3031-3037), which needed to be injected once every 3 to 5 days. It was reported that Biogen constructed a double expression vector containing the genes of both rFVIIIFc and Fc. After the vector was transfected into HEK-293 cells, the fusion of rFVIIIFc in homodimer form was not detected in the expressed products as expected, and only the monomer-dimer hybrid rFVIIIFc fusion protein and the Fc dimer were detected. The researchers from the company speculated as follows. As the molecular size of the homodimer form was too large for the expression system, the host cells failed to secrete the rFVIIIFc homodimer protein with a molecular weight of about 400 kDa, or the rFVIIIFc monomer did not aggregate due to the steric hindrance effect (Peters R T et al., J Thromb Haemost, 2013, 11(1):132-141). Therefore, the expression of the homodimer form of the FVIII fusion protein was quite difficult.
      The carboxyl terminal peptide (hereinafter referred to as CTP) of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) beta chain has the effect of prolonging the in vivo half-life of certain proteins. Thus the half-life prolonging moieties can be selected from the immunoglobulin Fc fragment, HSA, CTP, or others as in the fusion proteins disclosed in some patent documents. In addition, CTP can also be used as a linker, mainly used to link different subunits of the same protein. For example, CTP is used as a linker to link the beta and alpha subunits of follicle stimulating hormone, as disclosed in Chinese Patent Nos. CN103539860A, CN103539861A, CN103539868A, and CN103539869A. As another example, CTP is used as a linker to link the beta and alpha subunits of glycoprotein hormone as disclosed in the patent WO2005058953A2.
      The present inventors do not use CTP as a linker or as a half-life prolonging moiety as suggested by the prior art, but instead connect it to a flexible peptide linker (e.g., (GGGGS)n) to constitute a new linker sequence. The new linker is located between FVIII and the half-life prolonging moiety (e.g., the immunoglobulin Fc fragment, which does not contain the CTP as suggested by the prior art) to constitute a new FVIII fusion protein, further prolonging the half-life and maintaining the biological activity and function of FVIII.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention provides a highly glycosylated Fc fusion protein of coagulation factor VIII in homodimer form. The fusion protein has a prolonged in vivo active half-life and similar biological activity to recombinant FVIII. In addition, the present invention provides a method for the efficient and stable expression of the fusion protein. The fusion protein expressed by the method has advantages of high yield, good stability in the preparation and storage processes, and similar biological activity to recombinant FVIII factors on the market.
      The first aspect of the present invention provides a highly glycosylated FVIII fusion protein (hereinafter abbreviated as fusion protein) comprising, sequentially from the N- to C-terminus, human coagulation factor VIII (hFVIII), a flexible peptide linker (L), at least one rigid carboxyl terminal peptide unit of the human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit (hereinafter abbreviated as rigid CTP unit, expressed as (CTP)n, preferably n is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5), and a half-life prolonging moiety (e.g., a immunoglobulin Fc fragment, albumin, transferrin or PEG, preferably a human IgG Fc variant (expressed as vFc)). In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the fusion protein is expressed as hFVIII-L-CTPn-vFc.
      Wherein, the hFVIII is a wild type or a mutant thereof; further, the wild type hFVIII has the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1; preferably, the hFVIII mutant has at least 85% identity to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1; more preferably, the hFVIII mutant has at least 90% identity to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1; and most preferably, the hFVIII mutant has at least 95% identity to the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.
      Wherein, preferably, the flexible peptide linker is non-immunogenic and can generate a sufficient spatial distance between hFVIII and Fc to minimize the steric hindrance between them. Preferably, the flexible peptide linker consists of two or more amino acid residues selected from the following several amino acids: Gly (G), Ser (S), Ala (A) and Thr (T).
      More preferably, the flexible peptide linker comprises G and S residues. The length of the peptide linker is important for the activity of the fusion protein. In the present invention, the peptide linker may preferably comprise a general amino acid sequence formula formed by combining repetitive unit(s), (GS)a(GGS)b(GGGS)c(GGGGS)d, wherein a, b, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 0, and a+b+c+d≥1.
      Specifically, in the embodiments of the present invention, the peptide linker may preferably comprise the following sequences:

      Wherein, the rigid CTP unit is selected from the full length sequence consisting of carboxyl terminal amino acids 113 to 145 of the human chorionic gonadotropin β subunit or a fragment thereof. Specifically, the rigid CTP unit comprises the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 7 or a truncated sequence thereof. First, the CTP peptide that occurs naturally in the human body and contains multiple glycosylation sites is non-immunogenic. Second, compared to the random coil of the flexible peptide linker, the rigid CTP peptide linker containing multiple glycosylation sites can form a stable steric conformation, which allows the FVIII and Fc segments to fold independently into correct three-dimensional conformations without affecting biological activities of each other. Moreover, the glycosyl side chains of CTP has a protective effect which can reduce the sensitivity of the peptide linker to proteases.
      Preferably, the rigid CTP unit contains at least 2 glycosylation sites. For example, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the rigid CTP unit contains 2 glycosylation sites. Illustratively, the rigid CTP unit contains 10 N-terminal amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, i.e. SSSS*KAPPPS*, or the rigid CTP unit contains 14 C-terminal amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, i.e. S*RLPGPS*DTPILPQ. As another example, in another embodiment, the rigid CTP unit contains 3 glycosylation sites. Illustratively, the rigid CTP unit contains 16 N-terminal amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, i.e. SSSS*KAPPPS*LPSPS*R. As yet another example, in other embodiments, the rigid CTP unit contains 4 glycosylation sites. Illustratively, the rigid CTP unit contains 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33 amino acids, starting from position 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, or 118 and ending at position 145 of the human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit. Specifically, the rigid CTP unit contains 28 N-terminal amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 7, i.e. SSSS*KAPPPS*LPSPS*RLPGPS*DTPILPQ. In this context, * represents a glycosylation site. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention.
      In other embodiments, the rigid CTP units provided by the present invention have at least 70% identity to the native CTP amino acid sequence. In other embodiments, the rigid CTP units provided by the present invention have at least 80% identity to the native CTP amino acid sequence. In other embodiments, the rigid CTP units provided by the present invention have at least 90% identity to the native CTP amino acid sequence. In other embodiments, the rigid CTP units provided by the present invention have at least 95% identity to the native CTP amino acid sequence.
      Preferably, the rigid CTP units described in the specific embodiments of the present invention may comprise the following sequences:

      In some embodiments of the present invention, the fusion protein comprises one of the rigid CTP units described above.
      In other embodiments of the present invention, the fusion protein contains more than one of the rigid CTP units described above, preferably contains 2, 3, 4 or 5 rigid CTP units described above. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, the fusion protein contains two rigid CTP3 units: SSSSKAPPPSSSSSKAPPPS (CTP3-CTP3, or expressed as (CTP3)2).
      Wherein, preferably, the half-life prolonging moiety is selected from an Fc fragment of immunoglobulin IgG, IgM, or IgA, and more preferably from an Fc fragment of human IgGI, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 and variants thereof. Further, the human IgG Fc variants contain at least one amino acid modification relative to the wild type human IgG Fc, and have reduced effector functions (ADCC and/or CDC effects) and/or an enhanced binding affinity for the neonatal receptor FcRn. Further, the human IgG Fc variants may be selected from the following group:
      (i) vFcγl: human IgG1 hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions containing Leu234Val, Leu235Ala and Pro331Ser mutations, and having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 11;
      (ii) vFcγ2-1: human IgG2 hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions containing Pro331Ser mutation, and having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12;
      (iii) vFcγ2-2: human IgG2 hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions containing Thr250Gln and Met428Leu mutations, and having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 13;
      (iv) vFcγ2-3: human IgG2 hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions containing Pro331Ser, Thr250Gln and Met428Leu mutations, and having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 14;
      (v) vFcγ4: human IgG4 hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions containing Ser228Pro and Leu235Ala mutations, and having the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 15.
      The IgG Fc variants provided by the present invention include, but are not limited to, the five variants described in (i) to (v), and may also be those obtained by combining or adding the mutation sites of two functional variants of the same IgG subtype. For example, the variant described in (iv) above is a new IgG2 Fc combination variant obtained by adding the mutation sites in (ii) and (iii).
      The Fc variants (vFcs) in the fusion proteins of the present invention contain the hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions of human IgG, e.g., human IgG1, IgG2 and IgG4. The CH2 region contains amino acid mutations at positions 228, 234, 235 and 331, defined by the EU numbering system, and it is believed that these amino acid mutations can reduce the effector functions mediated by the Fc region. Human IgG2 does not bind to FcγRs and exhibits very weak complement activity. The Fcγ2 variants with Pro331Ser mutation have lower complement activity than native Fcγ2 and are still non-binders to FcγRs. IgG4 Fc is deficient in activating the complement cascade and its binding affinity for FcγRs is about an order of magnitude lower than that of IgGI Fc. The Fcγ4 variants with Leu235Ala mutation exhibit minimum effector functions as compared to native Fcγ4. The Fcγ1 variants with Leu234Val, Leu235Ala and Pro331Ser mutations also exhibit reduced effector functions as compared to native Fcγ1. The above Fc variants are more suitable for the preparation of FVIII fusion proteins than native human IgG Fcs. The amino acid mutations at 250 and 428 positions, defined by the EU numbering system, increase the binding affinity of the Fc region for the neonatal receptor FcRn, thereby further prolonging the half-life (Paul R et al., J Biol Chem, 2004, 279:6213-6216). The above two types of functional variants are combined or added on each other to generate new combination variants to reduce the effector functions while prolonging the half-life. The Fc variants of the present invention contain mutations that are not limited to the above-described sites, but may also introduce substitutions at other sites such that Fcs have reduced effector functions and/or enhanced binding to FcRn. Meantime, these mutations do not lead to reduction of the function/activity of the Fc variants or undesirable conformational changes. Common mutation sites may be found in Shields R L et al., J Biol Chem, 2001,276(9):6591-604.
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the amino acid sequence of the fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO: 16.
      The second aspect of the present invention provides a DNA molecule encoding any one of the above-described fusion proteins.
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the DNA sequence of the fusion protein is shown in SEQ ID NO: 17.
      Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a vector containing the DNA molecule described above.
      Yet another aspect of the present invention provides a host cell containing or transfected with the above-described vector.
      In a particular embodiment of the invention, the host cell is a CHO-derived cell strain DG44.
      The fifth aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient and/or diluent, and an effective amount of the above-described fusion protein.
      Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for preparing or producing the fusion protein from a mammalian cell line, e.g., a CHO-derived cell line, which comprises the steps of:
      (a) introducing the DNA molecule encoding the fusion protein into a mammalian cell line to produce a CHO-derived cell line;
      (b) screening the cell strains of step (a) to obtain a high-yield cell strain expressing more than 1 IU/106 cells per 24 h in its growth medium;
      (c) culturing the cell strain obtained in step (b) to express the fusion protein;
      (d) harvesting the fermentation broth of step (c) and isolating and purifying the fusion protein.
      Further, the CHO-derived cell line in step (a) is DG44.
      Further, the cell cultivation in step (c) may be carried out by using a batch, perfusion or fed-batch culture method.
      Further, in step (d), the fusion protein is purified by a four-step chromatography procedure, i.e., affinity chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, and molecular sieve chromatography. The present invention further gives the preferred purification conditions in Example 5.
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fusion protein prepared by the above method has an activity of >6000 IU/mg.
      The sixth aspect of the present invention provides use of the fusion protein in the manufacture of a drug for the prevention or treatment of a hemorrhagic disease or event resulting from a deficiency or functional defect of FVIII.
      Further, the disease includes type A hemophilia. The fusion proteins of the present invention play a role in controlling or preventing the occurrence of bleeding in spontaneous bleeding events, surgical prophylaxis, perioperative period management, or surgical treatment in hemophilia A patients.
      The present inventors have found that the advantages of both the fusion proteins and their preparation methods described and/or disclosed in the present invention can be summarized as follows:
      1. The FVIII fusion protein constructed by the present invention is non-lytic, that is, by mutating the complement and receptor binding region of the Fc segment and adjusting the binding affinity of Fc for the corresponding receptor, the ADCC and CDC effects are reduced or eliminated, while only the role of the Fc segment for prolonging the in vivo half-life of the active protein is kept without the generation of cytotoxicity. The Fc segment of the FVIII fusion protein developed by Biogen is from a natural source. It is predictable that the Fc-mediated adverse effector functions will increase treatment risks to patients.
      2. The present invention adopts CHO cells for expressing the fusion proteins. Only the homodimeric FVIII Fc fusion protein exists in the expression products, and the purification step is simple and efficient. For expressing the monomer-dimer hybrid (Monomeric) FVIII fusion protein, Biogen constructed a double expression vector that expressed both rFVIIIFc and Fc, which was to be transfected into HEK-293 cells (U.S. Publication No. US20130274194A1). Three forms of protein expression products were expected to be in the fermentation broth, the FVIII-Fc:FVIII-Fc homodimeric (Dimeric) fusion protein, the FVIII-Fc:Fc monomer-dimer hybrid (Monomeric) fusion protein, and the Fc:Fc dimer. During the fusion protein expression process, the host cells needed to express both FVIII-Fc and Fc single chain molecules simultaneously, and then the molecules bound to each other to form the above three products, such that the final expression efficiency of the target product was greatly reduced. In addition, in the purification process, the other two forms of side products had also to be removed. Hence, the purification process was more complex and the production efficiency was lower, such that the production cost was greatly increased. Compared to that of the Monomeric rFVIIIFc fusion protein developed by Biogen, the preparation method of the present invention has certain technical and price advantages. The expression and purification process of the present invention is simpler and more efficient and the production cost is lower.
      3. HemA mice were given the FVIII fusion protein FP-B of the present invention at doses of 30 IU/kg, 90 IU/kg and 270 IU/kg, respectively. In the middle and high dose groups, acute hemorrhage in the HemA mice could be effectively controlled, and the mouse survival rate of groups given each dose of FP-B were higher than the group given recombinant FVIII, Xyntha (Pfizer), indicating that the fusion protein FP-B had a more lasting pharmacodynamic effect than Xyntha. Meantime, both of bleeding time and volume results in the high and low FP-B dose groups showed dose-dependent relations.
      4. Compared to the recombinant FVIII, Xyntha, the fusion protein of the present invention may be expected to have reduced immunogenicity and reduced production of neutralizing antibodies in patients.
      5. The fusion proteins provided by the present invention have high biological activities. The activity of each batch of purified fusion proteins is in the range of 6000-10000 IU/mg. When expressed in molar specific activity, it is about 2340-3900 IU/nM fusion protein, corresponding to 1170-1950 IU/nM FVIII, as each fusion protein molecule contains two FVIII molecules. In some batches, the activity of the purified fusion protein is even more than 12000 IU/mg, expressed in molar specific activity as about 4680 IU/nM fusion protein, corresponding to 2340 IU/nM FVIII. Thus, the activity of the fusion protein provided by the present invention is comparable to or even higher than that of the monomer-dimer hybrid rFVIIIFc fusion protein (1660-1770 IU/nM), developed by Biogen (J. McCue et al., Biologicals, 2015,43:213-219), and that of recombinant FVIII ReFacto (1521-2287 IU/nM) on the market (U.S. Publication No. US20130274194A1). This indicates that the Fc segment fused to the C-terminus of the fusion protein of the present invention has little effect on the activity of FVIII.
      6. The fusion protein provided by the present invention contains a rigid CTP polypeptide with multiple glycosyl side chains, which can form a stable steric conformation compared to the random coil of a flexible linker such as (GGGGS)n. This “separation” effect causes the FVIII and Fc segments to fold independently into correct three-dimensional conformations without affecting biological activities of each other. CTP possesses glycosyl groups. Highly sialylated, negatively charged CTP can resist the clearance by the kidney, further prolonging the half-life of the fusion protein. Moreover, the protective effect of side chains of CTP can reduce the sensitivity of the peptide linker to proteases, such that the fusion protein is not easily degraded in the linking region.
      7. The fusion protein of the invention has good stability in the processes of fermentation, purification and storage.
      8. The preparation method of the fusion protein provided by the invention has the advantage of high yield. After cells are cultured in a 300 mL shake flask for 14 days, the cumulative yield can reach at least 150 mg/L, which can be scaled up to realize large-scale industrial production.
      It should be understood that within the scope of the present invention, the above-described technical characteristics of the present invention and those described specifically in the followings (e.g., examples) may be combined with each other to produce a new or preferred technical solution.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2760334,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia are one of the largest societal challenges today. The World Health Organization estimates that costs for care of the elderly will continue to increase and that the number of diagnosed dementia cases will triple by 2050 (World Health Organization and Alzheimer's Disease International—Status Report (2012) DEMENTIA: A public health priority, WHO). The first treatments for AD were neurotransmitter modulators such as acetylcholine esterase inhibitors and NMDA modulators. These therapies became available at the turn of the millennium and still form the cornerstone for symptomatic relief of memory deficits related to dementia and AD. However, these drugs do not target the underlying causes of AD, accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and tau protein aggregates and associated loss of neuronal synapses and eventually neurons.
      Longitudinal, community-wide studies of the elderly (Weiner, M. W. et al. (2014) ADNI; Breteler, M. M. et al. (1992) Neuroepidemiology 11 Suppl 1, 23-28; Launer, L. J. (1992) Neuroepidemiology 11 Suppl 1, 2-13) together with large genome-wide association studies (Lambert, J. C. et al. (2013) Nat. Genet. 45, 1452-1458) have shown that AD is a heterogeneous mix of dementias where up to 10 percent of the advanced AD patients lack amyloid pathology (Crary, J. F. et al. (2014) Acta Neuropathol. 128, 755-766). Furthermore, seminal pathological studies by Braak & Braak (Braak, H. and Braak, E. (1996) Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl 165, 3-12) demonstrated a clear correlation between the degree of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and cognitive state prior to autopsy. These observations have been reinforced by several investigators (Nelson, P. T. et al. (2012) J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 71, 362-381), and in recent longitudinal biomarker studies, which indicate that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau and phospho-tau increase throughout early and late stages of the disease (Jack, C. R., Jr. et al. (2013) Lancet Neurol. 12, 207-216).
      As indicated above, the microtubule-associated protein, tau, and its hyper-phosphorylated version, form the main constituent of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles, which are one of the main hallmarks of AD. Furthermore, specific genetic variants of tau are associated with familial forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Appearance of tau pathology in AD occurs in a distinct spatial pattern, starting in the entorhinal cortex, followed by hippocampal and cortical areas (Braak, H. and Braak, E. (1996) Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl 165, 3-12). The specific stage of tau pathology also correlates well with cognitive abilities (Nelson, P. T. et al. (2012) J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 71, 362-381; Braak, E. et al. (1999) Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 249 Suppl 3, 14-22). Taken together, this evidence forms the basis of a tau-based hypothesis for AD. It entails that the intracellular accumulation of tau leads to microtubule degeneration and spinal collapse. As a result, communication between neurons malfunctions and cell death follows. Recently, it has also been shown that tau itself may form an endo-pathogenic species that can transmit neurodegeneration from one cell to the next (Clavaguera, F. et al. (2009) Nat. Cell Biol. 11, 909-913).
Tau as an Endo-Pathogen
      Clavaguera and colleagues have demonstrated that tau itself may act as an endo-pathogen (Clavaguera, F. et al. (2009) Nat. Cell Biol. 11, 909-913). Low spin brain extracts were isolated from P301S tau transgenic mice (Allen, B. et al. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22, 9340-9351), diluted and injected into the hippocampus and cortical areas of young ALZ17 mice. The ALZ17 mouse is a tau transgenic mouse line which only develops late pathology (Probst, A. et al. (2000) Acta Neuropathol. 99, 469-481). The injected ALZ17 mice quickly developed solid filamentous pathology, and administration of immuno-depleted brain extracts from P301S mice or extracts from wild type mice did not induce tau pathology. Fractionation of the brain extracts in soluble (S1) and sarcosyl-insoluble tau (P3) (Sahara, N. et al. (2013) J. Alzheimer's. Dis. 33, 249-263) and injection of these into ALZ17 mice demonstrated that the P3 fraction is most competent in inducing pathology. It contains most of the intracellular hyper-phosphorylated filamentous tau. The majority of pathology could also be induced when injecting P301S extracts into the brains of wild type mice, but no NFTs were formed. In subsequent studies, Clavaguera et al. have shown that human tau extracted from post-mortem brain tissue of other tauopathies (Argyrophilic Grain Disease (AGD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD)) may also induce tau pathology in the ALZ17 model (Clavaguera, F. et al. (2013) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 9535-9540). Since the presentation of these data, several other tau seeding and spreading models have been reported (Ahmed, Z. et al. (2014) Acta Neuropathol. 127, 667-683; Walker, L. C. et al. (2013) JAMA Neurol. 70, 304-310). The main conclusion from these studies indicates a mechanism by which pathogenic tau in intracellular inclusions is secreted from the cell into the periplasmic space. The pathological tau material is then transported along the vesicular sheath in both anterograde and retrograde direction and subsequently taken up by neighboring cells by means of bulk endocytosis. This mechanism explains why the spread of pathology observed in human disease follows a distinct anatomical pattern. Intriguingly, peripheral administration of pathological tau may accelerate the formation of tau pathology in ALZ17 mice (Clavaguera, F. et al. (2014) Acta Neuropathol. 127, 299-301).
Relation Between Alpha-Synuclein and Tau Pathology
      Alpha-synuclein is a member of a family of proteins including beta- and gamma-synuclein and synoretin. Alpha-synuclein is expressed in the normal state associated with synapses and is believed to play a role in regulating synaptic vesicle release and thereby affect neural plasticity, learning and memory.
      Several studies have implicated alpha-synuclein with a central role in Parkinson's Disease (PD) pathogenesis. The protein can aggregate to form intracellular insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions. For example, synuclein accumulates in Lewy Bodies (LB) (Spillantini et al., Nature (1997) 388:839-40; Takeda et al., J. Pathol. (1998) 152:367-72; Wakabayashi et al., Neurosci. Lett. (1997) 239:45-8). Mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene as well as duplications and triplications of the gene co-segregate with rare familial forms of parkinsonism (Kruger et al., Nature Gen. (1998) 18:106-8; Polymeropoulos, et al., Science (1997) 276:2045-7).
      An important finding has been that alpha-synuclein can be secreted into and be present in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Several studies, for example by Pacheco et al. (2015) and others (Conway et al., (2000) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 97:571-576; Volles et al., J. Biochem. (2003) 42:7871-7878) have suggested that extracellular-synuclein plays a pathogenic role in the brain. They demonstrated that alpha-synuclein possesses neurotoxicity toward brain neuronal plasma membranes exposed directly to extracellular-synuclein oligomers. Another intriguing hypothesis based on the data of synuclein secretion is that a prion-like spread of alpha-synuclein underlies the progression of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies (Lee et al., Hansen et al. (2011) J. Clin Invest 121:715-725). These finding have given rise to a hope that extracellular-synuclein could be targeted by immunotherapy (Vekrellis et al. (2011) Lancet Neurol 10:1015-1025) and be a potential treatment of alpha-synucleinopathies. In addition to mutations, alternative splicing of the alpha-synuclein gene and posttranslational modifications of the protein, such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, nitration, and truncation can create alpha-synuclein protein forms that have enhanced capacity to form aggregated and/or toxic forms of alpha-synuclein (Beyer and Ariza, Mol Neurobiol. 2013 April; 47(2):509-24). However, the precise pathological species of alpha-synuclein in alpha-synucleinopathies remains unknown. Various misfolded/aggregated/secreted species ranging from oligomers to fibrils, and different post-translational modifications have been associated with toxicity but there is no consensus on which is most important, if indeed there even is a single toxic species.
      The co-appearance of pathologies, for example Lewy bodies, Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in subsets of patients with PD or Lewy bodies in a subset of AD patients (Galpern and Lang, Ann. Neurol. (2008), 59: 449-458) has led to investigations of to what extent aggregation prone proteins can cross-seed each other. Alpha-synuclein and tau proteins have been reported to be able to induce fibrillization of each upon co-incubation in vitro (Giasson et al., (2003) Science 300: 636-640). In cellular systems there is both evidence supporting and not supporting a cross-seeding of tau with alpha-synuclein fibrils. Holmes et al., could not demonstrate a cross-seeding of tau with fibrils made from full-length alpha-synuclein in a FRET based tau reporter cell line (Holmes et al., (2014) PNAS doi/10.1073: E4376-E4385). Nor could Tau aggregation be induced with fibrillated full-length alpha-synuclein A53T or a PTA-precipitated (to enrich for fibrillated alpha-synuclein) brain sample from a multiple system atrophy (MSA) patient (Woerman et al., (2015) PNAS doi/10.1073: E4949-E4958. Others have reported that under some conditions alpha-synuclein can induce tau aggregation, for example alpha-synuclein fibrils made from N-terminal truncated (21-140) alpha-synuclein was shown to induce tau phosphorylation in QBI293 cells (Waxman and Giasson (2011) J. Neurosci 31: 7604-7618). In neuronal cultures full length fibrillated alpha-synuclein do seed tau aggregation. However fibrillated alpha-synuclein made from truncated alpha-synuclein (1-120 or 32-140) can through repeated self-seeding in cells (5 or 10% of fibrillated alpha-synuclein from each passage included as seeds in the fibrilization of the subsequent passage) (Guo et al., (2013) Cell 154: 109-117).
      To our knowledge no studies has hypothesised that secreted oligomeric or fibrillated forms of alpha-synuclein could be a contributing factor in the early pathogenesis of AD or other tauophaties in general independent of visible alpha-synuclein inclusions. The reports that could demonstrate a cross-seeding of tau with alpha-synuclein have focussed on explaining why there in some PD patients, with manifest alpha-synuclein aggregation (Lewy bodies) are found neurofibrillary tangles. These studies speculate that the cross-seeding can take place in areas where there is a close physiological association of tau and alpha-synuclein deposits (Giasson et al., (2003) Science 300: 636-640; Waxman and Giasson (2011) J. Neurosci 31: 7604-7618; Guo et al., (2013) Cell 154: 109-117). The idea that soluble extracellular oligomeric/fibrillated forms of alpha-synuclein and not intracellular aggregates in the form of Lewy bodies or Lewy neurites are the important contributing factor in the generation of tau neurofibrillar tangles is new.
Alpha-Synuclein Immunotherapies
      Antibodies binding to alpha-synuclein have been developed as potential therapeutic agents to treat synucleinopathies, also known as Lewy body diseases (LBDs). Synucleinopathies are characterized by deposition of intracellular protein aggregates microscopically visible as Lewy bodies (LBs) and/or Lewy neurites, where the protein alpha-synuclein is a major component (Jellinger, Mov Disord. 2012 January; 27(1):8-30; McKeith et al., Neurology (1996) 47:1113-24). Synucleinopathies include Parkinson's disease (including idiopathic Parkinson's disease) and Diffuse Lewy Body (DLB) disease (also known as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Lewy body variant of Alzheimer's disease (LBV), Combined Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease (PD), pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy (MSA; e.g., Olivoponto-cerebellar Atrophy, Striatonigral Degeneration and Shy-Drager Syndrome).
      Several different antibodies to alpha-synuclein have been shown to have therapeutic effect in preclinical animal models. Both an antibody targeting an epitope involving alpha-synuclein residues 91-99 and antibodies targeting an epitope that involves alpha-synuclein residues 118-126 have been shown to have an effect on motor and cognitive deficits in transgenic mice (Games et al. 2014). The most advanced of these antibodies is a humanized antibody based on the mouse monoclonal antibody 9E4, which targets an epitope that involves alpha-synuclein residues 118-126, and which is now in clinical trials in phase I. Also an antibody that targets an amino-terminal epitope of alpha-synuclein has been shown to have possible therapeutic potential in preventing spreading and toxicity of pathology in a mouse prion like transfer model (Tran et al. 2014) and a C-terminal antibody 274 which targets an epitope that involves alpha-synuclein residues 120-140 (Bae et al. 2012) was also shown to have an effect in preclinical model on spreading of the pathology from cell to cell. In addition to these, antibodies targeting conformational species such as oligomers and fibrils of alpha-synuclein have been shown to be able to at least reduce the levels of these presumably toxic alpha-synuclein species (Lindtsröm et al. 2014 and Spencer et al. 2014). These conformational antibodies that lower alpha-synuclein oligomer levels in vivo, such as mab47 were also shown to target epitopes in the C-terminus of alpha-synuclein, from amino acid 121-125 (US20120308572). Other conformational, fibril and oligomer specific antibodies also target C-terminal sequences (Vaikath et al. Neurobiol Dis. 2015 Apr. 30; 79:81-99). Importantly none of these alpha-synuclein antibodies has been claimed to be able to prevent tau aggregation and as a consequence be able to potentially treat tauopathies.
      In this invention we surprisingly discovered that aggregated/fibrillated alpha-synuclein can induce aggregation of Tau and that several antibodies generated to bind alpha-synuclein are able to prevent this aggregation. We show that a panel of different alpha-synuclein antibodies are all able to prevent aggregation of Tau in the cellular model: An antibody (GM37) that can bind to the presumed toxic alpha-synuclein fragment 1-119/122 (binding to amino acids 112-117 of alpha-synuclein) and neutralize this truncated form of alpha-synuclein, an antibody (2E6) that bind to amino acid 136-140 of alpha-synuclein, an antibody (GM63) that bind to amino acid 126-138 of alpha-synuclein and an antibody 9E4 that bind to amino acid 118-126 of alpha-synuclein. To support that fibrillary forms of alpha-synuclein may contribute to early AD pathology we demonstrate the presence of fibrillated alpha-synuclein in brains from AD patients independent of the presence of Lewy body pathology. This supports that soluble extracellular forms of fibrillated alpha-synuclein can potentially play a role in contributing to Tau-pathology in tauopathies such as all AD patients and not only in those characterised with visible alpha-synuclein aggregates (determined by brain imaging or post mortem staining).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES
"
2528408,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Protein kinases are the enzymes which transfer a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate to certain serine, threonine or tyrosine residues. Protein phosphorylation causes the activation of signal transduction pathways, which play crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell growth, metabolism, differentiation and death. It is known that abnormal signals caused by abnormal or improper activities of protein kinases are related to a number of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, autoimmune disease, metabolic disease, infection, central nervous system disease, cardiovascular disease and so on. Thus, protein kinases are attractive targets for drug development (Cohen, Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery 2002, 1, 309).
      The abl gene and the bcr gene are normal genes located on chromosome 9 and 22, respectively. Two fusion genes are created by the reciprocal translocation between these two genes: the bcr-abl gene located on chromosome 22q- and the abl-bcr gene located on chromosome 9q+. The protein of 210 kD (p210Bcr-Abl) is encoded by the bcr-abl gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. The Abl part of the Bcr-Abl protein comprising the Abl tyrosine kinase is strictly regulated in the prototype c-Abl but continuously activated in the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, which results in cell growth disorder. The Bcr-Abl protein can be found in 95% of the patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and in 10-25% of the patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Imatinib, brand-named as Gleevec, is a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has been clinically proven to be an effective formulation for the treatment of CML. (Druker et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006, 355, 2408). However, despite continuous treatment using Imatinib, some patients with CMLs are recurrent at the terminal phase or the blast crisis phase due to drug resistance. The molecular basis of drug resistance is that imatinib-resistant mutants arise in the kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl protein. To date, more than 22 mutants have been reported and the most common ones are M244V, G250E, Q252H, Y253H, E255K, E255V, F311L, T351I, F317L, F359V, V379I, L387M, H396P, H396R and etc. (Nardi, et al. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2004, 11, 35).
      c-Kit (CD117, stem cell factor receptor), encoded by the c-kit proto-oncogene, is a kind of growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. It can be activated upon binding to stem cell factor (SCF). Mutations in c-kit result in continuous activation of the function of c-Kit tyrosine kinase, which further causes the activity of tyrosine kinase independent on ligands, the autophosphorylation of c-Kit, and the deregulation of cell proliferation. Overexpression and mutations of c-Kit are found in most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are a series of mesenchymal tumors which arise from the precursors of gastrointestinal tract tissue cells. They mainly occur in the middle-aged and the old population. About 70% of the tumors occur in the stomach, 20-30% of the tumors occur in the small intestine and less than 10% of the tumors occur in the esophagus, colon and rectum. As known to all, gastrointestinal stromal tumors are resistant to classical chemotherapy but can be treated effectively by inhibiting c-Kit using Imatinib, which suggests that c-Kit plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Joensuu et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001, 344, 1052). c-Kit is overexpressed and mutates in other various human cancers as well, including mast cell tumor, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumor, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, oophoroma and acute myeloid leukaemia (see Edling et al. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007, 39, 1995; Lennartsson et al. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets, 2006, 6, 65).
      In addition to the role in cancers, SCF/c-Kit also related to autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. SCF is expressed by various structural and inflammatory cells in the breathing passage. A number of pathways are activated by the combination of SCF and c-Kit, including the pathways involving Phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase, phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma, Src protein kinase, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Suppression of the SCF/c-Kit pathway can dramatically lower the level of histamine, reduce the penetration of mast cells and eosinophilic granulocytes, and decrease the release of interleukin (IL)-4 and the over-reactivity of the breathing passages. SCF/c-Kit is therefore a potential treatment target, which can control the number of mast cells and eosinophilic granulocytes, and can control the activation of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, including scytitis, rheumatoid arthritis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and Crohn disease (see Reber et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006, 533, 327; Paniagua et al. Nat. Clin. Prac. Rheum. 2007, 3, 190).
      Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), such as PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β, are transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, whose ligands are formed by two A chains (PDGF-A), or two B chains (PDGF-B), or a heterodimer of one A chain and one B chain (PDGF-AB). Platelet-derived growth factor receptors are dimerized upon ligands binding, followed by activation of its tyrosine kinase and signaling to downstream. In vivo animal studies on PDGFs and PDGFRs reveal that PDGFR-α signaling plays a role in the development of gastrulation, cranial and cardiac neural crest, gonad, lung, intestine, skin, central nervous system and bone. Similarly, the role of PDGFR-β signaling in angiogenesis and early hematopoiesis has been revealed as well. Platelet-derived growth factor signaling is associated with a number of diseases. Autocrine activation of growth factor signaling pathway relates to some gliomatosis cerebri, myeloproliferative disease, tumor, multiple myeloma, and sarcoma including dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Paracrine growth factor signaling is usually found in epithelial cancer. It initiates the inhalation of matrix therein, and may participate in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and thus affect tumor's development, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Platelet-derived growth factors drive organic pathological changes of vascular disease, such as atheromatosis, arteriostenosis, pulmonary hypertension, retinal disease, and hepatofibrosis including pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, hepatocirrhosis, scleriasis, glomerulosclerosis and myocardial fibrosis (see Andrae et al. Gene Dev. 2008, 22, 1276). Therefore, the suppression of PDGFR can prevent and treat the above-mentioned diseases. Additionally, the suppression of PDGFR can also treat a variety of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases including diabetes, particularly Type-I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn disease and etc (Paniagua et al. Nat. Clin. Prac. Rheum. 2007, 3, 190; Louvet et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2008, 105, 18895).
      The invention provides a novel kind of dihydroindene amide derivatives, which can inhibit the activity of protein kinases, especially one or more protein kinases described above. These compounds will therefore be useful to prevent or treat the diseases associated with the abnormality or disorder in the activity of protein kinases, especially the diseases associated with abnormality in the activity of Abl, Bcr-Abl, c-Kit and PDGFR protein kinases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2609633,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The efficient removal of impurities during affinity chromatography, including host cell proteins (HCPs) and product-related impurities, such as high (HMWs) and low (LMWs) molecular weight species, is a crucial factor during downstream processing of proteins. The purity of the protein after the first purification step (the “capture step”), notably influences the type and number of subsequent steps required to generate a purified product. The capture step is also critical because it concentrates the product, which allows for the use of proportionally smaller, less costly columns in subsequent purification steps. Therefore, it is important to optimize the removal of impurities during the first chromatography step. In the case of antibody purification, this first step is typically based on affinity to protein A or derivatives.
      Low pH conditions (e.g., between pH 3-4) are required to elute bound target protein from the affinity column, but have the disadvantage of potentially inducing aggregation. Historically, less stringent conditions, such as a pH between 5-5.5 have been used to wash non-specifically bound impurities from the column, while simultaneously preserving the target-protein A interaction. The recovery, however, is often decreased due to partial elution of the target protein under these conditions, particularly when working at high loading densities.
      The amino acid arginine has been shown to solubilize certain precipitated proteins (M, Tsumoto K, Nitta S, Adschiri T, Ejima D, Arakawa T, and Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 328, 189-197 (2005); Umetsu M, Tsumoto K, Hara M, Ashish K, Goda S, Adschiri T, Kumagai I. J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar. 14; 278(11):8979-87), reduce the formation of aggregates (Arakawa T, Tsumoto K. Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Apr. 25; 304(1):148-52) and Arakawa T, Biophys. Chem. 127 (2007), pp. 1-8 (Review)) and reduce nonspecific adsorption of proteins to surfaces (Ejima D, J Chromato A, 05 and Schneider C P, J. Phys. Chem. B 113 (2009), pp. 2050-2058). Moreover, in contrast to guanidium hydrochloride, arginine has not been shown not to unfold proteins (Arakawa T, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 304 (2003), pp. 148-152 and Nakakido M, Biophys. Chem. 137 (2008), pp. 105-109).
      As such, arginine has been used to elute proteins from affinity chromatography columns and other types of purification columns. For example, Arakawa et al. describe methods of eluting antibodies from a Protein A column using an elution buffer containing 0.5-2.0 M arginine at pH 4.1-5.0 (Arakawa et al. (2004) Protein Expression and Purification 36:244-248; Tsumoto, K. et al. (2004) Biotechnol. Prog. 20:1301-1308; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050176109). Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 7,501,495 by Ejima et al. describes methods of eluting proteins from a gel filtration column by a developing solution containing arginine hydrochloride. Ghose et al. describe methods of eluting proteins of interest from underivatized silica using an arginine gradient as the eluant (Ghose, S. et al. (2004) Biotech. Bioeng. 87:413-423). U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030050450 by Coffman et al. describes methods of dissociating Fc containing molecules from complexes of the Fc containing molecule and Protein A, wherein the Fc/Protein A complexes are applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (HIC) and the column is washed with a buffer containing arginine.
      Barron et al. describe an intermediate wash solution for Protein A chromatography containing 0.5 to 2.0 M arginine in a phosphate/acetate buffer at pH 5.0-7.5 (optimally 1M arginine, 0.1M phosphate/acetate buffer at pH 5.0). This arginine wash step is reported to remove HCP contaminants. The authors also tested an intermediate wash solution that contained sodium chloride at 0.5-2.0 M at pH 5.0-7.5, and reported that the NaCl wash showed no significant decrease in HCP (Barron et al., “Improving Purity on Protein A Affinity Media Through Use of an Arginine Intermediate Wash Step”, http://www.priorartdatabase.com/IPCOM/000127319). Moreover, Barron et al. reported that lowering the pH of the wash buffer had a beneficial effect under the conditions used in the experiment.
      There is a longstanding need for improved techniques to enhance the purification process and increase product recovery. The present disclosure addresses this need and provides additional benefits.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      This invention provides an efficient and robust wash solution for affinity chromatography, as well as washing methods using this solution. This wash solution is applied in a washing step prior to the elution step, and its use effectively removes low molecular weight species (LMWs), high molecular weight species (HMWs), and host cell proteins (HCPs) from the starting material applied to the matrix, while resulting in high yields of the protein of interest eluted from the affinity matrix. This wash solution is characterized by the presence of arginine at high pH, i.e., above 8.0, without the presence of a nonbuffering salt. This combination of arginine (or an arginine derivative) at high pH removes significantly more impurities than wash solutions containing arginine at lower pH and results in a sharper elution peak correlating with a high concentration of the recovered protein of interest.
      Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method of producing a purified protein of interest (e.g., an antibody, antibody fragment, or protein) using an affinity chromatography (AC) matrix to which the protein of interest is bound, the method comprising washing the AC matrix with a wash solution comprising arginine, or an arginine derivative, at a pH of greater than 8.0, without the presence of a nonbuffering salt. In a preferred embodiment, the pH of the wash solution is at least 8.1, more preferably at least 8.5, and even more preferably at least 8.9 or 9.0. In one embodiment, the pH of the wash solution is about 8.5-9.5. In another embodiment, the pH of the wash solution is about 8.9-9.0.
      In another embodiment, the method further comprises (a) loading a mixture comprising the protein of interest onto the AC matrix, (b) washing the AC matrix with a wash solution comprising arginine, or an arginine derivative, at a pH greater than 8.0; and (c) eluting the protein of interest from the AC matrix, wherein the wash is performed without the presence of a nonbuffering salt.
      In a particular embodiment, the AC matrix is a Protein A column. In various other embodiments, the AC matrix is selected from the group consisting of a Protein G column, a Protein AIG column, a Protein L column, an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column, a calmodulin resin column, a MEP HyperCel™ column, a column that binds maltose binding protein (MBP), a column that binds glutathione-S-transferase (GST), a column that binds Strep-Tag II, and a dye-affinity column. In other embodiments, the AC matrix comprises a resin selected from the group consisting of CaptureSelect IgG-CH1, CaptureSelect IgG-Fc (Hu), CaptureSelect LC-kappa (Hu), CaptureSelect LC-lambda (Hu), CaptureSelect IgG4 (Hu), CaptureSelect IgG1 (Hu), CaptureSelect IgG3 (Hu), CaptureSelect IgM and CaptureSelect IgA. In other embodiments, the AC matrix comprises a resin selected from the group consisting of IgSelect, KappaSelect, LamdaFabSelect, and Capto L.
      Suitable proteins of interest include, but are not limited to, antibodies (and other proteins comprising Fc regions, such as Fc fusion proteins) and antibody fragments, although other proteins that bind to the affinity matrices described herein are also suitable for purification according to the methods of the invention.
      In another aspect, the invention provides a method of producing a purified antibody, antibody fragment, or protein comprising an Fc region (e.g., an Fc fusion protein), using a Protein A column, the method comprising (a) loading a mixture comprising the antibody, antibody fragment, or protein, onto the Protein A column; (b) washing the Protein A column with a wash solution comprising (i) arginine, or an arginine derivative, at a pH of greater than 8.0 (e.g., about 8.5-9.5 or about 8.9-9.0); and (c) eluting the antibody, antibody fragment, or protein, from the Protein A column, wherein the wash is performed without the presence of a nonbuffering salt.
      In yet another aspect, the method optionally includes equilibrating the Protein A column prior to loading and/or eluting the protein of interest (e.g., an antibody, antibody fragment, or protein comprising an Fc region (e.g., an Fc fusion protein)) from the Protein A column. For example, the invention provides a method of producing a purified antibody, antibody fragment, or protein comprising an Fc region (e.g., an Fc fusion protein) using a Protein A column, the method comprising (a) equilibrating the Protein A column (e.g., using an equilibration buffer, to adjust pH and remove any residual storage buffer); (b) loading a mixture comprising the antibody, antibody fragment, or protein onto the Protein A column; (c) washing the Protein A column with a wash solution comprising (i) arginine, or an arginine derivative, at a pH of greater than 8.0 (e.g., about 8.5-9.5 or about 8.9-9.0); and (d) eluting the antibody, antibody fragment, or protein from the Protein A column, wherein the wash is performed without the presence of a nonbuffering salt. The method may further comprise the step of equilibrating the Protein A column prior to eluting the antibody, antibody fragment, or protein.
      In a particular embodiment, the wash solution comprises arginine or arginine-HCl, preferably at a concentration in a range of about 0.1-0.5 M. In another particular embodiment, arginine or arginine-HCl is present at a concentration of 0.25 M or about 0.25 M. In still other particular embodiments, the wash solution comprises an arginine derivative, such as a derivative selected from the group consisting of acetyl arginine, N-alpha-butyroyl-arginine, agmatine, arginic acid and N-alpha-pyvaloyl arginine.
      The method of the invention is effective in removing a variety of impurities, including high and low molecular weight (HMW and LMW, respectively) species and host cell proteins (HCPs). In a particular embodiment, the wash solution further comprises one or more buffering salts (e.g., sodium acetate, sodium phosphate or Tris).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2743681,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The pharmaceutical use of antibodies has increased over the past years. In many instances such antibodies are injected via the intravenous (IV) route. Unfortunately the amount of antibody that can be injected via the intravenous route is limited by the physico-chemical properties of the antibody, in particularly by its solubility and stability in a suitable liquid formulation and by the volume of the infusion fluid. Alternative administration pathways are subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, which offer potential advantages in terms of patient compliance and ease of administration. These injection pathways require high protein concentration in the final solution to be injected.
      Accordingly, there is a desire to provide highly concentrated, stable pharmaceutical formulations of therapeutically active antigen binding proteins such as antibodies for subcutaneous injection. The advantage of subcutaneous injections is that it allows the medical practitioner to perform it in a rather short intervention with the patient. Moreover the patient can be trained to perform the subcutaneous injection by himself. Such self-administration is particularly useful during maintenance dosing because no hospital care is needed (reduced medical resource utilization). Usually injections via the subcutaneous route are limited to approximately 2 mL. For patients requiring multiple doses, several unit dose formulations can be injected at multiple sites of the body surface.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200300793,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       A number of indolinone derivatives have been found to exhibit pharmaceutical activity. Due to the ability to modulate the protein kinase activity, they have been suggested to treat an number of conditions such as various types of cancer, mastocytosis, allergy associated chronic rhinitis, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, restenosis, fibrosis, psoriasis, von Hippel-Lindau disease, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, angiogensis, inflammatory disorders, immunological disorders, and cardiovascular disorders (WO 01/45689, WO 01/60814, WO 99/48868, U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,429, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,316,635, 6,133,305, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,771).
       Among the indolinone derivatives those having an amide group on a heterocyclic ring condensed with the indolinone have been of interest. These compounds modulate protein kinase activity and are thus useful in treating diseases relating to abnormal protein kinase activity. A process for preparing the amide derivatives is disclosed in WO 01/60814. An appropriate pyrrole is formylated and subsequently condensed with a 2-indolinone to give a respective 5-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydroindole-3-ylidenemethyl)-1H-pyrrole. If an amide derivative of the pyrrole is desired, a pyrrole having a carboxylic acid group is selected. The carboxylic acid group is reacted with the desired amine in the presence of dimethylformamide, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. In example 129 a scale-up procedure is disclosed in which the amidation is conducted in the presence of dimethylformamide, benzotriazole-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and triethylamine.
       It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for preparing indolinone derivatives which have an amide group on a heterocyclic ring condensed with the indolinone.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
2426738,"BACKGROUND
      Production of biological macromolecules, particularly proteins, often involves purity-enhancing steps based on physical and physicochemical properties. Difficulties encountered in such process steps include, but are not limited to, determining conditions which enable separation of soluble and insoluble molecules, relatively low recovery of the desired molecule after a treatment step, loss of biological activity in the course of the process, and sensitivity of the protein to process step conditions such as pH.
      Surfactants have been utilized in the processing of biological macromolecules. Cationic surfactants are a recognized subclass of surfactants, and include amphipathic ammonium compounds. Amphipathic ammonium compounds comprise quaternary ammonium compounds of the general formula QN + and paraffin chain primary ammonium compounds of the general formula RNH 3 +. Both types of amphipathic ammonium compounds include long-chain ammonium surfactants that have a long aliphatic chain of preferably at least six carbon atoms (Scott (1960) Methods Biochem. Anal. 8:145-197, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The long-chain quaternary ammonium surfactants are known to interact with biological macromolecules. The long-chain quaternary ammonium compounds have at least one substituent at the nitrogen which consists of a linear alkyl chain with 6-20 carbon atoms. The best known representatives of this class are the benzalkonium salts (chlorides and bromides), hexadecylpyridinium chloride dequalinium acetate, cetyldimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and hexadecylpyridinium chloride (CPCl), and benzethonium chloride. Quaternary ammonium surfactants include salts such as cetyl pyridinium salts, e.g. cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), stearamide-methylpyridinium salts, lauryl pyridinium salts, cetyl quinolynium salts, lauryl aminopropionic acid methyl ester salts, lauryl amino propionic acid metal salts, lauryl dimethyl betaine stearyl dimethyl betaine, lauryl dihydroxyethyl betaine and benzethonium salts. Alkyl pyridinium salts comprise stearyl-trimethyl ammonium salts, alkyl-dimethylbenzyl-ammonium chloride, and dichloro-benzyldimethyl-alkylammonium chloride.
      Known uses of cationic surfactants for purifying biological macromolecules include 1) solubilization of aggregates, including protein aggregates; 2) elution of chromatographic column-bound biological macromolecules; and 3) precipitation of polyanions such as hyaluronic acid (HA), nucleic acids, and heparin (and molecules which co-precipitate with polyanions).
      Cationic surfactants have been used for solubilizing protein aggregates. Otta and Bertini ((1975) Acta Physiol. Latinoam. 25:451-457, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) demonstrated that active uricase could be solubilized from rodent liver peroxizomes with the quaternary ammonium surfactant, Hyamine 2389. It is found that increase of the ammonium surfactant concentration resulted in increase of dissolution of both uricase (based on enzymatic activity) and total protein such that there is no increase in the relative amount of uricase protein with respect to the amount of total protein. In other words, there was no selective solubilization of the uricase protein with respect to the total protein, and the uricase protein did not constitute a higher percentage of the total protein upon solubilization with the cationic surfactant. Thus, in this process, uricase purity with respect to the total protein content is apparently not enhanced as a result of quaternary ammonium surfactant solubilization.
      In another study, Truscoe ((1967) Enzymologia 33:1 19-32, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) examined a panel of cationic, anionic, and neutral detergents for their extraction efficacy of urate oxidase (uricase) from ox kidney powders. While the neutral and anionic detergents were found to enhance soluble urate oxidase activity, the cationic detergents, e.g., quaternary ammonium salts, were found to decrease total enzymatic activity with increasing concentration. The authors concluded that cationic detergents were not useful for purifying ox kidney urate oxidase
      Solubilization of recombinant proteins, porcine growth hormone, methionyl-porcine growth hormone, infectious bursal disease virus protein, B-galactosidase fusion protein, from E. coli inclusion bodies or cells, with cationic surfactants is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,797,474, U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,531, U.S. Pat. No. 4,966,963, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,008,377, each incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Solubilization under alkaline conditions is accomplished using quaternary ammonium compounds including cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, mixed n-alkyl dimethyl benzylammonium chloride, CPC, N,N-dimethyl-N-[2-[2-[4-(1,1,3,3,-tetramethylbutyl)-phenoxy]ethoxy]ethyl]benzenemethanammonium chloride, tetradecyl trimethylammonium bromide, dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide. These publications mention that, after each solubilization process, the solutions are centrifuged, and little to no pellet is observed in each case. This observation suggests that most or all of the proteins are solubilized without regard to selectivity for the solubilization of a target protein. The purity of the recovered proteins is not indicated. U.S. Pat. No. 5,929,231, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) disintegration of granules and aggregates containing starches. Thus, the prior art relates to use of cationic surfactants for general, nonspecific solubilization of particulate biological macromolecules. These methods of the prior art do not disclose increasing the purity of a desired target protein with respect to total protein with a cationic surfactant.
      Cationic surfactants have also been used to elute biological macromolecules adsorbed to cation exchange resins or aluminum-containing adjuvants (Antonopoulos, et al. (1961) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 54:213-226; Embery (1976) J. Biol. Buccale 4:229-236; and Rinella, et al. (1998) J. Colloid Interface Sci. 197:48-56, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). U.S. Pat. No. 4,169,764, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes elution of urokinase from carboxymethyl cellulose columns using a wide variety of cationic surfactant solutions. The authors state a preference for using tetra substituted ammonium salts in which one alkyl group is a higher alkyl group up to 20 carbon atoms and the others are lower alkyl groups up to 6 carbon atoms. Use of such cationic surfactants enables removal of biological macromolecules from their attachment to a solid matrix.
      Conversely, impregnation of filters such as those composed of nylon, with cationic surfactant enables immobilizing of polysaccharides or nucleic acids (Maccari and Volpi (2002) Electrophoresis 23:3270-3277; Benitz, et al. (1990) U.S. Pat. No. 4,945,086; Macfarlane (1991) U.S. Pat. No. 5,010,183, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). This phenomenon is apparently due to cationic surfactant-polyanion interactions which enable precipitation of the polyanion.
      It is well established that amphipathic ammonium compounds, which comprise quaternary ammonium compounds of the general formula QN + and paraffin chain primary ammonium compounds of the general formula RNH 3 +, can precipitate polyanions under defined conditions (reviewed in Scott (1955) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 18:428-429; Scott (1960) Methods Biochem. Anal. 8:145-197; Laurent, et al., (1960) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 42:476-485; Scott (1961) Biochem.

Biochem. 203:103-112, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). This precipitation is dependent on the precipitating species having a high polyanion charge density and high molecular weight (Saito (1955) Kolloid-Z 143:66, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The presence of salts can interfere with or reverse cationic surfactant-induced precipitation of polyanions.
      Additionally, polyanions can be differentially precipitated from solutions containing protein contaminants, under alkaline pH conditions. In such cases, proteins not chemically bound to the polyanions will remain in solution, while the polyanions and other molecules bound to the polyanions will precipitate. For example, precipitation of polyanions such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids is accompanied by co-precipitation of molecules such as proteoglycans and proteins interacting with the polyanions (Blumberg and Ogston (1958) Biochem. J. 68:183-188; Matsumura, et al., (1963) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 69: 574-576; Serafini-Fracassini, et al. (1967) Biochem. J. 105:569-575; Smith, et al. (1984) J. Biol.

      The isoelectric point (or pI) of a protein is the pH at which the protein has an equal number of positive and negative charges. Under solution conditions with pH values close to (especially below) a protein's isoelectric point, proteins can form stable salts with strongly acidic polyanions such as heparin. Under conditions which promote precipitation of such polyanions, the proteins complexed with the polyanions also precipitate (L B Jaques (1943) Biochem. J. 37:189-195; A S Jones (1953) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 10:607-612; J E Scott (1955) Chem and Ind 168-169; U.S. Pat. No. 3,931,399 (Bohn, et al., 1976) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,297,344 (Schwinn, et al., 1981), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,421,650, U.S. Pat. No. 5,633,227, and Smith, et al. ((1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259:11046-11051, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) describe purification of polyanions by sequential treatment with a cationic surfactant and ammonium sulfate (that enables dissociation of polyanion-cationic surfactant complexes) and subsequent separation using hydrophobic interactions chromatography. European patent publication EP055188, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes cationic surfactant-enabled separation of RTX toxin from lipopolysaccharide. However, there is no mass balance in the amount of lipopolysaccharide that is quantified by endotoxin activity assays. Neutralization of endotoxin activity by strongly interacting cationic compounds has been demonstrated (Cooper J F (1990) J Parenter Sci Technol 44:13-5, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Thus, in EP055188, the lack of endotoxin activity in the precipitate following treatment with increasing amounts of cationic surfactant possibly results from neutralization of the activity by surfactant-lipopolysaccharide complex formation.
      The above-mentioned methods require intermediary polyanions, solid supports or aggregates comprising proteins with selective solubility by a cationic surfactant for enabling purification of soluble proteins using cationic surfactant. Hence, the prior art does not provide a method of purifying a target protein by contacting the protein with a cationic surfactant in an amount effective to preferentially precipitate proteins other than the target protein, i.e., contaminating proteins, particularly when such contacting is done in the absence of intermediary polyanions, solid supports, or aggregates of proteins. Often, one skilled in the art encounters mixtures of soluble proteins and does not have a simple, efficient means for purifying the desired protein. The novel method for purifying proteins, described herein, enables efficient purification of target proteins by using cationic surfactants to preferentially precipitate proteins other than the target protein. Preferably such precipitation of contaminating proteins is direct, and does not depend upon the presence of polyanions, solid supports or aggregates comprising the contaminating proteins and other molecules.

2725954,"BACKGROUND ART
      Tumor is a serious disease that threatens human health and is difficult to prevent effectively. At present, the main methods for treating tumors include radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgical treatment, but the therapeutic effect thereof is not satisfying, and the 5-year survival rate after surgery is low. Currently, development of an effective drug for the treatment of tumors is a hot topic in cancer research. In recent years, immune checkpoint therapy represented by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 has been explored as a new approach for tumor treatment. Three PD-1/PD-L1 antibody drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical treatment. Although these drugs have certain effects, they have drawbacks such as low efficiency, side effects and off-target. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a drug that is efficient, long-lasting and has a wide range of therapeutic effects.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The target peptide of the invention is obtained by chemical synthesis and purification. The dissociation constant between the peptide and PD-L1 protein is determined by ELISA, and the blocking effect of the peptide on PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is determined. The affinity of the peptide for PD-L1 protein expressed on the surface of tumor cells was detected by flow cytometry. Finally, the peptide is infused into a mouse tumor model, and the potential value of the peptide in treating tumor is confirmed by the changes in tumor size and survival time of the mouse.
      The object of the present invention is to provide a peptide having high binding affinity for PD-L1 protein and use of the peptide in treatment of tumor.
      The present disclosure provides a peptide having high affinity for human PD-L1 protein (referred to as PPLC), wherein the peptide has an amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ. ID. NO. 1. The peptide has the following functional characteristics: (1) a high affinity for human PD-L1 protein, with a dissociation constant Kd of 0.75μ M (Kd value indicates the concentration of ligand when half of the receptors are bound by the ligand, and the smaller the Kd value, the higher the affinity of the receptor to the ligand); (2) it can effectively block the affinity of PD-1/PD-L1 protein; (3) it can effectively binds to PD-L1 protein expressed on the cell surface; (4) infusion of the peptide into tumor-injected animals can effectively inhibit tumor growth and extend the survival time of animals.

ID. NO. 5.
      The present disclosure also provides a peptide modified by biological or chemical group, comprising SEQ. ID. NO. 1, SEQ. ID. NO. 3 or SEQ. ID.

      The present disclosure also provides a modified peptide, comprising the above peptide having high affinity for PD-L1 protein, which is labeled with a FITC fluorophore, an isotope, a chemiluminescent group or an enzyme reagent, and the modified peptide can be used for PD-L1 protein detection.
      The present disclosure also provides the use of the above peptide having high affinity for PD-L1 protein in preparation of a PD-L1 protein antagonist.
      The present disclosure also provides the use of the above peptide having high affinity for PD-L1 protein in preparation of an agent for detection or for clinical testing of PD-L1 protein expression.
      The present disclosure also provides the use of a gene having nucleotide sequence as set forth in SEQ. ID. NO. 2 in preparation of a PD-L1 protein antagonist or preparation of an agent for tracer detection of PD-L1 protein.
      The peptide of the present invention having the amino acid sequence of SEQ. ID. NO. 1 can be used as a PD-L1 protein antagonist drug. The peptide has a high binding affinity for PD-L1 protein, blocks the negative regulatory signaling pathway PD-1/PD-L1 of human immunity and thus activates immunity, initiates the killing effect of T cells on tumors, and can be used as a potential drug for tumor targeted therapy. The peptide of present invention having the amino acid sequence of SEQ. ID. NO. 3 or SEQ. ID. NO. 4 can also be used as an antagonist of PD-L1 protein. These peptides also have a high binding affinity for PD-L1 protein, block the affinity of PD-1/PD-L1 and initiate immunity to kill tumor cells.
      Affinity assay of PPLC peptide to PD-L1 protein.
      A 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 2μg/ml PD-L1 protein at 4° C. overnight. Different concentrations of PPLC peptide labeled with FITC were added to each well and incubated for 1 h. After incubation, HRP-conjugated anti-FITC antibody was added, incubated for 1 h, and then ABTS coloring solution was added. The OD value at 410 nm was measured using a M5 microplate reader, and GraphPad Prism 6 was used for plotting and analysis. The results demonstrate that PPLC peptide has a strong affinity for PD-L1 protein, with a dissociation constant Kd of 0.75μM ( FIG. 1).
      Competitive binding assay between PPLC peptide and PD-1 to PD-L1 protein.
      A 96-well ELISA plate was coated with 2μg/ml PD-L1 protein at 4° C. overnight. Different concentrations of PPLC peptide and 1μg/ml PD-1 protein were mixed and incubated together. After incubation, rabbit anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody was added as primary antibody, and then HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG monoclonal antibody was added as secondary antibody. After ABTS color development, the OD value at 410 nm was measured using a M5 microplate reader, and GraphPad Prism 6 was used for plotting and analysis. The results demonstrate that PPLC peptide can effectively block the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 ( FIG. 2).
      Binding assay of PPLC peptide to PD-L1 protein expressed on the cell surface.
      The recombinant plasmid expressing recombinant human PD-L1 protein was transfected into CHO cell line and incubated for 36 hours. After incubation, anit-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody or PPLC peptide labeled with FITC was added and incubated at 4° C. for 30 minutes. After incubation, flow cytometry was performed ( FIG. 3). After transfection of the plasmid, the cells were further cultured for 36 hours, and then the PPLC peptide labeled with FITC was added and incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes. After incubation, fluorescence confocal detection was performed ( FIG. 4). The results demonstrate that the PPLC peptide can efficiently bind to the PD-L1 protein expressed on the cell surface ( FIG. 3 and FIG. 4).
      Effect of PPLC peptide on tumor volume in animal tumor models.
      The experimental animals were divided into two groups: PBS group and PPLC group. Tumors were injected subcutaneously into 6 weeks old female Balb/c mice. Two weeks later, when the tumor size reached 100 mm 3, PPLC drug treatment was performed. The size of the mouse tumor was measured daily and the change was recorded. The results demonstrate that PPLC peptide can significantly reduce the growth rate of mouse tumor ( FIG. 5) and prolong the survival time of mice ( FIG. 6).
      It can be seen that the peptide provided herein has a strong affinity for PD-L1 protein and can block the affinity of PD-1/PD-L1 protein in human. Thus, the peptide can break the immune tolerance of tumors, activate immunity, initiate killing effect of T cells on tumors, and achieve the purpose of tumor treatment. Therefore, the peptide can be used as a drug for tumor targeted therapy. Since the PPLC peptide has high affinity for PD-L1 protein, it can be used to prepare a probe for detecting PD-L1 protein. When the PPLC peptide is labeled with a FITC fluorophore, an isotope, a chemiluminescent group or an enzyme reagent, it can be used for quantitative, qualitative and location detection of the presence of PD-L1 protein in various biological samples and cells.

2742724,"BACKGROUND
      Photoreceptors are the first neurons in the retina to receive and process visual information, converting visible electromagnetic radiation into hyperpolarized responses through phototransduction. The overwhelming majority of inherited retinal diseases result in the loss of these cells, either directly, such as in dominant mutations that affect rhodopsin protein folding, or indirectly, such as in recessive mutations that affect retinal recycling pathways in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
      AAV belongs to the Parvoviridae family and Dependovirus genus, whose members require co-infection with a helper virus such as adenovirus to promote replication, and AAV establishes a latent infection in the absence of a helper. Virions are composed of a 25 nm icosahedral capsid encompassing a 4.9 kb single-stranded DNA genome with two open reading frames: rep and cap. The non-structural rep gene encodes four regulatory proteins essential for viral replication, whereas cap encodes three structural proteins (VP1-3) that assemble into a 60-mer capsid shell. This viral capsid mediates the ability of AAV vectors to overcome many of the biological barriers of viral transduction—including cell surface receptor binding, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and unpackaging in the nucleus.

200970782,"BACKGROUND
      Erythropoietin (EPO), a well known glycoprotein was originally identified for its hormonal effects on the bone marrow and is involved in the growth and development of mature red blood cells. In addition to this hematopoietic activity it has recently been discovered that EPO also functions as a potent, locally produced molecule ameliorating metabolic stress in many tissues. The tissue protective activities of EPO are mediated through interaction with the erythropoietin receptor. In the brain, for example, EPO and its receptor are locally produced, modulated by metabolic stressors, and provide neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory functions (Doggrell, S A. (2004) Expert Opin Investig Drugs; 13(11):1517-9). In the spinal cord, EPO provides beneficial effects including inhibition of apoptosis and necrosis of neurons, oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells, less cavitations, reduction of lipid peroxidation, mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells, promotion of angiogenesis and restoration of vascular autoregulation (Gorio, A. et al (2002) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA; 99(14):9450-5; Leist M. (2004) Science; 305(5681):239-42). EPO has been shown to signal through modulation of members of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway as well as by the janus kinase-2/signal transducers and activators of transcription-5 system (Gorio A. (2005) Neurosurgery; 56(4):821-7; Grasso G. (2005) Neurosurgery; 56(4):821-7).
      By chemical modification, i.e. carbamoylation of at least one primary amino group of the lysines and/or of the N-terminal amino acid of EPO the hematopoietic activity of this cytokine is considerably reduced while its tissue protective activity, i.e. its nerval cell regenerative activity remains substantially unaltered or is even enhanced as compared to uncarbamoylated EPO.
      WO 2006/014466 and WO 2006/002646 disclose the manufacture and use of carbamoylated EPO for various medical indications.
      Since EPO has a relatively short serum half-life and since it is well known in the art that the fusion of an immunoglobulin constant region to a non-immuno-globulin protein can markedly prolong the serum half-life of said non-immuno-globulin protein, several approaches have been made linking an immunoglobulin fragment to EPO. For example, WO 99/02709 discloses the production and use of fusion proteins comprising EPO and an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin, wherein the EPO-Fc fusion proteins have an increased in vivo half-life relative to naturally occurring EPO.
      From WO2005/063808 it is known that a further improvement of the pharmacokinetics, i.e. prolonged serum half-lives and increased in vivo potency of EPO-Fc fusion proteins can be obtained by mutations, deletions or insertions of specific amino acids.
      Accordingly, there is a need for a simplified and less costly EPO therapy, i.e. requiring less frequent EPO administration, for the treatment of diseases, wherein an unaltered or even enhanced tissue regenerative activity, i.e. the nerve cell regenerative activity of EPO, is desirable while simultaneously the hematopoietic activity of EPO is less desirable or is even undesired and shall thus be reduced. Such diseases include but are not limited to malfunctions or impairments of either or both the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems, and particularly include diseases that are associated with or caused by injuries to the CNS and/or PNS such as physical damages following, for example, a mechanical impact.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      It is thus an objective of the present invention to improve the known EPO-Fc fusion proteins, which have a prolonged serum half-life as compared to unfused EPO proteins, by chemical modification, i.e. carbamoylation, to obtain modified EPO-Fc fusion proteins, which have, in addition to the prolonged serum half-life, a reduced hematopoietic activity but yet an unaltered or enhanced regenerative activity as compared to unmodified EPO-Fc fusion proteins.
      The modified EPO-Fc fusion proteins according to the present invention are suitable for the treatment of diseases or malfunctions of either or both the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems, including diseases that are caused by or associated with physical damage of nerves caused by, for example, mechanical impact, heat or irradiation. It is one of the advantageous features of the modified EPO-Fc fusion proteins of the present invention that they may be administered at higher therapeutic doses as compared to conventional EPO or EPO-Fc for the same purpose, and essentially without augmenting undesired effects on the hematopoietic system, i.e. the blood count.
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a modified recombinant EPO fusion protein, wherein EPO is linked to a protein carrier, in particular to an immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin fragment such as an Fc fragment, more particular to the Fc portion of an IgG molecule, and wherein said recombinant fusion protein is further modified by carbamoylation.
      It is another object of the invention to provide a method for the preparation of such carbamoylated recombinant EPO-Fc fusion protein.
      It is yet another object of the invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions containing such a carbamoylated recombinant EPO-Fc fusion protein.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200702081,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by infection with M. tuberculosis and other Mycobacterium species. It is a major disease in developing countries, as well as an increasing problem in developed areas of the world, with about 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths each year. Although the infection may be asymptomatic for a considerable period of time, the disease is most commonly manifested as an acute inflammation of the lungs, resulting in fever and a nonproductive cough. If untreated, serious complications and death typically result.
      Although tuberculosis can generally be controlled using extended antibiotic therapy, such treatment is not sufficient to prevent the spread of the disease. Infected individuals may be asymptomatic, but contagious, for some time. In addition, although compliance with the treatment regimen is critical, patient behavior is difficult to monitor. Some patients do not complete the course of treatment, which can lead to ineffective treatment and the development of drug resistance. Even if a full course of treatment is completed, infection with M. tuberculosis is not eradicated from the infected individual but remains as a latent infection that can be reactivated.
      In order to control the spread of tuberculosis, effective vaccination and accurate early diagnosis of the disease are of utmost importance. Currently, vaccination with live bacteria is the most efficient method for inducing protective immunity. The most common mycobacterium employed for this purpose is Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an avirulent strain of M. bovis. However, the safety and efficacy of BCG is a source of controversy and some countries, such as the United States, do not vaccinate the general public with this agent.
      Diagnosis of tuberculosis is commonly achieved using a skin test, which involves intradermal exposure to tuberculin PPD (protein-purified derivative). Antigen-specific T cell responses result in measurable induration at the injection site by 48-72 hours after injection, which indicates exposure to mycobacterial antigens. Sensitivity and specificity have, however, been a problem with this test, and individuals vaccinated with BCG cannot be distinguished from infected individuals.
      While macrophages have been shown to act as the principal effectors of Mycobacterium immunity, T cells are the predominant inducers of such immunity. The essential role of T cells in protection against Mycobacterium infection is illustrated by the frequent occurrence of Mycobacterium infection in AIDS patients, due to the depletion of CD4 + T cells associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Mycobacterium-reactive CD4 + T cells have been shown to be potent producers of γ-interferon (IFN-γ), which, in turn, has been shown to trigger the anti-mycobacterial effects of macrophages in mice. While the role of IFN-γ in humans is less clear, studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, either alone or in combination with IFN-γ or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, activates human macrophages to inhibit M. tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, it is known that IFN-γ stimulates human macrophages to make 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3. Similarly, interleukin-12 (IL-12) has been shown to play a role in stimulating resistance to M. tuberculosis infection. For a review of the immunology of M. tuberculosis infection, see Chan & Kaufmann, Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control (Bloom ed., 1994), Tuberculosis (2nd ed., Rom and Garay, eds., 2003), and Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Chapter 150, pp. 953-966 (16th ed., Braunwald, et al., eds., 2005).
      There remains a need for effective treatment strategies to prevent reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections, from both active and latent infections. This invention fulfills this and other needs.

By shortening the time course of chemotherapy against a M. tuberculosis infection, the present methods are also effective in enhancing the compliance of an individual being treated for a M. tuberculosis infection in completing an entire course of treatment.

2765431,"BACKGROUND ART
      Frizzled proteins are a family of G-protein coupled receptors that have a binding site for Wnt protein ligands. Gene analyses have identified 18 Wnt genes and ten Frizzled genes (FZD1 to FZD10) so far, and these are known to be all structurally highly similar.
      Frizzled proteins are seven-transmembrane proteins which have an extracellular cysteine-rich domain at the N terminus. This cysteine rich domain is the binding site for Wnt ligands. The binding between Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors is not necessarily one to one. It has been found that one Wnt ligand binds to multiple Frizzled receptors, and multiple Wnt ligands to one Frizzled receptor.
      It is said that binding between a Wnt ligand and a Frizzled receptor activates a Wnt signaling pathway. There are a number of Wnt signaling pathways that either activate the β-catenin pathway or do not involve β-catenin, and it is considered that different Wnt ligand/Frizzled receptor combinations activate different pathways.
      The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activated upon receptor binding is mediated by the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dsh) interacting directly with the Frizzled receptor and results in the cytoplasmic stabilization and accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. In the absence of a Wnt signal, β-catenin is localized to a cytoplasmic destruction complex including the tumor suppressor proteins adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin. These proteins function as critical scaffolds for glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β to bind and phosphorylate β-catenin, marking it for degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Patent Document 1). The β-catenin-independent pathway has been shown to participate in a number of processes which include planar cellular polarity (PCP) involved in regulation of the cytoskeletal system, Wnt/Ca 2+pathway involved in cell motility and adhesion, and pathways involved in regulation of myogenesis via protein kinase A. Frizzled receptors can be dimerized, and this dimerization has been reported to be involved in activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (Non-patent Document 1).
      FZD10 (reference sequence: Genbank Accession Number NM_007197.3 (SEQ ID NO:21)) mRNA has been reported to be upregulated in many cancer cell lines including cell lines of the cervical region, digestive tract, and glioblastoma, and in approximately 40% of primary stomach cancer and primary colon cancer, and most synovial sarcoma tissues (Patent Documents 1 and 2, and Non-patent Documents 2 and 3). Examples of diseases relating to overexpression of the FZD10 protein include synovial sarcoma, colorectal cancer (large intestine cancer), stomach cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Patent Documents 3 to 5). Therefore, FZD10 is considered to be an appropriate target for anticancer agents, and FZD10-specific siRNAs have been shown to suppress proliferation of synovial sarcoma cells, and antibodies against FZD10 have been shown to have antitumor activity in a mouse graft model of synovial sarcoma (Patent Documents 3 and 4). Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies against FZD10 may be predicted to be useful as diagnostic agents in therapies. In addition to successful cases of clinical application of monoclonal antibodies, such as diagnostic agents for trastuzumab, rituximab, and bevacizumab against breast cancer, malignant lymphoma, and colon cancer, development of several monoclonal antibodies against other molecular targets is ongoing, and their diagnostic effects are being evaluated. From the viewpoint of selecting patients effectively responding to therapeutic agents, these diagnostic agents are expected to lead to more effective therapies.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problems to be Solved by the Invention
      In treatment of tumor using a molecular target drug, it is important for a diagnostic agent to detect a cell protein that is overexpressed in the most part of the target tumor and not expressed or only minimally expressed in normal tissues. However, specific, highly sensitive detection of a protein expressed in tumors is difficult, and antibodies against such a protein are also difficult to obtain. For example, for FZD10, which is considered to be a target for anticancer agents, several antibodies are commercially available. However, when commercially-available antibodies obtained by the present inventors were used to stain FZD10-expressing cells, even cells with low FZD10 expression levels sometimes gave a positive signal (false positive). Thus, there is a concern that antibodies with insufficient immunological specificity might not allow different FZD10 expression levels to be clearly detected using the intensity of antibody reaction as an indicator. Therefore, an objective of the present invention is to provide antibodies that bind to FZD10 with specificity and high sensitivity.
Means for Solving the Problems
      Accordingly, the present inventors searched for antibodies that bind specifically to FZD10 from among monoclonal antibodies obtained by immunizing mice with a FZD10 antigen, and succeeded in identifying a particular antibody clone which can specifically bind to a recombinant human FZD10 protein and can specifically detect a FZD10 protein expressed in cells and tissues.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
2648455,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Digestion of dietary proteins is achieved by the release of proteases from the stomach and the pancreas. The release of proteases is normally tightly regulated, thereby ensuring that not too less and not too much proteolytic enzymes are secreted. This is important since a high release of proteases and a high proteolytic activity has several disadvantages. A too high release of proteases will result in energy loss and a loss of essential amino acids due to the fact that proteases themselves are highly resistant to proteolytic activity and will enter into the colon mostly unaltered. Subsequently, upon entering of an increased amount of protein (in the form of proteases) into the colon, the intestinal microbiota will ferment the proteins resulting in a disadvantageously higher pH, a shift in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and formation of toxic metabolites such as phenol, indol, and amines. This change in colonic physiology may also lead to increased intestinal infections. Finally, proteases such as trypsin are known to cleave protease activated receptors (PARs), such as PAR-II, and thereby disrupt intestinal barrier integrity. This may result in an increased abdominal pain perception. Inflammatory diseases such as IBS-D and UC have been linked to elevated levels of proteolytic activity within the intestinal lumen and subsequent PAR-II activation. Furthermore, increased faecal proteolytic activity is linked to diaper rashes. In general, a too high release of proteases will result in decreasing gastrointestinal comfort, functional digestive disorders, gastrointestinal gas formation, and/or bloating.
      A too low secretion of proteolytic activity, on the other hand, is disadvantageous since in that case the dietary proteins are not properly digested leading also to loss of essential amino acids and energy, and an increased protein load of the colon.
      Especially in infants and toddlers a tight regulation of protein digestion and release of proteolytic activity is of utmost importance. Firstly, for infants and toddlers a limited loss of protein is essential for good growth and development. Loss of essential amino acids and energy impairs growth and development. Secondly, the intestinal barrier function in infants and toddlers is still immature and the intestinal microbiota is still developing and therefore more susceptible for the disadvantages mentioned above. Pain perception e.g. due to colics or cramps often is a great cause of concern and initiates many doctor visits and thus reduction of the risk of pain perception, for example prevention and/or treatment of colics and/or cramps is desired.
      Known ways to improve protein digestion, in particular in infants, involve partial predigestion of dietary proteins by proteases. Furthermore, Alm, 1982, J Dairy Sci 65:509-514 discloses that a low pH of milk products, especially as a result of fermentation, has a positive influence on in vitro digestibility of proteins. It is considered that in many digestive disorders the secretion of hydrochloric acid is impaired and thus the suitability of such low pH milk products is suggested for infants, children and adults. Vass et al, 1984, Acta Medica Hungarica, 41, 15-161 disclose that fermented milks have the highest protein utilization index, defined as increase in body mass in g per protein intake in g, in weaning rats, and this is attributed to a better digestibility of proteins.
      Gallia Lactofidus® is an acidified infant formula, resulting from fermentation by two specific strains of lactic acid bacteria. It is disclosed that this formula facilitates the digestibility of proteins and improves the intestinal transit.
      WO 2009/151330 discloses fermented infant formula with non digestible oligosaccharides for use in improving intestinal colonization in infants born via Caesarean section.
      US 2011/097437 discloses nutritional compositions comprising non-digestible oligosaccharides and a protein substrate fermented with Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus for use in reduction of bacterial translocation and improvement of intestinal barrier function.
      US 2010/278781 discloses a protein comprising composition, fermented by Bifidobacterium breve and comprising non-digestible oligosaccharides with several health benefits.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The inventors have found that, employing piglets as animal model, upon consumption of a fermented formula the amount of endogenous proteolytic enzymes detected at the terminal ileum was significantly reduced compared to the amount detected upon consumption of a standard non fermented formula. Surprisingly, the amount of endogenous proteolytic enzymes was also significantly reduced compared to the amount detected upon consumption of a formula with extensively hydrolysed (i.e. predigested) proteins.
      In addition and unexpectedly as well, the apparent and true protein digestibility was the highest in the piglets consuming the fermented formula as well, even though their daily protein intake was higher. This is indicative for a decreased digestive effort. Digestive effort is defined as the amount of protease activity secreted per gram of ingested protein. Digestive efficiency is defined as reciprocal value of digestive effort. This means that at high digestive efficiency (little protease needed to digest the ingested protein) the digestive effort is low.
      The inventors further found that the proteolytic activity in faecal samples of exclusively breast fed human infants was lower than that of infants fed with a standard formula. When the formula administered to the human infants comprised non digestible oligosaccharides the proteolytic activity in the faecal samples was lower with similar values as observed for the breast fed human infants.
      So, upon feeding a protein comprising fermented formula, the release of endogenous protease, digestive effort, endogenous protein loss in the small intestine and the protein load entering the colon is advantageously reduced. The additional presence of non digestible oligosaccharides reduces the proteolytic activity of the microbiota in the colon. Hence an infant or toddler formula being both fermented and comprising non digestible oligosaccharides will have a further improved effect on reducing protein fermentation and proteolytic activity in the colon. Moreover, an infant or toddler formula being both fermented and comprising non digestible oligosaccharides will have a beneficial effect regarding proteolytic activity reduction along the entire, i.e. both small and large, intestinal tract. Therefore a fermented formula comprising non digestible oligosaccharides is advantageously used as nutrition for infants or toddlers for use in preventing and/or treatment of diaper rashes or in promoting intestinal tract health by reducing digestive effort, improving protein digestion efficiency, reducing endogenous protein loss, reducing endogenous secretion of proteases, reducing colonic protein fermentation and/or reducing the protein load entering the colon.
      The finding that protein digestion efficiency is increased, and endogenous protein loss is decreased also advantageously enables the formulation of an infant [or toddler] formula with lower protein concentrations than used so far.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
WO/2018/139956,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Bioluminescence refers to the ability of biological organisms or biomolecules to produce and emit light. Ability to produce bioluminescence is determined by the presence of a specific protein: a luciferase or a photoprotein. Luciferases are enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of low molecular weight compounds, i. e. luciferins, and convert them into oxyluciferins. The oxidation is accompanied by the emission of light and release of oxyluciferin.
      Photoproteins also catalyze the oxidation of luciferin; however, in this case, luciferin acts as a prosthetic group to form a stable photoprotein complex. The quantity of light produced by a photoprotein is approximately proportional to a concentration thereof, while for luciferase it depends on concentrations of both the enzyme and luciferin. In many cases, bioluminescent reaction catalyzed by a photoprotein is activated in response to release of metal ions in the medium. For example, aequorin photoprotein catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin (coelenterazine) in response to release of calcium ions, which results in emitting short flashes of light.
      Luciferases are used as reporter genes in many applications of biomedicine and biotechnology. In particular, they are used in diagnostic methods, methods for detecting microorganisms and toxic agents in a medium; they are also used for determining concentrations of various substances, for detecting activation of signalling cascades, etc. [Scott et al., Annu Rev Anal Chem, 2011, 4: 297-319; Badr and Tannous, Trends Biotechnol. 2011, 29: 624-33; Andreu et al., FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011, 35: 360-94]. Many methods of the application of luciferases have been reviewed [Kaskova et al., Chem Soc Rev., 2016, 45: 6048-6077; Scott et al., Annu Rev Anal Chem, 2011, 4: 297-319; Widder and Falls, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, 2014, 20: 232-241].
      Several types of bioluminescent systems are known nowadays. It has been shown that various organisms developed them independently in the course of evolution more than forty times [Herring, Journal of Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence, 1987, 1: 147-63; Haddock et al., Annual Review of Marine Science, 2010; 2: 443-93].
      Luciferase from Photinus pyralis (North American firefly) catalyzing the oxidation of D-luciferin has been described [de Wet et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1985, 82: 7870-3; de Wet et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1987, 7: 725-37]. Oxidation of D-luciferin is accompanied by the release of yellow-green light having an emission maximum at 560 nm. The same D-luciferin is oxidized by other insect luciferases: as of today, more than 30 enzymes from various insect species of Phengodidae, Elateridae and Lampyridae families, emitting light with emission maxima in the range of 536 to 630 nm have been cloned. Also, mutant forms of insect luciferases have been described and synthetic D-luciferin analogs have been produced making it possible to obtain luciferin-luciferase pairs having different properties [Thorne et al., Chem Biol., 2010, 17: 646-57. Despite a wide variety of analogs, D-luciferin remains the most common substrate for in vivo bioluminescence due to high quantum efficiency of the reaction (0.88+−0.25 [Seliger and McElroy, Arch Biochem Biophys, 1960, 88: 136-141]). A significant difficulty in using this system is a relatively large molecular weight of luciferase from Photinus pyralis (61 kDa). This fact makes it unsuitable for creating several chimeric proteins (for example, for investigation of viruses) because of low stability of the increased genome thereof [Tran et al., J Virol, 2013, 87: 13321-13329; Tran et al., Viruses, 2015, 7: 5319-5327]. Another difficulty is a need to obtain D-luciferin in enantiomerically pure form since an isomer thereof, L-luciferin, is a strong competitive inhibitor of the reaction [Lembert, Biochem J, 1996, 317: 273-277]. The fact that luciferase from Photinus pyralis is not secreted places additional limitations upon quantifying the in vivo bioluminescent signal.
      Also, a large group of luciferases and photoproteins catalyzing the oxidation of coelenterazine has been described. For example, coelenterazine-dependent bioluminescent systems in Renilla, Gaussia and Metridia longa have been described [O. Shimomura, Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd, Singapore, 2006, 470 p.] and are widely used. Mutant forms of coelenterazine-dependent luciferases and photoproteins and synthetic analogs of coelenterazine have also been obtained [Kaskova et al., Chem Soc Rev., 2016, 45: 6048-6077]. Despite the plurality of advantages of the coelenterazine system, i. e. the ability to be secreted, small size and a wide variety of available luciferases, the main limitations for application thereof are primarily related to the location of a bioluminescence emission maximum in the blue region; as a result, the blue light is mostly absorbed in vivo by the tissues of interest. Besides, bioluminescence substrate itself can emit light during non-enzymatic oxidation by ambient oxygen (presence of superoxide anions and peroxynitrite ions in tissues enhances the process) resulting in noise in the measured bioluminescent signal.
      Another example of a bioluminescent system related to marine bacteria has been described. This system is significantly different from other bioluminescent systems. Bacterial luciferin (myristic aldehyde) is oxidized during the reaction but is not a bioluminescence emitter [O. Shimomura, Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd, Singapore, 2006? 470 p.]. In addition to luciferin, the key components of the luminescent reaction are NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and FMN-H 2 (flavin mononucleotide), the oxidized derivative of which acts as the true light source. Bioluminescent systems of marine bacteria are of limited use since they are applicable only for prokaryotic expression systems.
      Bioluminescent system of the ostracod Cypridina which is characterized by highly reactive luciferin and highly stable luciferase are also known. [Shimomura et al., Science, 1969, 164: 1299-300]. One of the main disadvantages of this bioluminescent system is extremely low stability of Cypridina luciferin on air, especially in the presence of impurities. The bioluminescence maximum of luciferin falls in the range of 448-463 nm (depending on the ionic strength of a solution). This fact makes this system unsuitable for in vivo application in unaltered form in deep tissues.
      Bioluminescent systems of dinoflagellates and euphausiids are also known. As of today, the genes coding three luciferases of this group have been cloned [O. Shimomura, Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd, Singapore, 2006]. A significant disadvantage of these systems is the lack of knowledge thereof: full luciferase sequences have not been identified yet, and the range of application of the system have not been determined. As of today, knowledge associated with the bioluminescence mechanism of dinoflagellates and euphausiids is fragmentary.
      Despite the plurality of bioluminescent systems used today, there is still a need for more luciferin-luciferase pairs possessing new properties. In particular, ATP- and NAD(P)H-independent luciferases capable of oxidizing water-soluble cell-permeant luciferins may be advantageous.
      In this respect, fungal luciferases are of great interest. Fungal bioluminescence is well-known. Moreover, it was referred to in Aristotle's tractates. However, the fungal bioluminescent systems remain poorly known. In 1959, Airth and McElroy showed that the fungal bioluminescent system comprises at least a heat-sensitive component, i. e. luciferase, and a heat-insensitive component, i. e. luciferin, and NAD(P)H [Airth and McElroy, Journal of Bacteriology, 1959, 77: 249-50]. In 2015, Purtov et al. detected fungal luciferin: it was a membrane-permeant molecule—3-hydroxyhispidin [Purtov et al., Angewandte Chemie, 2015, 54: 8124-28]. However, no fungal luciferases were cloned.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES

0002684719,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Cotton is an important cash crop in China, and cotton textiles occupy a pivotal position in China's export trade. Verticillium wilt is a most important disease of cotton, with a perennial incidence area of more than three to four million hm 2 in China, accounting for more than 70% of an entire cotton field area. This generally causes a cut of 20%-30%, and 60%-70% in heavily infected field, or even failure of the crop. An annual loss of cotton caused by Verticillium wilt reaches one million tons, and the quality of cotton fibers severely declines after a disease. At present, China's large-scale planted Gossypium hirsutum is difficult to achieve a high level of Verticillium wilt resistance. Gossypium barbadense, although being resistant to Verticillium wilt, cannot be planted in large areas due to low yield, susceptibility to Fusarium wilt, requirement for high accumulated temperature, etc. Since 1950, China's cotton breeders have been trying to incorporate disease resistance genes of Gossypium barbadense into Gossypium hirsutum by crossbreeding, so as to cultivate varieties with high resistance to Verticillium wilt and high yield, but all failed. Liu Haiyang et al. (2012) reported that, among 120 varieties in a main cotton planting area and regional trials, only one was between Verticillium wilt resistance and disease resistance, and the rest were resistant or susceptible varieties. Therefore, it is necessary to clone a gene associated with disease resistance in Gossypium barbadense, and introduce such a gene into high-yield Gossypium hirsutum by a genetically modified approach, to cultivate high-yield and Verticillium dahliae resistant varieties. This will be of significant importance in increasing cotton production, improving farmers' income, ensuring safety of cotton in China, and promoting development of national economy.
      Main pests and diseases of cotton include Fusarium wilt, Verticillium wilt, and Helicoverpa armigera. Verticillium wilt has not only a large incidence area, but also an increasing serious illness area. Strong pathogenic defoliating strains especially cause devastating damages, and 71.9% of defoliating strains is strong pathogenic bacteria. Since 1993, Verticillium wilt has frequently broken out in China. In 2003, large-scale outbreak of Verticillium wilt occurred in China's Yellow River, Yangtze River, and western Gossypium hirsutum areas at the same time. In 2006, Verticillium wilt attacked Jiluyu (China's Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces) severely, and more than 70% of a total planting area of cotton in these provinces were caught by serious disease. Currently, Xinjiang Autonomous Region has become a main producing area of cotton in China, and with popularization of drip irrigation under film, incidences of Verticillium wilt are also rapidly increasing.
      The occurrence of Verticillium wilt not only reduces lint production, but also seriously affects cotton quality. Verticillium wilt is usually divided into five grads from Grade 0 to Grade IV, and to measure disease resistance of a variety, a disease index is generally used. Regarding Verticillium wilt, disease indexes at 0-10, 11-20, 21-35, and higher than 35 indicate high resistance, disease resistance, tolerance to disease, and susceptibility to disease, respectively. After the cotton is infected, the number of boll setting in individual plant will be significantly reduced due to lack of nutrient supply. When the disease becomes serious, the number of boll setting in individual plant is less than 50% of that on normal conditions (when the number of boll setting in individual plant is about 18). Such being the case, even if the bolls do not fall off, the weight per cotton boll will be significantly reduced. It has been estimated that, the outbreak of Verticillium wilt in 2003 reduced lint production by 230 million kilograms, which directly caused economic losses of about RMB 3 billion. After that, Verticillium wilt caused more than RMB 1 billion of economic losses each year in China. After being infected, high resistant cotton will suffer significantly deteriorated fiber quality, including reduced general fineness by 20%, decreased strength by 22%, and reduced length by 2 mm. Verticillium wilt is caused by Verticillium dahlia in China. Once being in the soil, such bacteria will survive more than 20 years. As a result, Verticillium wilt has been known as cotton “cancer.” Verticillium wilt has attracted attention in China in research and control thereof since 1972, but has not yet been effectively controlled so far. Currently, the control of Verticillium wilt substantially includes chemical control, biological control, agricultural control, and disease-resistant breeding control. Chemical control has a certain control effect, but also brings about serious pollution to the environment. Biological control, using Trchoderma spp., produces a certain control effect, the biocontrol effects of which are, however, largely subject to environmental conditions. And long rotation of agricultural control is difficult to achieve in China. Disease-resistant breeding control, which aims to cultivate disease-resistant varieties, is a most cost-effective approach. Therefore, a most cost-effective solution to a resistant problem of cotton to Verticillium wilt is to clone a gene associated with Verticillium wilt resistance, cultivate new varieties of cotton by genetically modified approaches, and enhance resistance to Verticillium wilt.
      The use of a genetically modified approach to create new germplasm resources and cultivate disease-resistant varieties is a most cost-effective approach to control Verticillium wilt. Gossypium barbadense L., which is highly resistant to Verticillium wilt, although containing a gene associated with disease resistance, cannot be planted in a large area due to its low yield. And its resistance gene is difficult to integrate into a genome of Gossypium hirsutum by crossbreeding. Therefore, a best solution is to clone a gene associated with Verticillium wilt resistance in Gossypium barbadense, transform Gossypium hirsutum L., and cultivate varieties with high yield and high-resistance to Verticillium wilt. Modern molecular genetics facilitates cloning of genes associated with disease resistance. In recent years, researchers at home and abroad have made specific progress in cloning Verticillium wilt resistance gene (R gene), transforming broad-spectrum antimicrobial gene, and transforming a Gossypium barbadense gene associated with disease resistance. The above study broadens gene sources resistant to Verticillium wilt, and lays the foundation for cultivation of genetically modified varieties resistant to Verticillium wilt. In addition, in recent years, with the in-depth study of the interaction mechanism between plants and pathogens, it has been found that PTI (PAMP-triggered immunity, a plant immune response induced by extracellular pathogenic factor) and ETI (effector-triggered immunity, an immune response induced by intracellular effector factor) are two modes of triggering immunity of plants. In terms of researches in Verticillium wilt, Dutch scientists have first proved that a PTI mechanism can be applied to plant resistance to Verticillium dahliae, while the mechanism of intracellular resistance to Verticillium wilt has not been reported so far.

      In the above biomaterial, the nucleic acid molecule of B1) is a gene represented by:
      1) a cDNA or DNA molecule with a nucleotide sequence as shown in nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the Sequence Listing;
      2) a cDNA or DNA molecule that exhibits 75% or more identity to the nucleotide sequence defined in 1) and encodes the VdAl;

      The nucleic acid molecule may be DNA, such as cDNA, genomic DNA, and recombinant DNA. Or alternatively, the nucleic acid molecule may also be RNA, such as mRNA and hnRNA.
      SEQ ID NO: 2 consists of 864 nucleotides encoding the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.

When the computer software is used, identity between two or more sequences can be expressed as a percentage (%), which can be used to evaluate identity between relevant sequences.
      In the above biomaterial, the stringent conditions include hybridization at 68° C. in a 2×SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS, followed by washing the membrane twice for 5 min each, and then hybridization at 68° C. in a 0.5×SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS, followed by washing the membrane twice for 15 min each; or alternatively hybridization at 65° C. in a 0.1×SSPE (or 0.1×SSC) buffer with 0.1% SDS, followed by washing the membrane.
      The above 75% or more identity can be 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or more identity.
      In the above biomaterial, the expression cassette (VdAL gene expression cassette) of B2) comprising the nucleic acid molecule encoding the VdAL refers to a DNA capable of expressing the VdAL in a host cell. The DNA may include not only a promoter that initiates the transcription of VdAL gene, but may also include a terminator that terminates the transcription of VdAL gene. The expression cassette may further comprise an enhancer sequence. Promoters that can be used in the present invention include, but are not limited to, constitutive promoters, tissues, organs, and development-specific promoters, and inducible promoters. Examples of the promoters include, but are not limited to, constitutive promoter 35S of cauliflower mosaic virus, trauma-induced promoters from tomatoes, leucine aminopeptidase (“LAP,” Chao et al. (1999) Plant Physiol 120: 979-992); chemically induced promoters from tobacco, pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) (induced by salicylic acid and BTH (benzothiadiazole-7-thiohydroxy acid S-methyl ester)); tomato protease inhibitor II (PIN2) promoter or LAP promoter (all can be induced with methyl jasmonate); heat shock promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,187,267); tetracycline-inducible promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 5,057,422); seed-specific promoters, such as millet seed-specific promoter pF128 (CN 101063139B (with a filing number of CN 200710099169.7), seed storage protein-specific promoters (e.g., cabbage, napin, oleosin, and soybean beta conglycin promoters (Beachy et al. (1985) EMBO J. 4: 3047-3053)). They can be used alone or in combination with other plant promoters. All references cited are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Suitable transcription terminators include, but are not limited to, Agrobacterium nopaline synthetase terminator (NOS terminator), cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S terminator, tml terminator, pea rbcS E9 terminator, and nopaline and octopine synthase terminator (see, e.g., Odell et al. (I 958) Nature, 313: 810; Rosenberg et al. (1987) Gene, 56: 125; Guerineau et al. (1991) Mol. Gen. Genet, 262: 141; Proudfoot (1991) Cell, 64: 671; Sanfacon et al. Genes Dev., 5: 141; Mogen et al. (1990) Plant Cell, 2: 1261; Munroe et al. (1990) Gene, 91: 151; Ballad et al. Nucleic Acids Res., 17: 7891; and Joshi et al. (1987) Nucleic Acid Res., 15: 9627).
      An existing expression vector can be used to construct the recombinant vector containing the expression cassette of VdAL gene. The plant expression vector can be binary Agrobacterium tumefaciens vectors, a vector that can be used for microprojectile bombardment in plant, and the like, such as pAHC25, pBin438, pCAMBIA1302, pCAMBIA2301, pCAMBIA1301, pCAMBIA1300, pBI121, pCAMBIA1391-Xa, and pCAMBIA1391-Xb (CAMBIA). The plant expression vector may also comprise a 3′-untranslated region of a foreign gene, i.e., a polyadenylation signal and any other DNA fragment involved in mRNA processing or gene expression may be comprised. The polyadenylation signal can lead polyadenylation to a 3′-end of an mRNA precursor. For example, plasmid gene induced by Agrobacterium crown gall (Ti) (such as nopaline synthase gene Nos), and 3′-end transcribed, untranslated regions of the plant gene (such as soy storage protein gene) all have a similar function. When the gene of the present invention is used to construct a plant expression vector, enhancers, including translation enhancers or transcriptional enhancers, may also be used. Enhancer regions, which may be ATG initiation codon, contiguous region initiation codon, or the like, must be identical to a reading frame of the encoding sequence, so as to ensure correct translation of an entire sequence. The translation control signal and the initiation codon, which have a wide variety of sources, may be either natural or synthetic. The translation initiation region may be derived from a transcription initiation region or a structural gene. In order to facilitate identification and screening of the genetically modified plant cells or plants, a plant expression vector used can be processed through, e.g., addition of a gene that can be expressed in a plant and can encode an enzyme producing a color or synthetise a luminescent compound (such as a GUS gene and a luciferase gene), an antibiotic marker gene (such as a nptII gene that confers resistance to kanamycin and related antibiotics, a bar gene that confers resistance to herbicide phosphinothricin, a hph gene that confers resistance to antibiotic hygromycin, a dhfr gene that confers resistance to methotrexate, and an EPSPS gene that confers resistance to glyphosate), an anti-chemical reagent marker gene (such as a herbicide-resistant gene), or a mannose-6-phosphate isomerase gene that provides the ability of mannose metabolism. For safety of the genetically modified plants, they can be transformed directly by adversity screening without any selective marker gene.
      In the above biomaterial, the vector may be a plasmid, cosmid, phage, or viral vector.
      In the above biomaterial, the microorganism may be yeast, bacteria, algae, or fungi, such as Agrobacterium.
      In the above biomaterial, the genetically modified plant organ may be a seed of a genetically modified plant. The genetically modified plant (e.g., maize) may include a seed, a calli, an intact plant, and a cell. The genetically modified maize may include a seed, a calli, an intact plant, and a cell.
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the gene encoding the VdAL (i.e., the DNA molecule represented by nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2) is introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 via a recombinant vector containing an expression cassette of the gene encoding the VdAL. The recombinant vector is recombinant vector pSPT01-VdAL obtained by replacement of a fragment between recognition sites of Sal I and Kpn I in pSPT01 with the DNA molecule shown by the nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2. pSPT01-VdAL expresses the VdAL protein shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.
      In another embodiment of the present invention, the gene encoding the VdAL (i.e., the DNA molecule represented by nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2) is introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 via a recombinant vector containing an expression cassette of the gene encoding the VdAL. The recombinant vector is recombinant vector pCAMBIA1300-Super-VdAL obtained by replacement of a fragment between recognition sites of Pst I and Kpn I in pCAMBIA1300-Super with the DNA molecule shown by the nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2. pCAMBIA1300-Super-VdAL expresses the VdAL protein shown in SEQ ID NO: 1.
      In order to solve the above technical problem, the present invention further provides use of the VdAL or the biomaterial in:
      a) regulation of plant disease resistance; or
      b) cultivation of a disease-resistant genetically modified plant.
      In the above use, the plant may be a dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plant.
      In the above use, the disease resistance may be Verticillium wilt resistance.
      In the above use, the plant may be a dicotyledonous plant or a monocotyledonous plant; and the disease resistance may be Verticillium wilt resistance.
      In the above use, the dicotyledonous plant may be the plant of Gossypium. The plant of Gossypium may be cotton. The cotton may be specifically sGK9708-41.
      In order to solve the above technical problem, the present invention further provides a method for cultivating a disease-resistant genetically modified plant.
      The method for cultivating a disease-resistant genetically modified plant provided in the present invention comprises a step of introducing a gene encoding the VdAL into a recipient plant, to obtain the disease-resistant genetically modified plant having higher disease resistance than the recipient plant.
      In the above method, the gene encoding the VdAL may be a DNA molecule with an encoding sequence as shown in nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the sequence listing.
      In the above method, the plant may be a dicotyledonous plant and/or a monocotyledonous plant.
      In the above method, the disease resistance may be Verticillium wilt resistance.
      In the above method, the gene encoding the VdAL may be a DNA molecule with an encoding sequence as shown in nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the Sequence Listing; and the plant may be a dicotyledonous plant and/or a monocotyledonous plant.
      In the above method, the gene encoding the VdAL may be a DNA molecule with an encoding sequence as shown in nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the Sequence Listing; and the disease resistance may be Verticillium wilt resistance.
      In the above method, the plant may be a dicotyledonous plant and/or a monocotyledonous plant; and the disease resistance may be Verticillium wilt resistance.
      In the above method, the gene encoding the VdAL may be a DNA molecule with an encoding sequence as shown in nucleotides 1-792 of SEQ ID NO: 2 in the Sequence Listing; the plant may be a dicotyledonous plant and/or a monocotyledonous plant; and the disease resistance may be Verticillium wilt resistance.
      In the above method, the gene encoding the VdAL may also be a DNA molecule with an encoding sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 in the Sequence Listing.
      In the above method, the dicotyledonous plant may be the plant of Gossypium. The plant of Gossypium may be cotton. The cotton may be specifically sGK9708-41.
      In an embodiment of the present invention, the gene encoding the VdAL (i.e., the DNA molecule shown in SEQ ID NO: 2) is introduced into a target plant via a VdAL gene recombinant expression vector containing a VdAL gene expression cassette.
      In the above method, the VdAL gene may be first modified as follows and then introduced into a recipient seed plant, so as to achieve a better expression effect.
      At the outset, modification and optimization can be performed according to actual requirements, so as to enable efficient expression of the gene. For example, depending on a preferred codon of the recipient plant, the codon of the VdAL gene of the present invention may be altered while the amino acid sequence thereof is maintained, so as to conform to preference of the plant. In an optimization procedure, it is desirable to maintain a certain GC content in an optimized encoding sequence, so as to best achieve a high level expression of an introduced gene in the plant, wherein the GC content may be 35%, more than 45%, more than 50%, or more than about 60%.
      Besides, a gene sequence adjacent to a start-methionine can be modified, to enable effective starting of translation. For example, an effective sequence known in the plant can be used for the modification.
      Moreover, ligation to expression promoters of various plants can be performed to facilitate expression of the VdAL gene in plants. The promoters may include constitutive, inducible, timing regulation, developmental regulation, chemical regulation, tissue optimization, and tissue-specific promoters. Selection of a promoter varies with requirements in expression time and space, and also depends on a target species. For example, a specific expression promoter of a tissue or organ depends on what development period a receptor is required. Although it has been proved that many promoters derived from dicotyledonous plants are functional in monocotyledonous plants, and vice versa, it is desirable to select dicotyledon promoters for expression in dicotyledonous plants, and monocotyledon promoters for expression in monocotyledonous plants.
      In addition, ligation to a suitable transcription terminator can also be performed to improve the expression efficiency of the gene of the present invention, such as tml derived from CaMV and E9 derived from rbcS. Any available terminator known to function in a plant may be ligated to the gene of the present invention.
      Furthermore, an enhancer sequence, such as an intron sequence (e.g., from Adhl or bronzel) and a viral leader sequence (e.g., from TMV, MCMV, or AMV) can be introduced.
      The recombinant expression vector having VdAL gene can be introduced into a plant cell by a conventional biotechnological means such as Ti plasmid, plant virus vector, direct DNA conversion, microinjection, and electroporation (Weissbach, 1998, “Method for Plant Molecular Biology VIII,” Academy Press, New York, pp. 411-463; Geiserson and Corey, 1998, Plant Molecular Biology (2nd Edition)).
      In the above method, the genetically modified plant is understood to include not only a first-generation genetically modified plant obtained by conversion of a target plant by the VdAL gene, but also a progeny thereof. Regarding a genetically modified plant, a gene can be propagated in the species of the genetically modified plant, and can also be transferred into other varieties of the same species, especially commercial varieties, through a conventional breeding technical means. The genetically modified plant can be a seed, a callus, an intact plant, or a cell.
      In order to solve the above technical problem, the present invention further provides a product for regulation of plant disease resistance.
      The product for regulation of plant disease resistance provided in the present invention comprises the VdAL or the biomaterial.
      An active ingredient of the product for regulation of plant disease resistance may be the VdAL or the biomaterial.
      The product for regulation of plant disease resistance can be prepared by the steps of:
      cultivating the recombinant microorganism, to express the encoding gene and obtain a recombinant microbial culture expressing the VdAL; and
      breaking a thallus in the microbial culture, to obtain a biological agent.
      In order to solve the above technical problem, the present invention further provides use of the product in regulation of plant disease resistance.
      In the above use, the plant is a dicotyledonous plant and/or monocotyledonous plant. The dicotyledonous plant may be the plant of Gossypium. The plant of Gossypium may be cotton. The cotton may be specifically sGK9708-41.
      In the present invention, Verticillium wilt may be a disease caused by strain V 991.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002609645,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Infectious diseases are still a major thread of mankind. One way for preventing or treating infectious diseases is the artificial induction of an immune response by vaccination which is the administration of antigenic material to an individual such that an adaptive immune response against the respective antigen is developed. The antigenic material may be pathogens (e.g. microorganisms or viruses) which are structurally intact but inactivated (i.e. non-infective) or which are attenuated (i.e. with reduced infectivity), or purified components of the pathogen that have been found to be highly immunogenic. Another approach for inducing an immune response against a pathogen is the provision of expression systems comprising one or more vector encoding immunogenic proteins or peptides of the pathogen. Such vector may be in the form of naked plasmid DNA, or the immunogenic proteins or peptides are delivered by using viral vectors, for example on the basis of modified vaccinia viruses (e.g. Modified Vaccinia Ankara; MVA) or adenoviral vectors. Such expression systems have the advantage of comprising well-characterized components having a low sensitivity against environmental conditions.
      It is a particular aim when developing vector based expression systems that the application of these expression systems to a patient elicits an immune response which is protective against the infection by the respective pathogen. However, although inducing an immunogenic response against the pathogen, some expression systems are not able to elicit an immune response which is strong enough to fully protect against infections by the pathogen. Accordingly, there is still a need for expressions systems which are capable of inducing a protective immune response against a pathogen, e.g. an infectious agent like a virus.
      Viruses
      Viruses are a group of pathogens/infectious agents which have no own metabolism and can be considered as obligatory endoparasites of the respective host cells using at least parts of host's cell facilities for conducting viral protein expression and virus replication. Viruses can be classified on the basis of the type (DNA/RNA), the strandedness (single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds)), the sense (negative sense or positive sense) of the nucleic acid constituting their genome and their replication (Baltimore classification). Accordingly, viruses are generally classified in DNA and RNA viruses. Viruses can be further classified into single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) DNA or RNA viruses, which genome is a single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acid. Some viruses have a genome which is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded (e.g. hepadnaviruses). The orientation or “sense” of the genome and/or in the manufacturing of medicament for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of a pathogen and/or for use in methods of prophylaxis or treatment of a pathogen, wherein the pathogen plays an important role for the viral life cycle of viruses, in particular in the life cycle of ssRNA viruses or ssDNA viruses. A positive sense ssRNA (+) genome has the same orientation as a cellular mRNA and can be directly translated into viral proteins. In the life cycle of viruses having a negative sense single-stranded RNA genome (ssRNA (−)), it is necessary that the genomic sequences are transcribed into positive sense mRNA which can be translated into viral proteins by the host cell. A single-stranded genome that contains both positive-sense and negative-sense is called “ambisense” (e.g. ssRNA (+/−), ssDNA(+/−)).
      Although the genome of viruses may be quite large (e.g. in the case of DNA viruses), in particular small RNA viruses have evolutionary developed strategies for expressing their gene products (e.g. proteins and peptides) in a very efficient manner. One of these strategies is the expression of one or more polyprotein encoded by the viral genome, which is co- or posttranslationally processed into single proteins and/or peptides. This strategy is adapted, for example, by some double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses or single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses having a positive sense genome. “Enveloped viruses”, such as orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, retroviruses, flaviviruses, rhabdoviruses and alphaviruses, are surrounded by a lipid bilayer originating from the host plasma membrane (1).
      Attachment glycoproteins are found in all enveloped viruses and mediate the initial interaction between the viral envelope and the plasma membrane of the host cell via their binding to carbohydrate moieties or cell adhesion domains of proteins or other molecules on the plasma membrane of the host cell. Thereby, attachment glycoproteins bridge the gap between the virus and the membrane of the host cell. Attachment glycoproteins designated as “H” possess hemagglutinin activity, glycoproteins designated as “HN possesses hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities. Attachment glycoproteins are designated as “G” when they have neither haemagglutination nor neuraminidase activity.
      Paramyxoviruses
      Paramyxoviruses are a family of animal viruses which comprises a single stranded non-segmented negative-sense RNA. Paramyxoviruses are responsible for a number of animal and human diseases. The RNA genome of paramyxoviruses is 15-19 kilo bases (kb) in length and encodes 6-10 genes. Each gene contains transcription start/stop signals at the beginning and end, which are transcribed as part of the gene. The gene sequence is conserved across the paramyxoviruses due to a phenomenon known as transcriptional polarity in which genes closest to the 3′ end of the genome are transcribed in greater abundance than those towards the 5′ end. After each gene is transcribed, the RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase pauses to release the new mRNA when it encounters an intergenic sequence. When the RNA polymerase is paused, there is a chance that it will dissociate from the RNA genome. If it dissociates, it must reenter the genome at the leader sequence, rather than continuing to transcribe the length of the genome. As a result, the further downstream genes are from the leader sequence, the less they will be transcribed by the RNA polymerase. The genes of paramyxoviruses are arranged in relative order of protein needed for successful infection. The conserved gene sequence is Nucleocapsid—Phosphoprotein—Matrix—Fusion—Attachment—Large (polymerase).
      Many Paramyxovirus genomes follow the so-called “Rule of Six”. According to this rule, the total length of the genome is almost always a multiple of six. However, the members of the sub-family Pneumovirinae comprising the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) do not follow this rule.
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
      The enveloped virus designated as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in infants and children worldwide (2). In the United States, it is estimated that 70,000-126,000 infants are hospitalized annually with RSV pneumonia or bronchiolitis and that the rate of hospitalization for bronchiolitis has increased since 1980 (3). Children are infected by 2 years of age and the WHO has estimated that RSV causes disease in approximately 64 million children each year and 160,000 deaths. In industrialised countries, RSV is responsible for at least 50% of hospitalisations for respiratory disease in children, and up to 6% of all RSV infections in children result in hospitalisation (4). RSV infection does not provoke lasting immunity, so that human hosts experience lifelong cycles of infection and re-infection. Although it is traditionally regarded as a pediatric pathogen, RSV also causes severe disease in the elderly and immuno-compromised individuals (5). The burden of RSV disease in the elderly is comparable to that of seasonal influenza and the economic impact of RSV-related disease in adults is estimated to be greater than that of influenza in relation to numbers of days lost from work (6, 7). Monoclonal antibody prophylaxis is effective in reducing RSV hospitalisations by 50% in infants at high risk of severe disease (8). However, there is currently no effective RSV vaccine or anti-viral therapy.
      The disastrous effect of a formalin-inactivated (FI) RSV vaccine in infants in the 1960s has hampered vaccine development. The vaccine failed to protect against RSV infection and induced exacerbated respiratory disease (9) which has been attributed to induction of high titre, poorly neutralising, low affinity antibodies, lack of CD8+ T cell priming and induction of a Th2-biased immune response (10, 11, and 12). There is evidence that RSV impairs the induction of an adequate adaptive T cell immune response (13).
      There is, therefore, a clear need for an effective vaccine not only to protect infants, but also to boost immunity in the elderly and to reduce the circulation of RSV in siblings and adults, who are the main source of RSV infection for infants. A RSV vaccine capable of inducing neutralizing antibody response and potent and broad T cell response for priming a T cell responses in individuals who have not yet been infected with RSV (infants) or for boosting a pre-existing T cell response in individuals who need to ‘reset’ the memory response to higher levels (elderly) is especially desirable.
      Orthomyxoviruses
      Orthomyxoviruses are a family of RNA viruses that includes five genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Isavirus and Thogotovirus. A sixth genus has recently been described. The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates, including birds, humans, and other mammals. The three genera of influenza virus have antigenic differences in their nucleoprotein and matrix protein. Influenzavirus A infects humans, other mammals, and birds, and causes all influenza pandemics. Influenzavirus B infects humans and seals. Influenzavirus C infects humans and pigs.
      Viruses of the Orthomyxovirus family contain 6 to 8 segments of linear negative-sense single stranded RNA. The total genome length is 12000-15000 nucleotides (nt). The largest segment 2300-2500 nt; of second largest 2300-2500 nt; of third 2200-2300 nt; of fourth 1700-1800 nt; of fifth 1500-1600 nt; of sixth 1400-1500 nt; of seventh 1000-1100 nt; of eighth 800-900 nt. Genome sequence has terminal repeated sequences; repeated at both ends. Terminal repeats at the 5′-end are 12-13 nucleotides long. The nucleotide sequences of 3′-terminus are identical the same in genera of same family; most on RNA (segments), or on all RNA species. Terminal repeats at the 3′-end 9-11 nucleotides long.
      Influenza virus is one of the most important respiratory pathogens. In the US alone, influenza infection is responsible for 20,000-40,000 deaths and over 100,000 hospitalizations annually (1). Infants, the elderly, and individuals with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at great risk of serious complications following flu infection.
      Immunization proves to be the most effective measure in preventing the disease. One of the common features shared by all current influenza vaccines consists in targeting primarily the induction of neutralizing antibodies directed against the major viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002681928,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      In a typical analog telephone system used in homes and small businesses, extension phones are connected in parallel across the telephone line conductors. In such a typical system, as shown in FIG. 1, a telephone line 110 comprising a wire pair extends from a public switched telephone network (PSTN) to several conventional analog telephones 121, 122 and 123 within the premises 102 of a home or business. The telephones 121-123 are connected in parallel across the wire pair of the telephone line 110. Power for the analog telephones is supplied by the telephone company on the telephone line from an uninterruptable power source (UPS) and the analog telephones require no other power source. Each of the telephones 121-123 can be used to make a telephone call or receive a telephone call. The system is very reliable and can and does provide uninterrupted telephone service in all but the worst national disasters. The telephone system will remain fully operative in most instances when electric power to the business or home is interrupted. However, the analog telephones 121-123 cannot be used to make calls to each other, cannot be used as an intercom system, and cannot transfer calls or hold calls or perform other functions provided by most modern telephone systems.
      To increase the functionality of their telephone system, many small businesses and some private homes employ a private branch exchange (PBX) in a system, such as that shown in FIG. 2. In the system of FIG. 2, one or more telephone lines 101 are terminated in a PBX server 210. The PBX server 210 is separately connected by connections 221, 222 and 223 to telephones 231, 232 and 233, respectively. The connections 221, 222 and 223 can be analog or digital, but the connections are point to point, each allowing communication only between the PBX and the corresponding telephone. The configuration of FIG. 2 allows for rich functionality because the PBX server 210 can route incoming calls to any one of the telephones 231-233 as well as let the telephones 231-233 make calls to each other, provide a hold function, provide a forwarding function, provide voice mail and many other modem telephone functions. This configuration, however, has a disadvantage in that the PBX server 210 must be powered from an external power source and if power fails or if the PBX server 210 fails, the phone service for all of the phones is interrupted.
      Another typical PBX system is shown in FIG. 3. In this system, one or more telephone lines 101 is terminated in a PBX server connected to telephones 321, 322 and 323 over a local area network (LAN) 320, which may be a coax cable which is connected in parallel to the telephones 321, 322 and 323. Alternatively, instead of the coax cable, the LAN network may be twisted pairs, such as an Ethernet 10-base T system. In any case, the telephones 321, 322 and 323 are logically connected in parallel and can receive all data and transmit to all other end points on the LAN including transmissions via logically transparent repeaters, hubs, switches and routers. Like the PBX arrangement of FIG. 2, the LAN system in FIG. 3 allows a high degree of functionality and, in addition, provides the capability of having computers connected as end points and permits computers to be used as telephones, telecopiers and answering devices. However, like the PBX server in FIG. 2, the PBX server 310 of the system in FIG. 3 must also receive power from an external source and it is therefore suffers from the same weakness in that service to all of the telephones and other end points can be cut off in the event of power failure or failure of the PBX server.
      The above described disadvantages of the systems of FIGS. 2 and 3 are not major problems in large businesses because there, power can be made redundant with UPS devices and, typically, a professional maintenance staff is available. In such large businesses, PBX functions are seen as being indispensable and the businesses willingly trade the lower reliability of the PBX systems for the enhanced telephone systems that they receive from the PBX systems. However, typically, in small businesses and in private homes, there is no maintenance staff and an UPS is an unwanted expense. Accordingly, there is a need for small businesses and private homes for a telephone system which has the features of a PBX system but yet has the reliability of the old fashioned analog telephone system shown in FIG. 1.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The system of the present invention is implemented in a LAN telephone system in which a PBX is used to route telephone calls to or from telephones or other telephonic devices of the system. In accordance with the invention, fallback adapters are provided to automatically respond to a power failure and also automatically respond to a failure of the PBX. When a power failure occurs or a PBX failure occurs, the fallback adapters directly connect the telephones to a telephone line or telephone lines of the system to enable the telephones to be used as analog phones and make and receive calls directly without using the PBX. Power failure is detected in the fallback adapters by a relay which defaults to a position to connect the telephones directly to the telephone line. In addition, the fallback detectors are provided with controller logic which detect the presence of a ringing signal on the telephone line and the failure of the PBX to respond to the ringing signal. In addition, the fallback detectors detect the failure of the PBX to respond when a telephone is used to attempt to make an outgoing call or a call to another one of the telephones. When detecting a failure of the PBX, the control logic in a fallback detector will actuate the relay in the fallback detector to its fallback positions so as to connect the corresponding telephone directly to the telephone line and allow the telephone to make and receive telephone calls as an analog telephone. In this manner, when a power failure occurs or when the PBX fails in the LAN system, the system is switched to operate in the analog mode and telephone service is maintained even though a power failure or PBX failure has occurred.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002646139,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR), a member of the TNFR superfamily, is expressed in many components of the innate and adaptive immune system (see, e.g., Hanabuchi et al. (2006) Blood 107:3617-3623; and Nocentini and Riccardi (2005) Eur. J. Immunol. 2005. 35:1016-1022). Its membrane expression is increased following T cell activation (Hanabuchi, supra; and Nocentini and Riccardi, supra); its triggering co-activates effector T lymphocytes and modulates regulatory T cell (Treg) activity (see, e.g., McHugh, et al. (2002) Immunity 2002. 16:311-323; Shimizu, et al. (2002) Nat. Immunol. 3:135-142; Ronchetti, et al (2004) Eur. J. Immunol. 34:613-622; and Tone, et al. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:15059-15064.
      GITR is activated by GITR ligand (GITRL), which is mainly expressed on APC and has been suggested to deliver signals by its cytoplasmic domain, although further studies are necessary to define the biochemical signaling (Nocentini, supra; Ronchetti, supra; Suvas, et al. (2005) J. Virol. 79:11935-11942; and Shin, et al. (2002) Cytokine 19:187-192).
      GITR activation increases resistance to tumors and viral infections, is involved in autoimmune/inflammatory processes and regulates leukocyte extravasation (Nocentini supra; Cuzzocrea, et al. (2004) J. Leukoc. Biol. 76:933-940; Shevach et al. (2006) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 6:613-618; Cuzzocrea, et al. (2006) J. Immunol. 177:631-641; and Cuzzocrea et al. (2007) FASEB J. 21:117-129).
      The need exists for improved methods and compositions for the treatment of immune and proliferative disorders, e.g., tumors and cancers, by use of agents that modulate GITR activity. Preferably, such agonists would have a high affinity for the target molecule, and would be able to stimulate GITR signaling at relatively low doses. Preferably, such methods and compositions would be highly specific for GITR, and not interfere with the activity of other receptors. Preferably, such methods and compositions would employ agonists suitable for modification for the delivery of cytotoxic payloads to target cells, but also suitable for non-cytotoxic uses. Preferably, such methods and compositions would employ antibodies modified to limit their antigenicity when administered to a subject in need thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200800091,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      This invention relates to a polypeptide with antifungal, anti-Oomycete and plant growth promoter properties, extracted from seeds, cotyledons or plantlets of the genus Lupinus, and to its application in the control of pathogenic agents that attack plants and as a plant bio-stimulant. This polypeptide may be applied directly on plants, or the plants may be genetically modified to express the polypeptide in their tissues. In addition, due to its unusual inherent characteristics, the polypeptide may be utilized in the preparation of protein concentrates useful as supplements in the diet of man and other animals.
      The present invention also describes the nucleotide DNA sequence corresponding to the gene fragment that encodes the Lupinus polypeptide, as well as its sequence of amino acid residues, microorganisms transformed with the gene fragment that encodes the Lupinus polypeptide and methods for its application as a fungicide, insecticide, plant growth promoter or fertilizer or as a supplement in human or animal nutrition.
      It is also object of this invention the polypeptide characterized by the sequence of amino acid residues referred above, in which one or more amino acid residues are absent, have been substituted or added, or maintaining its biological activities after suffering chemical modification, such as, for example, glycosylation.
      The control of pathogenic agents constitutes a serious problem worldwide with respect to the most important crops. Pathogenic fungi are particularly important in what concerns the storage of agricultural products. Presently, control over fungal growth is generally achieved by massive applications of chemical fungicides. However, phytopharmaceutical products currently available in the market display several serious disadvantages. On one hand, they exhibit high economical and environmental costs; on the other hand, many fungal species have been developing resistance mechanisms to some top fungicides, often turning them obsolete in a couple of years after their introduction in the market.
      Even though plants do not possess an immunological system resembling that of animals, they have evolved an inherent resistance to the attack of pathogenic fungi. However, the techniques employed for plant growth, harvest and storage in modern agriculture promote very often good or optimal conditions for pathogen development.
      In addition, the number of microbial pathogens that may affect and harm plant crops is quite high. As an example, the following genera may be referred: Alternaria, Ascochyta, Botrytis, Cercospora, Colletotrichum, Diplodia, Erysiphe, Fusarium, Gaeumanomyces, Macrophomina, Nectria, Phoma, Phomopsis, Phymatotrichum, Phytophthora, Plasmopara, Puccinia, Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Uncinula, and Verticillium. The application of the fungicides currently available in the market is limited to some of these genera, and is not an effective solution in the control of plant infections.
      An alternative strategy in the fight against microbial pathogens is the identification and purification of substances of biological origin with potent antifungal activity. The identification of such compounds involves searching a variety of organisms, such as plants and microorganisms, for substances that are subsequently tested in antifungal assays and finally isolated and characterized.
      In this way, many classes of antifungal proteins have already been isolated, including chitinases, cystein-rich proteins that bind strongly to chitin, β-1,3-glucanases, permeating, thionins and lipid transfer proteins. These proteins are thought to play a fundamental role in the natural defenses of plants against the attack of pathogens.
      Several methodologies are described in the available literature on the utilization of antifungal proteins, extracted from plants or microorganisms, either for direct application over the pathogenic agents, or in transgenic plants expressing those proteins. The antifungal proteins most often utilized in these methodologies include chitinases, glucanases, osmotin-type proteins and lysozymes. Various studies have demonstrated that genetically modified plants over-expressing these proteins exhibit enhanced resistance to many pathogens (EP 0392 225).
      Modern techniques of Molecular Biology allowed the development of recombinant DNA technology and, consequently, plant transformation with genes encoding antifungal proteins. This procedure usually involves insertion of the gene encoding the protein of interest in a plant tissue, followed by regeneration of a whole plant from the genetically modified plant tissue.
      However, the activity of some of these proteins is reduced by the presence of ions, in particular potassium, sodium or calcium. For this reason, although the proteins may exhibit a potent antifungal activity in in vitro assays, they may be ineffective in vivo due to the high physiological concentrations of the ions that may naturally occur in the transformed plant tissues.
      Document “Ramos, Paula Cristina Rodrigues, et. al—“Accumulation of a lectin-like breakdown product of beta-conglutin catabolism in cotyledons of germinating Lupinus albus L. seeds” Planta (Heidelberg), vol. 203, no 1, 1997, pages 26-34” describes isolation and purification of a 20-kDa polypeptide which is an intermediate breakdown product of beta-conglutin catabolism, the vicilin-like storage protein, which interacts with a variety of glycoproteins and possesses a lectin-type activity. In Table 1 of this document, several N-terminal amino acid sequences are described including the one of the 20-kDa polypeptide isolated from L. albus seeds. However, the N-terminal sequence presented in the Table 1 of this document includes exclusively the identity of residues no. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 23. This corresponds to a total of 15 residues out of the 173 amino acid residues that compose the sequence (B) of the present invention. In fact, the N-terminal sequence of this document is not the responsible for the biological properties related to the polypeptide of the present invention. Moreover, the N-terminal sequence described in the referred document is intended to be used to construct suitable primers, which may then be utilized in molecular biology as the first step of the long and uncertain process of gene and protein sequencing, while the main purpose of the present invention is to disclose a polypeptide exhibiting several biological activities.
      The document “Database UniProt [Online] 16 Aug. 2004 (2004-08-16)—“Beta-conglutin” discloses a protein obtained from Lupinus albus, namely beta-conglutin. This protein is the major seed storage protein present in Lupinus seeds. Despite being the precursor of the polypeptide with the sequence (B), according to the present invention, these two polymers correspond to distinct molecules for a number of reasons, namely a) beta-conglutin is regarded as a protein, with a typical quaternary structure, whereas the molecule with sequence B should not be considered as a protein, but rather as a polypeptide; b) beta-conglutin, much like the vast majority of proteins, is easily destroyed by harsh conditions. On the opposite, the polypeptide of the present invention is extremely resistant to denaturation, withstanding prolonged boiling, treatment with strong acids or bases, detergents and organic solvents. In addition, it is resistant to the Sun ultraviolet radiation; c) these two molecules fulfil entirely different roles in nature—whereas beta-conglutin is a seed storage protein, the polypeptide of the present invention displays a protective role in the plant, exhibiting a potent antifungal activity and a growth promoter activity. On the other hand, whereas beta-conglutin possesses strong catalytic activities of chitosanase and chitinase, the polypeptide of the present invention exhibits catalytic activity of beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase and a low level of chitosanase activity.
      Document “Database UniProt [Online] 24 May 2005 (2005-05-24)—“Vicilin-like protein (fragment)” discloses a fragment (length: 531 amino acid residues; molecular mass: 62,032 Da) of the same protein (i.e. beta-conglutin) described in the previous document (length: 533 amino acid residues; molecular mass: 62,130 Da). Therefore, all remarks made above in what concerns this document apply equally to the document under analysis.
      In conclusion, it is becoming imperative the identification and purification of novel compounds of biological origin exhibiting anti-pathogen properties in the fight against the pathogens that affect plants. Particular importance must be given to those compounds that are effective over a wide range of pathogens and that maintain the biological activity under in vivo conditions.
      Agricultural practices have been optimized, over a long time period, to promote plant growth and development and to increase crop production. On the other hand, it is predictable that in the medium to long term, food shortage may occur in many areas of the globe. Current techniques to control plant growth under environmentally controlled conditions are expensive and require complex equipment. For these reasons, many researchers have searched for and have reported physiologically active substances, either natural or synthetic, that exhibit a boosting effect upon the growth and development of crops. However, only a few of these substances have found practical application under real, agricultural conditions. Therefore, it is also increasingly important to discover or to develop plant growth promoters that are environmentally friend and that present no toxicity to man, animals and the environment.
      Plant legumes or, more specifically, their seeds, are considered as the major source of protein worldwide for animal and human nutrition. In this respect, soybean fulfills a prominent role, not only for the high protein content and quality of its seeds, but also for their richness in oil. However, from the agricultural point of view, soybean requires fertile soils and an abundant water supply. Plants belonging to the Lupinus genus have conquered, over the last few decades, a relevant, strong and of great potential position in comparison to soybean. If, on one hand, their seeds possess protein and oil levels comparable to those of soybean, on the other, their species are well adapted to poor soils and to conditions of low water availability. For these reasons, lupins have sometimes been considered as the “poor cousins” of soybean.
      The high level of alkaloids which are toxic to animals and which are naturally present in traditional, wild-type lupin seeds have long hampered the generalized cultivation of Lupinus species and the use of their seeds for animal and human consumption. This is the main reason why lupin cultivation has lagged far behind that of soybean. In Portugal, for example, traditional consumption of lupin seeds has long been associated to beer ingestion. These seeds are first boiled in water (heating at 100° C. destroys the capacity of seeds to germinate but does not block the imbibition's process) and then immersed under running water for a few days to remove the toxic alkaloids. However, the recent application of breeding techniques allowed the development of the so called sweet lupin varieties, characterized by containing a low seed alkaloid content (<0.004% w/w), as opposed to the traditional bitter cultivars (alkaloid content>0.004% w/w). For this reason, the seeds of sweet lupin varieties may be safely utilized as human and animal feed.
      It is therefore predictable an increasing development of lupin-derived food products for both human and animal nutrition, as has happened a number of decades ago with soybean. This is particularly important in the case of lupin seed proteins, either albumins or globulins.

","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      It is expected for the present invention to solve the technical problem associated with the identification and purification of compounds of biological origin that are capable of controlling a wide range of pathogenic agents that affect plant crops and that act as plant growth promoters while maintaining their biological activities under in vivo conditions.
      The solution is based on the characterization and identification of a polypeptide present in plants belonging to the genus Lupinus, that exhibits the following unusual characteristics: (i) a potent antifungal and anti-Oomycete activity, which confers great potential as a fungicide; (ii) a strong plant growth promoter activity, particularly notorious on unhealthy or naturally weakened plants; (iii) an extreme resistance to denaturation, allowing its use under field conditions; (iv) a very high susceptibility to proteolysis, which makes it harmless to the environment and nontoxic to man and animals; and (v) a well balanced amino acid composition.
      Therefore, the first aspect of the present invention refers to the polypeptide with the sequence B (5′KIRVLER FDQRTNRLEN LQNYRIVEFQ SKPNTLILPK HSDADYVLVV LNGRATITIV NPDRRQAYNL EYGDALRIPA GSTSYILNPD DNQKLRVVKL AIPINNPGYF YDFYPSSTKD QQSYFSGFSR NTLEATFNTR YEEIQRIILG NED 3′).
      A second aspect of the present invention concerns a DNA fragment that encodes that polypeptide. The invention also regards the use of the polypeptide, or any preparation containing it, as a fungicide, insecticide, growth promoter or fertilizer, either by direct application, in recombinant form or by expression in genetically modified organisms. Finally, the invention considers the use of the polypeptide or any preparation containing it as a supplement in human or animal nutrition.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
"
200600038,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Two or three distinct phases of changes to bone mass occur over the life of an individual (see Riggs, West J. Med. 154:63-77 (1991)). The first phase occurs in both men and women and proceeds to attainment of a peak bone mass. This first phase is achieved through linear growth of the endochondral growth plates and radial growth due to a rate of periosteal apposition. The second phase begins around age 30 for trabecular bone (flat bones such as the vertebrae and pelvis) and about age 40 for cortical bone (e.g., long bones found in the limbs) and continues to old age. This phase is characterized by slow bone loss and occurs in both men and women. In women, a third phase of bone loss also occurs, most likely due to postmenopausal estrogen deficiencies. During this phase alone, women may lose an additional 10% of bone mass from the cortical bone and 25% from the trabecular compartment (see Riggs, supra).
       Loss of bone mineral content can be caused by a wide variety of conditions and may result in significant medical problems. For example, osteoporosis is a debilitating disease in humans and is characterized by marked decreases in skeletal bone mass and mineral density, structural deterioration of bone, including degradation of bone microarchitecture and corresponding increases in bone fragility, and susceptibility to fracture in afflicted individuals. Osteoporosis in humans is preceded by clinical osteopenia (bone mineral density that is greater than one standard deviation but less than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean value for young adult bone), a condition found in approximately 25 million people in the United States. Another 7-8 million patients in the United States have been diagnosed with clinical osteoporosis (defined as bone mineral content greater than 2.5 standard deviations below that of mature young adult bone). Osteoporosis is one of the most expensive diseases for the health care system, costing tens of billions of dollars annually in the United States. In addition to health care-related costs, long-term residential care, and lost working days add to the financial and social costs of this disease. Worldwide, approximately 75 million people are at risk for osteoporosis.
       The frequency of osteoporosis in the human population increases with age. Among Caucasians, osteporosis is predominant in women who, in the United States, comprise 80% of the osteoporosis patient pool. The increased fragility and susceptibility to fracture of skeletal bone in the aged is aggravated by the greater risk of accidental falls in this population. More than 1.5 million osteoporosis-related bone fractures are reported in the United States each year. Fractured hips, wrists, and vertebrae are among the most common injuries associated with osteoporosis. Hip fractures in particular are extremely uncomfortable and expensive for the patient, and for women, correlate with high rates of mortality and morbidity.
       Although osteoporosis has been regarded as an increase in the risk of fracture due to decreased bone mass, none of the presently available treatments for skeletal disorders can substantially increase the bone density of adults. A strong perception among many physicians is that drugs are needed that could increase bone density in adults, particularly in the bones of the wrist, spinal column, and hip that are at risk in osteopenia and osteoporosis.
       Current strategies for the prevention of osteoporosis may offer some benefit to individuals but cannot ensure resolution of the disease. These strategies include moderating physical activity (particularly in weight-bearing activities) with the onset of advanced age, providing adequate calcium in the diet, and avoiding consumption of products containing alcohol or tobacco. For patients presenting clinical osteopenia or osteoporosis, the prevalent current therapeutic drugs and strategies are directed to reducing further loss of bone mass by inhibiting the process of bone absorption, a natural aspect of the bone remodeling process that occurs constitutively.
       For example, estrogen is now being prescribed to retard bone loss. However, some controversy exists over whether patients gain any long-term benefit and whether estrogen has any effect at all on patients over 75 years old. Moreover, use of estrogen is believed to increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancer. Calcitonin, osteocalcin with vitamin K, or high doses of dietary calcium, with or without vitamin D, have also been suggested for postmenopausal women. High doses of calcium, however, can often have unpleasant gastrointestinal side effects, and serum and urinary calcium levels must be continuously monitored (e.g. Khosla and Rigss, Mayo Clin. Proc. 70:978-982, 1995).
       Other therapeutic approaches to osteoporosis include bisphosphonates (e.g., Fosamax™, Actonel™, Bonviva™, Zometa™, olpadronate, neridronate, skelid, bonefos), parathyroid hormone, calcilytics, calcimimetics (e.g., cinacalcet), statins, anabolic steroids, lanthanum and strontium salts, and sodium fluoride. Such therapeutics, however, are often associated with undesirable side effects (for example, calcitonin and steroids may cause nausea and provoke an immune reaction, bisphosphonates and sodium fluoride may inhibit repair of fractures, even though bone density increases modestly) that may preclude their efficacious use (see Khosla and Rigss, supra).
       No currently practiced therapeutic strategy for treating a condition associated with excessive or insufficient bone mineralization, such as osteoporosis or other disorders characterized by loss of bone mineralization, involves a drug that alters (i.e., increases or decreases in a statistically significant manner) bone mass. In particular, no current strategy therapeutically stimulates or enhances the growth of new bone mass. The present invention provides compositions and methods which can be used to increase bone mineralization, and which therefore may be used to treat a wide variety of conditions in which an increase in bone mass is desirable. The present invention also offers other related advantages.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002626512,"BACKGROUND
      The development of concentrated protein formulations comprising proteins at a concentration of greater than 100 mg/mL presents many challenges. At such high concentrations, these proteins are restricted by solubility, administration volume and manufacturing limitations, stability issues, and delivery obstacles exist. Developing formulations in which the component protein is at present in high concentration may also present aggregation problems.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002513695,"BACKGROUND
      Advanced glycation end products (AGE) are the result of nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins. They appear under stress related circumstances including in autoimmune connective tissue diseases, and may form in inflamed tissue due to the oxidation or the myeloperoxidase pathway AGE have been implicated in a number of diabetes related complications. For example, the characteristic structural changes of diabetic nephropathy, thickened glomerular basement membrane and mesangial expansion, are accompanied by accumulation of AGE, leading to glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Prolonged infusion of nondiabetic rats with AGE has led to the development of similar morphological changes and significant proteinuria. AGE inhibitors such as aminoguanidine have been shown to prevent diabetic nephropahty in diabetic animal models and were recently shown to do the same in one clinical trial on diabetic patients. Also, AGE are a well validated therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy. Extensive diabetic murine and rat studies have demonstrated the benefit of inhibiting AGE formation in treating this disease.
      Atherosclerosis is significantly accelerated in diabetic patients and is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality. Animal and human studies have suggested that AGE play a significant role in the formation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. Increased AGE accumulation in the diabetic vascular tissues has been associated with changes in endothelial cell, macrophage, and smooth muscle cell function.
      AGE interact with cell surface receptors on monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells of the microvasculature, smooth muscle cells, mesengial cells, and neurons. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface receptors. RAGE is made up of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that is involved in signaling. RAGE binds multiple ligands in addition to AGE including S100/calgranulins, amphoterin/HMGB1, and amyloid fibrils. RAGE acts through a signal cascade involving NF-kB. RAGE expression is up-regulated in the presence of RAGE ligands and is elevated in joints of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
      RAGE has a secreted isoform lacking a transmembrane domain called soluble RAGE (sRAGE). Administration of sRAGE has been shown to restore wound healing (Goova, et al. (2001) Am. J. Pathol. 159, 513-525) and suppress diabetic atherosclerosis (Park, et al. (1998) Nat Med. 4(9):1025-31). Fusion proteins consisting of a RAGE ligand binding element and an immunoglobulin element are discussed in WO 2004/016229 A2 (Wyeth, Madison, N.J.) and US Patent App. Publication 2006/10057679 A1 (O'Keefe, T. et al.).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002759602,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) are a type of targeted therapy that typically consists of an antibody armed with potent cytotoxic drugs (Chudasama et al. Nature Chemistry, 2016; Junutula and Gerber, ACS medicinal chemistry letters 2016). ADCs thus offer the prospect of selective delivery of toxic payloads to tumors while avoiding off-target toxicities that often limit or exclude the use of chemotherapies from prolonged treatment periods. As a promising therapeutic platform, there are currently at least two approved ADC products on the market (brentuximab vedotin and trastuzumab emtansine). In its exponential growth, ADCs have a significant number of therapeutic candidates undergoing clinical evaluation.
      In order for ADCs to achieve their therapeutic potentials, sophisticated conjugation technologies are required to connect the cytotoxic drugs to the antibody. Most of the current ADC candidates, including the two commercial ADCs, utilize conventional non-specific conjugation methods through random surface lysine or free cysteines of reduced four interchain disulfides. This generates highly heterogeneous ADC mixtures, which not only creates challenges of manufacturing reproducibility but also decreases therapeutic index significantly.
      To address these issues, the ADC field has been moving towards site-specific conjugation technologies, such as cysteine (Cys) based site-specific ADCs (Junutula et al., Nat Biotechnol 2008). Robust nucleophilic thiol side chains comprising engineered unpaired cysteine residues allow a rapid and simple chemical conjugation reaction to attach diverse linkers/payloads to provide homogeneous ADC products. Better defined and improved pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for these resulting ADC molecules have been reported. The site-specific platform has its own technical challenges. When produced in mammalian cells, thiol groups on the introduced cysteine residues form disulfides with free cysteines or glutathiones (GSH). These so-called Cys-capping modifications need to be removed prior to drug conjugation through a partial reduction step. Since such treatment also reduces the antibody inter-chain disulfides, those reduced antibody interchain disulfides must then be reformed through a re-oxidation process including dialyzing out reducing agents, cysteine or glutathione, and treating with oxidation reagents (Junutula et al., Nat Biotechnol 2008). This tedious reduction and reoxidation process potentially introduces disulfide shuffling and twisting on the antibody, which can adversely affect protein folding and protein quality, and also cause issues such as poorer PK for the resulting ADCs.
      To resolve this potential issue, a novel selective reduction strategy of Cys-capping using thionitrobenzoate (TNB) has been developed (see PCT/IB2016/054789, incorporated herein by reference) without affecting inter-chain disulfides of antibody. TNB-capping, a reaction product of Ellman's reagent (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate, DTNB) with free thiol group of cysteine, is a labile capping due to its weak redox potential. It has been shown that reductant tris(3-sulfonatophenyl)phosphine (TSPP) can selectively remove TNB-capping without reducing endogenous disulfides. This TNB/TSPP process followed by direct conjugation eliminates the harsh conditions of conventional reduction-reoxidation steps, keeping folding of the original antibody intact. However, more efficient methods of TNB-capping are required to optimize commercial production of ADCs.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention is based on the discovery that the capping status of cysteine residues on antibodies can be modified by optimizing parameters such as cell growth, cell density and/or cell culturing. Thus the invention relates to antibody production process in mammalian cells in which engineered unpaired cysteine residues remain uncapped with free thiol, allowing for efficient modification, typically capping with thionitrobenzoate (TNB) when various concentration of dithionitrobenzoate (DTNB) are added at different cell culture stages or cell densities.
      The invention further relates to antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) or therapeutic protein drug conjugates produced using these TNB-capped antibodies, in particular ADCs formed by the selective reduction of the TNB-capped antibodies' cysteine residues, which avoids the reduction of inter-chain disulfides and thus eliminates the need for a (re)oxidation step prior to conjugation. The invention still further relates to novel thionitrobenzoate-capped antibodies made according to the methods described herein which allow for selective reduction with TSPP or related agents for direct conjugation with improved conjugation efficiency.
      More specifically, in this invention it was demonstrated that the capping status of unpaired surface cysteines on an antibody can be improved by careful manipulation of cell growth, cell density, or cell culturing conditions. In mammalian cell culture, cysteine is a key amino acid, cysteine, and its oxidized form cystine (Ctn), in the culture medium is preferentially utilized for cell growth, presumably through amino acid transporter X c − (Sato et al., J Biol Chem 1999; figure below). The Cys-capping reaction by cysteine/cystine/glutathione outside of cells is a slow process, and consequentially unpaired surface cysteines remain uncapped with free thiols during high cell density culturing. When DTNB was added to cell culture at a particular stage, nearly homogeneous TNB-capped antibody has been generated. These findings have provided a feasible strategy to produce TNB-capped antibody in large quantity.
      Moreover, cell culture processes are typically designed to ensure that amino acids, such as cysteine and its equivalents are not limited or depleted, in order to maximize cell growth, viable cell density and titer and to prevent amino acid substitutions (i.e., amino acid misincorporation) (see U.S. Pat. No. 8,232,075 B). L-cysteine and its oxidized form, L-cystine, are considered key amino acids in mammalian cell culture as generation of cysteine from conversion of methionine is rate limiting for cell growth, cellular metabolism and productivity. However, in this invention several methods of deliberately limiting or depleting the amount of cysteine/cystine available to the cell culture were used to promote proper capping status of cysteine residues on the antibody with TNB.
      Thus, in an embodiment of the invention there is provided a process for generating cysteine-containing proteins capable of being conjugated to a chemical payload, the process comprising the steps of: (a) seeding a cell growth medium, the medium comprising one or more growth components selected from cysteine, cystine and glutathione, with cells capable of expressing cysteine-containing proteins; (b) incubating the cells to achieve a cell density sufficient to exhaust the majority of growth components present in the growth medium; and (c) further incubating the cells to express cysteine-containing proteins having one or more uncapped cysteine residues comprising a free thiol. This process may further comprise the step of: (d) introducing a predetermined capping moiety, or a precursor thereof, to the expressed cysteine-containing proteins, whereby one or more cysteines on the protein(s) is capped with the predetermined capping moiety. In this embodiment achieved cell density is typically at least about 1E6 cells/mL, and may be for example, at least about: 5E6 cells/mL, 10E6 cells/mL, 50E6 cells/mL, 100E6 cells/mL or 500E6 cells/mL, preferably above 10E6 cells/mL, more preferably above 50E6 cells/mL.
      Note that the predetermined capping moiety may be an alkylating agent, in some instances acting as chemical “handles” other than TNB or similar labile moieties useful for additional types of drug conjugation chemistry. These handles are appended to the antibody by adding novel alkylating chemical spacers into the culture medium. The alkylating chemical spacers contain chemical handles such as aldehydes, ketones, azides, and alkynes. In the case of ketones and aldehydes, these chemical handles can react with aminooxy nucleophiles or hydrazide for additional conjugation chemistry, forming oxime/hydrazone products. In the case of azides and alkynes, these chemical handles can permit cycloaddition conjugation. Additional alkylating chemical spacers includes functional domain of Biotin, which allows specific tight non-covalent interaction between Strepavidin and Biotin. See WO2017/025897 at Example 4 which discusses the chemical handle maleimido trioxa-4-formyl benzamide (MTFB), dibenzocyclooctyl-polyethylene maleimide (DBCO-PEG4-Maleimide), and Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin (MPB).
      A further embodiment of the invention includes a process for generating cysteine-containing proteins capable of being conjugated to a chemical payload, the process comprising the steps of: (a) seeding a cell growth medium, the medium comprising one or more growth components selected from cysteine, cystine and glutathione, with cells capable of expressing cysteine-containing proteins; (b) incubating the cells to express cysteine-containing proteins having one or more uncapped cysteine residues comprising a free thiol; and (c) in step (a), step (b) or both steps (a) and (b), maintaining the concentration of the one or more growth components at concentrations below 0.4 mM, below 0.3 mM, below 0.2 mM, below 0.1 mM or below 0.05 mM. This process may further comprise the step of: (d) introducing a predetermined capping moiety, or a precursor thereof, to the expressed cysteine-containing proteins, whereby one or more cysteines on the proteins are capped with the predetermined capping moiety.
      A still further embodiment includes a process for generating cysteine-containing proteins capable of being conjugated to a chemical payload, the process comprising the steps of: (a) seeding a cell growth medium, the medium comprising one or more growth components selected from cysteine, cystine and glutathione, with cells capable of expressing cysteine-containing proteins, including but not limited to where the initial concentration of the growth components is below 2 mM, below 0.4 mM, below 0.3 mM, below 0.2 mM, below 0.1 mM or below 0.05 mM, and then (b) incubating the cells to express cysteine-containing proteins having one or more uncapped cysteine residues comprising a free thiol. This process may further comprise the step of: (c) introducing a predetermined capping moiety, or a precursor thereof, to the expressed cysteine-containing proteins, whereby one or more cysteines on the proteins are capped with the predetermined capping moiety.
      Also within the present invention are embodiments where growth components are exhausted in the cell culture by deliberately limiting the cysteine and/or its alternative forms in the process. Using rational media design and stoichiometric approaches taught in U.S. Pat. No. 8,232,075 B, the required amount of cysteine/cystine needed for a particular peak cell density and amount of product produced can be calculated by the equation below (Equation 1). This equation is generic for CHO cultures and a more specific equation can be generated for a particular cell line by determining the cysteine consumption rate for that cell line in a given process.
Equation 1. Required Cysteine Concentration
      
          Required Cysteine Concentration=[( x*m)+( x*m*k)+( p*n)]* f
      x: cysteine concentration required for E6 cells/mL (0.09 mM)
      m: peak cell density (E6 cells/mL)
      k: maintenance factor (10-15%)
      p: cysteine concentration required for 1 g/L antibody (0.19 mM)
      n: final antibody concentration (1 g/L)
      f: safety factor (1.1-1.3)
After determining the require amount of cysteine for a particular cell line in a given process, the fractional cysteine limitation ratio equation can be used to determine the amount of cysteine/cystine to provide in a process to target a specific limitation ratio (Equation 2), in order to deliberately limit or deplete the cysteine/cystine in the culture. Within the present invention are embodiments where growth components are exhausted by limiting the fractional cysteine limitation ratio in the cell growth medium to less than about 1.0×. These ratios may be, for instance, about: 0.95×, 0.90×, 0.85×, 0.80×, 0.75×, 0.70×, 0.65×, 0.60×, 0.55×, 0.50×, 0.45×, 0.40×, 0.35×, 0.30×, 0.25×, 0.20×, 0.15×, 0.10× or 0.05×.
(NB)
      Of course, the cysteine-containing proteins of the invention include a wide variety of moieties, including but not limited to antibodies and fusion proteins. These may be an anti-EDB antibody and an anti-HER2 antibody including trastuzumab.
      In the processes described herein, the predetermined capping moiety may be selected from the group consisting of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), 2-mercaptopyridine, dithiodipyridine (DTDP), 4-thiobenzoic acid, 2-thiobenzoic acid, 4-thiobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-thiobenzenesulfonic acid, methyl sulfonate (Ms), p-toluenesulfonate (Ts) and trifluoromethanesulfonate (Tf); and/or the predetermined capping moiety is selected from a reactive group consisting of maleimido trioxa-4-formyl benzamide (MTFB) like molecules with an aldehyde handle or maleimido azido-lysine-like molecules with an azide handle, or dibenzocyclooctyl-polyethylene maleimide (DBCO-PEG4-Maleimide)-like molecules with an alkyne handle. Often, the predetermined capping moiety is TNB, and often the precursor is DTNB.
      Also in the processes described herein, the capped proteins are subject to further processing consisting of one or more of isolation, purification and concentration, at one or more different points in the process. Thus in certain embodiments of the invention at least 50% of the cells are separated from the expressed cysteine-containing proteins prior to introduction of the predetermined capping moiety or precursor thereof. This separation may be accomplished by centrifugation or filtration.
      The invention further provides embodiments for conjugating a TNB-capped (or otherwise capped) cysteine-containing protein, comprising the steps of: (a) reacting the TNB-capped cysteine-containing protein with a reducing agent capable of detaching the TNB-capping moieties from the protein without significantly reducing antibody inter-chain sulfur bonds; (b) filtering the reaction mixture to remove excess reducing agent, detached TNB, or both; and (c) without introducing an oxidizing agent, conjugating one or more reduced sulfur bonds on the antibody to a payload through a reactive linking moiety.
      The invention still further provides embodiments for conjugating a TNB-capped (or otherwise capped) cysteine-containing protein, comprising the steps of: (a) reacting the TNB-capped cysteine-containing protein with stoichiometric excess of reducing agent capable of detaching the TNB-capping moieties from the protein without significantly reducing antibody inter-chain sulfur bonds, optionally in the presence of salts such as sodium chloride or other salts (see Example 8); (b) filtering the reaction mixture to remove one or more of excess reducing agent, detached TNB; (c) introducing an oxidizing agent to repair reduced inter-chain sulfur bonds caused by excess reducing agent; and (d) conjugating one or more reduced sulfur bonds on the antibody to a payload through a reactive linking moiety. The stoichiometric excess is typically about 4:1 to 6:1 reducing agent to capped cysteine residue (for instance, 16:1 to 24:1 reducing agent to antibody for an antibody with four capped cysteines), and preferably about 5:1. Step (c) of this process can be performed at ambient temperatures, for instance at about 25 degrees Celsius, in order to shorten oxidation times and to avoid process temperature changes. Performance at low temperatures, for example at about 4 degrees Celsius, requires longer oxidation time, but is less sensitive to loss of yield if target oxidation time is exceeded. The above described process may further comprise a step of: (e) adding excess cysteine after step (d) to quench the reaction of the linking moiety; and (f) separating the quenched linker-payload from the conjugate. The cysteine quench allows for improved separation of linker-payload by chromatography or diafiltration. Further, in the above-described process the separation may be performed by diafiltration or column chromatography, typically hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). Use of isopropanol-containing buffers to perform the HIC purification results in increased recovery of purified conjugate.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002573894,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
      The present invention is from the field of protein purification. In particular, the invention concerns methods for increasing the filtration capacity of virus filters, by combined use of endotoxin removal and cation-exchange media in the prefiltration process.
Description of the Related Art
      Mammalian cell lines have become the primary choice for production of recombinant protein therapeutics due to their capacity for proper protein folding and post translational modification such as glycosylation (Chu and Robinson Current Opinion in Biotechnology 12:180-187, 2001). However, these cell lines are also known to contain retrovirus like particles (Lieber et al. Science 182:56-59, 1973; Lubiniecki et al. Dev Biol Stand 70:187-191, 1989) and possess the risk for potential adventitious virus contamination (Garnick, Dev Biol Stand. Basel: Karger 93:21-29, 1998). While the biopharmaceutical industry producing recombinant protein drugs has a good safety record, there have been past incidences of viral infection by blood and blood products derived from plasma (Brown, Dev. Biol. Stand. 81, 1993; Thomas, Lancet 343:1583-1584, 1994). To mitigate the risk of viral contamination during recombinant protein production, downstream purification processes are designed to include process steps that remove endogenous and adventitious viruses. Adequate virus clearance is obtained by a combination of several process steps that provide either virus inactivation or virus removal from the process feed stream. While viral inactivation is achieved using techniques such as incubation at low pH, heat treatment, and detergents, virus removal is typically performed using chromatography and filtration (Curtis et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering 84(2):179-186, 2003).
      Unlike chromatography media, which removes viruses based on physicochemical properties such as net charge, virus filtration removes viruses by size exclusion and is therefore considered a more robust technique. So far usage of virus filtration during downstream purification of biotherapeutics derived from mammalian cell cultures has been limited to removal of retroviruses (80-100 nm diameter) due to lack of high throughput membranes with nominal pore size less than 60 nm.
      Recent advances in membrane technology have enabled manufacturing of high throughput membranes with nominal pore size of 20 nm. These virus filters are retentive to parvoviruses (18-26 nm diameter) and allow passage of proteins that are as large as 160 kD (˜8 nm), e.g., monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).
      The high selectivity and high throughput with parvovirus filters is achieved by casting a thin retentive membrane layer on a microporous substrate. The thin retentive layer while allows very fine separation of proteins and viruses, it is also susceptible to fouling by impurities in the process feedstream resulting in lower filter capacity and flux. The fouling of the virus filters has been attributed to contaminants such as protein aggregates and denatured protein. Bohonak and Zydney (Bohonak and Zydney, Journal of Membrane Science 254 (1-2):71-79, 2005) showed that loss in filter capacity could be due to cake formation or pore blockage. Other recent reports (Bolton et al., Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 43:55-63, 2006; Levy et al., Filtration in the Biopharamaceutical Industry. (Meltzer, T. H. and Jornitz, M. W., eds.) pp. 619-646, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1998) have attributed the likely cause of filter fouling to the adsorption of impurities to the pore walls. Several publications (Bolton et al., Biotechnology and Applied Biochemistry 42:133-142, 2005; Hirasaki et al., Polymer Journal 26(11):1244-1256, 1994; Omar and Kempf, Transfusion 42(8):1005-1010, 2002) have also demonstrated that reduction in filter capacity or plugging of pores can decrease viral retention by few orders of magnitude, affecting the robustness of the unit operation.
      A lot of recent research has thus focused on identification of pre-filters for removing the foulants from the process feedstream to minimize virus filter fouling and ensuring high capacity, high throughput and robust viral retention. Bolton et al. (Bolton et al. 2006) performed a thorough study that involved testing of several membranes as prefilters and demonstrated that it was possible to increase capacity of normal flow parvovirus (NFP) membranes by almost an order of magnitude by using VIRESOLVE™ depth filter as a prefilter. Brown et al. (Brown et al. 2008, Use of Charged Membranes to Identify Soluble Protein Foulants in order to Facilitate Parvovirus Filtration. IBC's 20 th Antibody Development and Production, San Diego, Calif.) evaluated a strong cation exchange membrane adsorber as a prefilter to parvovirus retentive filter and showed that the capacity of virus filter could be increased by several fold for eleven different mAb streams. The authors hypothesized that the cation exchange membrane adsorber removed large molecular weight (˜600-1500 kD) protein aggregates from the feedstream by competitive adsorption, preventing the virus filter from plugging. U.S. Pat. No. 7,118,675 (Siwak et al.) describes a process that utilizes a charge-modified membrane to remove protein aggregates from a protein solution to prevent fouling of virus filter.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention is based, at least in part, on the experimental finding that fouling of parvovirus filters could be due to impurities other than those mentioned in the literature and more comprehensive prefiltration solutions are required to improve the virus filtration capacity. Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel prefiltration solution that performs significantly better than the best prefiltration approach mentioned in the literature (cation-exchange membrane adsorbers).
      In one aspect, the invention concerns a method of improving the filtration capacity of a virus filter during protein purification, comprising subjecting a composition comprising a protein to be purified to a cation exchange step and an endotoxin removal step, in either order, prior to passing through said virus filter.

      In another embodiment, the composition comprising the protein to be purified is subjected to a cation exchange step and endotoxin removal step simultaneously, prior to virus filtration, by keeping the two media together in a single module.
      In yet another embodiment, the endotoxin removal step is directly followed by virus filtration.
      In a further embodiment, the cation exchange step is directly followed by virus filtration.
      In a different embodiment, virus filtration is performed at a pH between about 4 and about 10.
      In another embodiment, the protein concentration in the composition to be purified is about 1-40 g/L.
      In yet another embodiment, the antibody to be purified is to one or more antigens selected from the group consisting of HER1 (EGFR), HER2, HER3, HER4, VEGF, CD20, CD22, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18, an ICAM, VLA-4, VCAM, IL-17A and/or F, IgE, DR5, CD40, Apo2L/TRAIL, EGFL7, NRP1, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Factor D.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02393874,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       B lymphocyte stimulator is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) superfamily that induces both in vivo and in vitro B-cell proliferation and differentiation (Moore et al., Science 285: 260-263 (1999)). BLyS is distinguishable from other B-cell growth and differentiation factors such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-13, IL-15, CD40L, or CD27L (CD70) by its monocyte-specific gene and protein expression pattern and its specific receptor distribution and biological activity on B lymphocytes. BLyS expression is not detected on natural killer (“NK”) cells, T cells or B-cells, but is restricted to cells of myeloid origin. BLyS expression on resting monocytes is upregulated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). The gene encoding BLyS has been mapped to chromosome 13q34.
       Human BLyS is expressed as a 285 amino acid type II membrane-bound polypeptide and a soluble 152 amino acid polypeptide (Moore et al., 1999 supra). The membrane-bound form of BLyS has a predicted transmembrane spanning domain between amino acid residues 47 and 73. The NH 2-terminus of the soluble form of BLyS begins at Ala 134 of the membrane-bound form of BLyS. Soluble recombinant BLyS has been shown to induce in vitro proliferation of murine splenic B-cells and to bind to a cell-surface receptor on these cells (Moore et al., 1999 supra). Soluble BLyS administration to mice has been shown to result in an increase in the proportion of CD45R dull, Ly6D bright (also known as ThB) B-cells and an increase in serum IgM and IgA levels (Moore et al., 1999 supra). Thus, BLyS displays a B-cell tropism in both its receptor distribution and biological activity.
       Successful development of tumor-targeted therapeutic agents is dependent, in part, on the site-specific delivery of therapeutic agents and also on the biological activity of the delivered agent. Monoclonal antibodies have been employed to impart selectivity to otherwise indiscriminately cytotoxic agents such as toxins, radioneuclides, and growth factors (Williams et al., 1990; Rowlinson-Busza et al., 1992; Wahl, 1994). One such molecule is gelonin, a 29-kDa ribosome-inactivating plant toxin with a potency and mechanism of action similar to ricin A-chain (RTA) but with improved stability and reduced toxicity (Stirpe et al., 1992; Rosenblum et al., 1995). Previous studies have identified and examined the biological properties of numerous chemical conjugates of the plant toxin gelonin and various antibodies (Boyle et al., 1995; Xu et al., 1996; Rosenblum et al., 1999). In previous studies, antibody ZME-018 was chemically coupled to purified gelonin, and this immunoconjugate demonstrated specific cytotoxicity against antigen-positive melanoma cells both in tissue culture and in human tumor xenograft models (Rosenblum et al., 1991; Mujoo et al., 1995).
       There exists a need for improved therapeutic agents with specificity for abnormally proliferating B-cells.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       The present invention concerns methods of generating and using molecules that possess targeting activity, such as to a cancer cell, including in a tumor, for example, and cytotoxic activity. The molecule may comprise a conjugated polypeptide, for example. The present invention also includes compositions that are generated from these conjugated polypeptides. Proteinaceous conjugates of the invention, for example, include a compound that comprises both a toxin and a BLyS polypeptide. In some embodiments, the conjugated polypeptides are engineered recombinantly to produce a fusion protein. Conjugated compounds may be also attached to one another by a linker, for example.
       In specific embodiments of the invention, the targeting activity and the cytotoxic activity are provided to the molecule by a separate moiety of the molecule, although alternatively one moiety may comprise part or all of both targeting and cytotoxic activities.
       One with skill in the art realizes that “BLyS” may be interchangeable with BAFF, BLYS, TALL1, THANK, ZTNF4, TALL-1, TNFSF20, and delta BAFF polynucleotides or polypeptides, although in alternative embodiments it is not interchangeable. One of skill in the art recognizes how to determine if the molecule that is potentially interchangeable with BLyS would be suitable, such as by disclosure provided herein and/or available in the art. As envisioned by the present invention, SEQ ID NO:1 refers to the full-length 285 amino acid human BLyS polypetide. SEQ ID NO:20 refers to the polynucleotide sequence of human BLyS. Amino acid residues 134-285 of SEQ ID NO:1 comprise a soluble isoform of the BLyS polypeptide, which in certain embodiments is the isoform that is used in the conjugated polypeptides of the present invention. Mouse (polypeptide SEQ ID NO:2; nucleotide SEQ ID NO:3) BLyS, or any other orthologs of BLyS are also contemplated by the present invention. Functional equivalents of BLyS are also appropriate for use with the targeted conjugated polypeptides of the present invention. For example, polypeptides retaining BLyS activity with at least 80% sequence homology, at least 85% sequence homology, and at least 90% sequence homology with any of SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2 are contemplated. In a further specific embodiment, the amino acid sequence of BLyS is at least about 40, at least about 50, at least about 75, at least about 100, at least about 125, at least about 150, at least about 175, at least about 200, at least about 225, at least about 250, or at least about 275 contiguous amino acids from SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:2. In other embodiments, functional equivalents comprise at least the D-E loop involved in receptor recognition. (See Oren et al., Nat Struct Biol. 2002 April; 9(4):288-92).
       In some embodiments wildtype BLyS may be utilized, and in other embodiments mutant BLyS may be utilized. Exemplary BLyS mutants include a mutation at Cys146 (Chen et al., 2002; 2004; 2005), and in specific embodiments the mutation is to alanine or valine. BLyS mutants employed in the invention will retain the ability to target B cells, such as by retaining the ability to bind at least one BLyS receptor. A BLyS mutant may enhance any activity over a wild type BLyS, including the ability to bind a B cell, such as through a BLyS receptor.
       The BLyS targeted polypeptides of the present invention are targeted to cells that express a BLyS receptor, such as TNFRSF13B/TACI (SEQ ID NO:4), TNFRSF17/BCMA (SEQ ID NO: 5), and TNFRSF13C/BAFFR (SEQ ID NO: 6). In certain embodiments of the invention, the conjugated polypeptides of the present invention will specifically bind a cell expressing a functional equivalent of SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:6. In certain embodiments of the invention, it is contemplated that cells expressing a BLyS receptor may be associated with abnormal B-cell proliferation. One with skill in the art realizes that BLyS may form dimers or trimers in order to mediate receptor recognition. It will be understood that proteinaceous compositions of conjugated polypeptides as envisioned herein will allow for the formation of BLyS dimers, trimers, or any multimeric protein complex.
       In certain embodiments, the BLyS polypeptide is attached to a molecule. In preferred embodiments, the attachment is a covalent attachment. In additional embodiments, the molecule is a cytotoxic agent, drug, a chemotherapeutic agent, a radioisotope, a pro-apoptosis agent, an anti-angiogenic agent, a hormone, a cytokine, a growth factor, a peptide, a protein, an antibiotic, an enzyme (such as Granzyme B or Granzyme A, for example), an antibody, a Fab fragment of an antibody, an imaging agent, a nucleic acid or an antigen, for example. These molecules are representative only. Molecules within the scope of the present invention include virtually any molecule that may be attached to a BLyS polypeptide and administered to a human subject. In preferred embodiments, the pro-aptoptosis agent is gramicidin, magainin, mellitin, defensin, or cecropin, for example. In other preferred embodiments, the anti-angiogenic agent is thrombospondin, angiostatin, endostatin or pigment epithelium-drived factor. In further preferred embodiments, the cytokine is interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-5, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-18, interferon-γ (IF-γ), IF-α, IF-β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), or GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor), for example. Such examples are representative only and are not intended to exclude other pro-apoptosis agents, anti-angiogenic agents or cytokines known in the art.
       In some embodiments of the invention, a recombinant gelonin peptide toxin is provided (shown in SEQ ID NO:7), which is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,631,348, and which is herein incorporated by reference. The recombinant gelonin toxin or the present invention may be any portion or fragment of SEQ ID NO:7 that retains toxin activity. In certain embodiments, the gelonin comprises residues 110-210 of SEQ ID NO:7. In a further specific embodiment, the amino acid sequence of rGelonin is at least about 30, at least about 40, at least about 50, at least about 75, at least about 100, at least about 125, at least about 150, at least about 175, at least about 200, at least about 225, or at least about 250 contiguous amino acids from SEQ ID NO:7. Other compounds of the present invention include a recombinant gelonin toxin that contains the core toxin region in addition to having at least 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 or more contiguous amino acid residues of SEQ ID NO:7 in addition to the core toxin region. In other embodiments of the invention, gelonin comprises SEQ ID NO:21 (Genbank Accession No. P33186).

The disorder may be initially refractory to the treatment, or the disorder may become refractory to the treatment during an initial or subsequent treatment.
       Other embodiments of the invention concern compositions of the present invention for the prevention and/or treatment of at least one symptom of a B-cell proliferative disorder. In particular embodiments of the invention, compositions of the present invention are employed for the prevention and/or treatment of an auto-immune disorder, such as arthritis or lupus, for example.

For example, a BLyS receptor molecule, such as SEQ ID NO:4 (gene sequence SEQ ID NO:12), is introduced by a suitable vector into a host liver cell. The expression of the BLyS receptor is controlled by a hepatoma-specific promoter. Thus, BLyS conjugated polypeptides may be targeted to hepatoma cells for therapy.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002625768,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      L-fucose, also referred to as 6-deoxy-L-galactose, is a monosaccharide that is a component of some N- and O-linked glycans and glycolipids in animals. (See Becker and Lowe, Glycobiology 13:41 R-51R (2003).) Fucose is typically added as a terminal modification to glycans, including glycans attached to blood group antigens, selectins and antibodies. Fucose can be attached to glycans via α(1,2)-, α(1,3)-, α(1,4)- and α(1,6)-linkages by specific fucosyltransferases. α(1,2)-fucose linkages are typically associated with the H-blood group antigens. α(1,3)- and α(1,4)-fucose linkages are associated with modification of Lewis X antigens. α(1,6)-fucose linkages are associated with N-linked GlcNAc molecules, such as those on antibodies.
      Fucosylation of proteins is believed to play a role in mammalian development. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of the FX gene exhibit pleiotropic abnormalities including a lethal phenotype. Reduced recovery of mice from heterozygous crosses was also reported. (Becker et al., Mammalian Genome 14:130-139 (2003). Aberrant protein fucosylation has been proposed to be associated with human disease, including up-regulation of sialyl Lewis X and sialyl Lewis y in cancers. These glycans are ligands for E- and P-selectin molecules. In it speculated that increases in sialyl Lewis X and sialyl Lewis y glycans on cancer cells increases metastases through interaction with E- and P-selectins on endothelium. Increased fucosylated glycans have also been observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Currently, however, there are no approved therapeutic approaches targeting protein fucosylation levels.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002564569,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Affinity chromatography allows for the purification of a protein of interest from a mixture of molecules, such as a cellular harvest, based on the preferential binding of the protein of interest to a target in solid phase, such as a gel matrix. This solid phase component typically is formed into a column through which the mixture containing the protein of interest is applied. In this initial step, called the capture step, the protein of interest specifically binds to the target in solid phase whereas other components in the mixture flow through the column. However, certain components within the mixture, including high molecular weight species (HMWs), low molecular weight species (LMWs) and host cell proteins (HCPs), may remain within the column as impurities along with the protein of interest. Thus, typically one or more wash steps are carried out in which one or more wash solutions are applied to the column to remove these impurities while maintaining the binding of the protein of interest to the solid phase. Finally, after removal of impurities by the washing step(s), the protein of interest is recovered from the column by an elution step, in which an elution solution that disrupts the binding of the protein of interest to the solid phase target, is applied to the column and the protein of interest is recovered in the eluate. Accordingly, the effectiveness of affinity chromatography in purifying a protein of interest depends in large part on identifying wash conditions that allow for efficient removal of impurities (e.g., HMWs, LMWs, HCPs) while not disrupting the binding of the protein of interest to the solid phase target or otherwise having undesired effects.
      A particularly useful type of affinity chromatography is Protein A chromatography for the purification of proteins that contain an immunoglobulin Fc region, such as antibodies and Fc fusion proteins. Various wash solutions have been described for removal of impurities from Protein A columns, including wash solutions containing one of the following: hydrophobic electrolytes (e.g., tetramethylammonium chloride, tetraethylammonium chloride, tetrapropylammonium chloride or tetrabutylammonium chloride at pH1-5.0-7.0), solvents (e.g., 5-20% isopropanol or polypropylene/hexylene glycol), urea (e.g., at a concentration of 1-4 M), detergents (e.g., 0.1-1% Tween 20 or Tween 80), polymers (e.g., 5-15% polyethylene glycol such as PEG400 or PEG8000) or highly concentrated buffer solutions such as Tris, HCl, acetate, sulfate, phosphate or citrate buffers at a concentration of 0.8-2.0 M at a pH between 5.0 and 7.0 (see e.g., Shukla, A. A. and Hinckley, P. (2005) Biotechnol. Prog. 24:1115-1121; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,127,526 and 6,333,398 by Blank; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,870,034 by Breece et al.). Many of these chemicals, however, have one or more disadvantages, including but not limited to toxicity, corrosiveness, flammability, instability, costly disposal as hazardous waste and/or inefficient removal of contaminants during the washing step.
      Protein A chromatography wash buffers containing salt (such as sodium chloride), alone or in combination with either a detergent (e.g. Tween 20), a solvent (e.g., hexylene glycol) or a polymer (e.g., polyethylene glycol), have also been described (U.S. Pat. No. 6,870,034 by Breece et al.).
      Barron et al. describe an intermediate wash solution for Protein A chromatography containing 0.5 to 2.0 M arginine in a phosphate/acetate buffer at pH 5.0-7.5 (optimally 1M arginine, 0.1M phosphate/acetate buffer at pH 5.0). This arginine wash step is reported to remove HCP contaminants. The authors also tested an intermediate wash solution that contained sodium chloride at 0.5-2.0 M at pH 5.0-7.5 but reported that the NaCl wash showed no significant decrease in HCP (Barron et al., “Improving Purity on Protein A Affinity Media Through Use of an Arginine Intermediate Wash Step”, http://www.priorartdatabase.com/IPCOM/000127319).
      Sun et al. also describe washing of affinity chromatography columns, such as a Protein A column, with a wash buffer that contains arginine, or an arginine derivative, at a concentration of 0.1-2.0 M and at a pH of 4.5-8.0 (U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 20080064860 and 20080064861; PCT Publication No. WO 2008/031020).
      Arginine has also been used to elute proteins from affinity chromatography columns and other types of purification columns. For example, Arakawa et al. describe methods of eluting antibodies from a Protein A column using an elution buffer containing 0.5-20 M arginine at pH 4.1-5.0 (Arakawa et al. (2004) Protein Expression and Purification 36:244-248; Tsumoto, K, et al. (2004) Biotechnol. Prog. 20:1301-1308; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050176109). Additionally. U.S. Pat. No. 7,501,495 by Ejima et al. describes methods of eluting proteins from a gel filtration column by using a developing solution containing arginine hydrochloride. Ghose et al. describe methods of eluting proteins of interest from underivatized silica using an arginine gradient as the eluant (Ghose, S. et al. (2004) Biotech. Bioeng. 87:413-423). U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030050450 by Coffman et al. describes methods of dissociating Fc containing molecules from complexes of the Fe containing molecule and Protein A, wherein the Fc/Protein A complexes are applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (HIC) and the column is washed with a buffer containing arginine.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      This invention provides an efficient and robust wash solution for affinity chromatography, as well as washing methods using this solution. This wash solution is applied in a washing step prior to the elution step, and its use results in high yields and high concentrations of the protein of interest eluted from the affinity matrix while effectively removing both high molecular weight species (HMWs) and host cell proteins (HCPs) from the starting material applied to the matrix. This wash solution is characterized by the presence of both arginine (or an arginine derivative) and a nonbuffering salt, such as a halogen salt. Preferably, the wash solution is at high pH, above 8.0. This combination of arginine (or an arginine derivative) and a nonbuffering salt removes considerably more impurities than wash solutions containing either arginine or salt alone and results in a sharper elution peak correlating with a high concentration of the recovered protein of interest.
      Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a method of producing a purified protein of interest using an affinity chromatography (AC) matrix to which a protein of interest is bound, the method comprising washing the AC matrix with one or more wash solutions comprising (i) arginine, or an arginine derivative, and (ii) a nonbuffering salt, prior to elution of the protein of interest from the AC matrix. Preferably, the protein of interest is loaded onto the AC matrix prior to washing with the one or more wash solutions and the protein of interest is eluted from the AC matrix after washing with the one or more wash solutions, in particular, to remove impurities from the AC matrix.
      In a preferred embodiment, the AC matrix is a Protein A column. In various other embodiments, the AC matrix can be, for example, selected from the group consisting of a Protein G column, a Protein A/G column, a Protein L column, an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) column, a calmodulin resin column, a MEP HyperCel™ column, a column that binds maltose binding protein (MBP), a column that binds glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and a column that binds Strep-Tag II. In a preferred embodiment, the protein of interest is an antibody or antibody fragment that binds to the AC matrix, such as a Protein A column, although other proteins that bind to the affinity matrices described herein are also suitable for purification according to the methods of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002473691,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Vaccination has become a standard procedure for the prevention of numerous infectious diseases. The application of vaccines to other diseases, such as cancer, is now an attractive possibility due to advances in molecular engineering and a better understanding of tumor immunology.
       Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Despite an abundance of cancer-related research, conventional therapies that combine surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, often fail to effectively treat established cancers. Reliable methods of prevention also remain unavailable.
       Cancer typically involves the malfunction of genes that contribute to the regulation of the cell cycle or cell proliferation, such as growth factors and their receptors, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes. The products of many of these genes are expressed on the surface of a wide variety of tumor cells and, hence, are designated tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). The introduction of genes encoding TAAs directly into a subject has been shown to generate a protective immune response against the TAA in many experimental models, making these molecules a target for vaccine therapy. However, because many of these gene products are also expressed in normal cells, albeit at lower levels, many immunological therapies targeting TAAs have proven ineffective due to self-tolerance.
       Genes coding for several tumor-associated antigens (TAA) have been isolated, characterized and inserted in genetic vectors such as plasmid DNA and viral vectors. One tumor-associated antigen that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer is telomerase (TERT).
       Telomerase is a DNA polymerase that normally functions in maintaining telomere length at the ends of chromosomes. During normal cell growth, an RNA primer attaches to the 5′ end of DNA and initiates replication. Upon removal of the RNA primer, a gap in length is introduced to the resulting daughter strand of DNA. Thus, replication of a linear strand of DNA with conventional polymerases leads to shortening of telomere length in each progressive round of replication. Such shortening of telomere length is responsible for cellular senescence or aging of normal human somatic cells.
       Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein comprising an RNA component and a catalytic protein component (telomerase reverse transcriptase). The catalytic component of human telomerase was described by Meyerson et al. ( Cell 1197: 785-95 (1990) and Nakamura et al. ( Science 277: 955-59 (1997)). The TERT enzyme uses its RNA component as a template for telomere DNA synthesis, thus allowing telomeres to maintain their length over successive generations of cell growth. Such maintenance of telomere length over numerous proliferative cycles allows a cell to escape normal senescence and become immortal, allowing a tumor to grow and metastasize over great lengths of time. Because telomerase confers replicative immortality to cells, telomerase activity has been detected in cancerous cell lines and a diverse range of tumor types (Kim et al. Science 266: 2011-15 (1994)). Conversely, telomerase is inactive or only transiently expressed at low levels in normal human tissues and normal somatic cell cultures. The combination of telomerase over-expression in most cancer types as well as low or absent expression in normal cells makes TERT a target for therapy and/or prophylaxis of diseases associated with aberrant cellular proliferation such as cancer.
       The development of a telomerase-specific vaccine is now possible because the catalytic and RNA components of telomerase have been cloned and characterized (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,178). However, the development and commercialization of many vaccines have been hindered by difficulties associated with obtaining high expression levels of the desired immunogen in successfully transformed host organisms. The development of efficacious DNA-based vaccines has also been hindered by an inability to generate an immune response of sufficient magnitude in treated individuals to lead to tumor regression in a clinical setting. Therefore, despite the identification of the wild-type nucleotide sequences encoding telomerase proteins described above, it would be highly desirable to develop a vaccine which is capable of eliciting an enhanced TERT-specific immune response relative to a wild-type full-length TERT cDNA, when delivered to a mammal. It would also be desirable to develop methods for treating or preventing TERT-associated cancers which utilize nucleic acid molecules or proteins that safely and effectively potentiate a TERT-specific immune response.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       As stated above, expression of the tumor-associated antigen telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene is commonly associated with the development or presence of adenocarcinomas, including colorectal carcinomas. To this end, the present invention relates to compositions and methods to elicit or enhance immunity to the protein products expressed by the human TERT (hTERT) gene. Specifically, the present invention provides polynucleotides encoding fusion proteins wherein the fusion proteins comprise the hTERT protein, or variant thereof, fused to a substantial portion of the B subunit of E. coli heat labile enterotoxin (LTB). The present invention also provides recombinant vectors, including but not limited to, adenovirus and plasmid vectors, comprising said polynucleotides and host cells comprising said recombinant vectors. Also provided herein are purified fusion proteins encoded by invention polynucleotides. The hTERT-LTB fusion proteins and polynucleotides which encode said fusion proteins are useful as vaccines for the prevention and/or treatment of telomerase-associated cancer. Said vaccines are useful as a monotherapy or as part of a therapeutic regime, said regime comprising administration of a second vaccine such as a polynucleotide, cell-based, protein, or peptide-based vaccine, or comprising radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
       In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the sequence of nucleotides encoding hTERT and/or the sequence of nucleotides encoding LTB comprises codons that have been optimized for high levels of expression in a human host cell. In other words, in certain embodiments of the invention, the codon usage pattern of the polynucleotide sequence resembles that of highly expressed mammalian and/or human genes.
       Another aspect of this invention is an expression construct comprising nucleotides encoding hTERT-LTB. In preferred embodiments of this portion of the invention, the construct comprises a TPA leader sequence before the coding sequence for the TERT gene to ensure that the TERT-LTB fusion protein is secreted.
       In additional preferred embodiments of the present invention, telomerase catalytic activity of the telomerase antigen is inactivated so that the encoded TERT fusion protein is safer than wild-type TERT for vaccine purposes. The enzymatic activity of the TERT fusion protein can be inactivated by addition of mutations/deletions to the TERT-encoding nucleotide sequence. In specific exemplary embodiments of the invention, nucleotides have been mutated in order to change specific amino acids D712A and V713I in the human TERT protein sequence and D702A and V703I in the mouse TERT protein sequence.
       The present invention further provides adenoviral and plasmid vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence that encodes an hTERT-LTB fusion protein. This invention also describes the use of the adenovirus and plasmid vectors in immunogenic compositions and vaccines for the prevention and/or treatment of hTERT-associated cancer.
       Also provided are adenovirus vectors comprising a sequence of nucleotides that encode a human TERT protein or TERT protein variant. Variants useful in this aspect of the invention comprise mutations that function to eliminate telomerase catalytic activity. In preferred embodiments of this portion of the invention, the adenovirus vector is an Ad6 vector. In other preferred embodiments the Ad vector is an Ad 5 vector.
       The present invention further provides methods for preventing the development of a cancer in a patient or treating a patient with a telomerase-associated tumor by eliciting an immune response to the TERT protein by administering a vaccine or pharmaceutical composition comprising the TERT fusions or TERT fusion proteins provided by the invention. In preferred embodiments of the methods herein, the immune response is enhanced relative to the response elicited by a wild-type TERT.
       As used throughout the specification and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include the plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
       As used throughout the specification and appended claims, the following definitions and abbreviations apply:
       The term “promoter” refers to a recognition site on a DNA strand to which the RNA polymerase binds. The promoter forms an initiation complex with RNA polymerase to initiate and drive transcriptional activity. The complex can be modified by activating sequences termed “enhancers” or inhibiting sequences termed “silencers”.
       The term “cassette” refers to a nucleotide or gene sequence that is to be expressed from a vector, for example, the nucleotide or gene sequence encoding the hTERT(AI)-LTB fusion. In general, a cassette comprises a gene sequence that can be inserted into a vector, which in some embodiments, provides regulatory sequences for expressing the nucleotide or gene sequence. In other embodiments, the nucleotide or gene sequence provides the regulatory sequences for its expression. In further embodiments, the vector provides some regulatory sequences and the nucleotide or gene sequence provides other regulatory sequences. For example, the vector can provide a promoter for transcribing the nucleotide or gene sequence and the nucleotide or gene sequence provides a transcription termination sequence. The regulatory sequences that can be provided by the vector include, but are not limited to, enhancers, transcription termination sequences, splice acceptor and donor sequences, introns, ribosome binding sequences, and poly(A) addition sequences.

       The abbreviation “LTB” refers generally to the B subunit of heat labile enterotoxin of E. coli, or substantial portion thereof, including subunits which are truncated on the C-terminal or N-terminal end but maintain adjuvant activity, as well as subunits that contain internal amino acid insertions, deletions, or substitutions but maintain adjuvant activity (Fingerut et al. Vaccine 23: 4685-4696 (2005)).
       As used herein, a “fusion protein” refers to a protein having at least two heterologous polypeptides covalently linked in which one polypeptide comes from one protein sequence or domain and the other polypeptide comes from a second protein sequence or domain. The fusion proteins of the present invention comprise a TERT polypeptide or fragment or variant thereof, and a second polypeptide, which comprises a substantial portion of LTB. The TERT polypeptide, fragment or variant thereof may be a human TERT or TERT homolog from another species, e.g. mouse. The polypeptides that comprise the fusion protein are preferably linked N-terminus to C-terminus. The TERT polypeptide and the LTB polypeptide can be fused in any order. In some embodiments of this invention, the C-terminus of the TERT polypeptide is fused to the N-terminus of LTB, as exemplified in FIGS. 1 and 2. However, fusion proteins in which the LTB subunit is fused to the N-terminus of the TERT polypeptide are also contemplated.
       The term “TERT fusion protein” or “TERT-LTB fusion protein” are used interchangeably herein as a general term which refers to a fusion as described above, which comprises a TERT polypeptide or fragment or variant thereof fused to an LTB polypeptide. The term “TERT-LTB fusion” refers to a nucleic acid sequence in which at least a portion of the TERT gene is fused to a substantial portion of LTB subunit of E. coli heat labile enterotoxin. The term “TERT-LTB fusion protein” refers to a polypeptide encoded by a TERT-LTB fusion as described. The terms “TERT-LTB fusion” and “TERT-LTB fusion protein” are also understood to refer to fragments thereof, homologs thereof, and functional equivalents thereof (collectively referred to as “variants”), such as those in which one or more amino acids is inserted, deleted or replaced by other amino acid(s). The TERT-LTB fusions of the present invention, upon administration to a mammal such as a human being, can stimulate an immune response by helper T cells or cytotoxic T cells, at least as well as a “wild-type” hTERT sequence. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the TERT-LTB fusion can enhance the immune response as compared to a wild-type hTERT.
       The term “treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those prone to have the disorder or those in which the disorder is to be prevented.

       A “disorder” is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the molecules of the present invention, including the nucleic acid molecules described herein and the fusion proteins that are encoded by said nucleic acid molecules. Encompassed by the term “disorder” are chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. The molecules of the present invention are intended for use as treatments for disorders or conditions characterized by aberrant cell proliferation, including, but not limited to, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer.
       The term “effective amount” means sufficient vaccine composition is introduced to produce the adequate levels of the polypeptide, so that an immune response results. One skilled in the art recognizes that this level may vary.
       A “conservative amino acid substitution” refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by another, chemically similar, amino acid residue. Examples of such conservative substitutions are: substitution of one hydrophobic residue (isoleucine, leucine, valine, or methionine) for another; substitution of one polar residue for another polar residue of the same charge (e.g., arginine for lysine; glutamic acid for aspartic acid).
       “hTERT” refers to a human telomerase reverse transcriptase antigen or nucleotides encoding the human telomerase reverse transcriptase antigen. “hTERTopt” refers to a codon-optimized nucleotide sequence encoding human telomerase reverse transcriptase antigen.
       “Substantially similar” means that a given nucleic acid or amino acid sequence shares at least 75%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and even more preferably at least 95% identity with a reference sequence. In the present invention, the reference sequence can be relevant portions of the wild-type human TERT nucleotide or amino acid sequence, as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:11 and 12, respectively, or the nucleotide or amino acid sequence of LTB, as set forth in SEQ ID NOs:13 (opt sequence) and 14, as dictated by the context of the text. The reference sequence may also be, for example, a wild-type rhesus monkey or murine TERT sequence. Thus, a TERT protein sequence that is “substantially similar” to the wild-type human TERT protein or fragment thereof will share at least 75% identity with the relevant fragment of the wild-type human TERT, along the length of the fragment, preferably 85% identity, more preferably 90% identity and even more preferably 95% identity. Whether a given mTERT, hTERT, or LTB amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence is “substantially similar” to a reference sequence can be determined for example, by comparing sequence information using sequence analysis software such as the GAP computer program, version 6.0, available from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG). The GAP program utilizes the alignment method of Needleman and Wunsch ( J. Mol. Biol. 48:443, 1970), as revised by Smith and Waterman ( Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482, 1981).
       A “substantial portion” of a gene, variant, fragment, or subunit thereof, means a portion of at least 50%, preferably 75%, more preferably 90%, and even more preferably 95% of a reference sequence.
       A “gene” refers to a nucleic acid molecule whose nucleotide sequence codes for a polypeptide molecule. Genes may be uninterrupted sequences of nucleotides or they may include such intervening segments as introns, promoter regions, splicing sites and repetitive sequences. A gene can be either RNA or DNA. A preferred gene is one that encodes the invention peptide.
       The term “nucleic acid” or “nucleic acid molecule” is intended for ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), probes, oligonucleotides, fragment or portions thereof, and primers.
       “Wild-type TERT” or “wild-type protein” or “wt protein” refers to a protein comprising a naturally occurring sequence of amino acids or variant thereof. The amino acid sequence of wild-type human TERT is set forth in SEQ ID NO:12. The amino acid sequence of the wild-type human TERT was previously described (U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,178; U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,836; U.S. Pat. No. 6,927,285; U.S. Patent Application 2003-0096344; Meyerson et al., Cell 90: 785-95 (1997); Nakamura et al., Science 277: 955-59 (1997)).
       “Wild-type TERT gene” refers to a gene comprising a sequence of nucleotides that encodes a naturally occurring TERT protein, including proteins of human origin or proteins obtained from another organism, including, but not limited to, other mammals such as rat, mouse and rhesus monkey.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200800448,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention provides novel coding sequences for use in plants. The coding sequences encode a chimeric insecticidal protein toxic to a wide range of lepidopteran species crop pests.
      Commercial formulations of naturally occurring B. thuringiensis isolates have long been used for the biological control of agricultural insect pests. Bt spores and crystals obtained from fermentation of Bacillus thuringiensis species are concentrated and formulated for foliar application according to conventional agricultural practices.
      Members of the family of Cry1 crystal proteins are known to exhibit bioactivity against lepidopteran insect larvae and are useful as agents for controlling lepidopteran insect pests. The precursor form of Cry1 δ-endotoxins consist of two approximately equal sized segments. The carboxy-terminal portion of the precursor protein, or pro-toxin segment, stabilizes crystal formation and exhibits no insecticidal activity. The amino-terminal half of the precursor protein comprises the toxin segment of the Cry1 protein and, based on alignment of conserved or substantially conserved sequences within Cry1 family members, can be further sub-divided into three structural domains. These three sub-domains are based on a three dimensional crystallographic structural model of a Cry1A δ-endotoxin in which the three sub-domains were referred to as Domain I, Domain II, and Domain III, respectively as measured from the amino terminus of the protein toxin segment. Domain I comprises about the first third of the active toxin segment and has been shown to be essential for channel formation (Thompson et al., 1995). Domains II and III respectively comprise about the central and carboxy-terminal segments of the active toxin portion. Domains II and III have both been implicated in receptor binding and insect species specificity, depending on the insect and δ-endotoxin being examined (Thompson et al., 1995).
      The likelihood of arbitrarily creating a chimeric protein with enhanced properties from the reassortment of the domain structures of the numerous native insecticidal crystal proteins known in the art is remote. This is a result of the complex nature of protein structure, folding, oligomerization, and activation including correct proteolytic processing of the chimeric precursor, if expressed in such form, to release an insecticidal toxin segment. Only by careful selection of specific target regions within each parental protein for inclusion into a chimeric structure can functional insecticidal toxins be constructed that exhibit improved insecticidal activity in comparison to the parental proteins from which the chimeras are derived. Experience has shown that reassembly of the toxin domains, i.e., assembly of a chimeric toxin consisting of domain I, II, and III of any two or more toxins that are different from each other, results in the construction of a protein that exhibits faulty crystal formation and/or the complete lack of any detectable insecticidal activity directed to a preferred target insect pest species. In some instances, a chimeric toxin will exhibit good crystal formation properties, yet exhibit no detectable insecticidal activity. Only by trial and error are effective insecticidal chimeras formulated, and even then, the skilled artisan is not certain to end up with a chimera that exhibits insecticidal activity that is equivalent to or improved in comparison to any single parental toxin protein from which the constituents of the chimera may have been derived.
      The literature reports examples of the construction or assembly of chimeric proteins from two or more Bt insecticidal crystal protein precursors, yet not all exhibited insecticidal or crystal forming properties that were equivalent to or improved in comparison to the precursor proteins from which the chimeras were derived. (Bosch et al. (WO95/06730); Thompson et al. (WO95/30753); Thompson et al. (WO95/30752); Malvar et al. (WO98/22595); Gilroy et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,130); Gilroy (U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,294); Lee et al. (1992) Gene 267:3115-3121; Honee et al. (1991) Mol. Microbiol. 5:2799-2806; Schnepf et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265:20923-20930; Perlak et al. (1990) Bio/Technol. 8:939-9943; Perlak et al (1993) Plant Mol. Biol. 22:313-321).
      Expression of B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxins in transgenic corn plants has proven to be an effective means of controlling agriculturally important insect pests (Perlak et al. 1990; 1993). Transgenic crops expressing B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxins enable growers to significantly reduce the time and costs associated with applications of topically applied chemical insecticides. Use of transgenes encoding B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxins is particularly advantageous. Crop plants expressing B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxins in areas under heavy insect pressure exhibit improved yields that are better than otherwise similar non-transgenic commercial plant varieties. However, it is anticipated that insects may evolve resistance to B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxins expressed in transgenic plants. Such resistance, should it become widespread, would clearly limit the commercial value of germplasm containing genes encoding such B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxins. One possible way of increasing the effectiveness of the transgenic insecticides against target pests and contemporaneously reducing the development of insecticide-resistant pests would be to ensure that transgenic crops express high levels of B. thuringiensis δ-endotoxins (McGaughey and Whalon 1993; Roush 1994). In addition, having a repository of insecticidal genes that are effective against groups of insect pests and which manifest their effects through different modes of action can safeguard against any development of resistance. Expression in a plant of two or more insecticidal compositions toxic to the same insect species, each insecticide being expressed at levels high enough to effectively delay the onset of resistance, would be another way to achieve control of the development of resistance. Examples of such insecticides useful in such combinations include but are not limited to Bt toxins, Xenorhabdus sp. or Photorhabdus sp. insecticidal proteins, deallergenized and de-glycosylated patatin proteins and/or permuteins, plant lectins, and the like. Achieving co-expression of multiple insecticidally active proteins in the same plant, and/or high expression levels of those insecticidal proteins without causing undesirable plant morphological effects has been elusive.
      Only a handful of the more than two-hundred and fifty individual insecticidal proteins that have been identified from Bacillus thuringiensis species have been tested for expression in plants. Several Cry1's, Cry3's, Cry2Aa and Cry2Ab, binary toxins Cry33/34 and Cry23/37, and a Cry9 have been successfully expressed in plants. Cry1 proteins represent the largest class of proteins that have been expressed in plants, but none have been expressed at high levels. It was necessary to target the Cry2Ab to the chloroplast to avoid undesirable phytotoxic effects. The majority of acres planted in recombinant plants express Cry1A proteins. The likelihood of the onset of resistance to Cry1A proteins by targeted insect pest species is substantially higher than it would be if a resistance management allele was also expressed along with the cry1 allele, or if the cry1 allele was expressed at high levels. Therefore it is desirable that alternative toxin genes be developed for expression in plants as supplements and replacements for those being used presently in the first and second generations of transgenic insect resistant plants.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002763603,"BACKGROUND ART
      Tryptophan, which is an essential amino add, has been widely used as a raw material for feed additives, medicines (e.g., infusion solutions), health food materials, etc. At present, a direct fermentation method using a microorganism is mainly used for the production of L-tryptophan.
      Previously, selective strains which exhibit resistance to analogues through chemical or physical mutation had mainly been used as the microorganism used for the production of L-tryptophan. However, as the rapid development of genetic recombination technology and the molecular-level regulatory mechanisms were identified in the 1990s, recombinant strains are mainly used by utilizing genetic engineering techniques.
      Meanwhile, the expression of a gene exporting a particular amino add has contributed to an increase in productivity of the corresponding amino add in microorganisms. The enhancement of the expression of the L-lysine-exporting gene (lysE) in a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium has improved the productivity of lysine (WO 9723597A2). Additionally, the enhancement of the rhtC gene in E. coli has improved the resistance to L-threonine, and simultaneously, has also improved the productivity of L-homoserine, L-threonine, and L-leucine (EP1013765A1). Additionally, Patent No. EP1016710B1 discloses that the productivity of L-glutamic add, L-lysine, L-threonine, L-alanine, L-histidine, L-proline, L-arginine, L-valine, and L-isoleucine was improved by the enhancement of yahN, yeaS, yfiK, and yggA genes, whose functions in E. coli have not yet been identified.
      However, exporting proteins showing specificity to L-tryptophan has not been reported up to date. Although the yddG gene of E. coli is known, it shows higher specificity to L-phenylalanine than to L-tryptophan ( FEMS Microbiol Lett 275 (2007), 312 to 318). Additionally, in a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium which is mainly used as a producing strain for L-amino add fermentation, genes that export L-tryptophan or an aromatic amino add have never been reported ( J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol. 2015 May; 42(5): 787 to 797).

In addition, through the introduction of mutations to further improve the ability to export a corresponding membrane protein, they have confirmed that the amount of L-tryptophan production was significantly improved. Thereby, the present disclosure has been completed.

As a result, they have confirmed that the microorganism can significantly improve the amount of L-tryptophan production compared to its parent strain, in which the gene is not expressed, and have also discovered a protein variant encoded by the gene, which allows the microorganism to more significantly improve the amount of L-tryptophan production, thereby confirming that L-tryptophan can be effectively produced through the same.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS

200101161,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      1. Technical Field
      The present invention relates to a DNA encoding a novel fusion protein which is used for preparing recombinant insulin. More specifically, the present invention relates to the use of the DNA for the preparation of insulin from the fusion protein, which is obtained by the expression of the DNA, through the action of thrombin and carboxypeptidase B.
      2. Background Art
      Insulin is a hormone secreted by the B cells of the islet of Langerhans in the pancreas when an animal ingests food, which is the most important hormone for storage or use of sugars, amino acids and fatty acids and for maintaining the blood sugar homeostasis. Although blood sugar, namely glucose in blood, is an essential energy source for a living body, if the blood sugar homeostasis is not maintained, then serious conditions may develop. Increased blood sugar level causes the excretion of sugar in the urine, resulting in loss of glucose, i.e. onset of a so-called diabetes. If this condition continues for long periods, complications can develop in the tissues of a living body. On the other hand, decreased blood sugar level leads to an insufficient supply of the energy source, resulting in imperilment of life. Homeostasis of the blood sugar level is maintained by balancing factors that act to increase the blood sugar level (e.g., glucagon, growth hormone, cortisol, catecholamine) with factors that act to decrease the blood sugar level. Insulin is the only hormone which can decrease the blood sugar level. Hence, the reduction in secretion functions resulted from some causes and, as a consequence, insufficient supply of insulin can induce insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). For patients suffering from such a disease, insulin is an indispensable drug.
      Human insulin is a polypeptide comprising an A chain with 21 amino acids and a B chain with 30 amino acids, which has one intrachain disulfide bond in the A chain and two disulfide bonds which link between the A chain and the B chain. Insulin is initially biosynthesized as “preproinsulin” on ribosomes in B cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. Preproinsulin is a linear molecule comprising a signal peptide with 24 amino acids (SP), a B chain (B), a C-peptide with 31 amino acids (C) and an A chain (A) linked in the order as represented by the formula “SP-B-C-A”. Upon transport to the endoplasmic reticulum, the signal peptide is cleaved out from the preproinsulin to produce “proinsulin (B-C-A)”. Proinsulin forms disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby taking on a three-dimensional structure. Proinsulin is cleaved with a prohormone-converting enzyme PC1/3 at the B-C junction and then cleaved with a converting enzyme PC2 at the C-A junction. Finally, N-terminal two basic amino acid residues of the C-peptide, which remain at the C-terminus of the B-chain when cleaved with PC1/3, are cut out with carboxypeptidase H. In this manner, insulin is produced.
      Methods for producing therapeutic insulin have been initially developed using extracts from the pancreas of animals such as bovine and pig. However, human insulin is different in amino acid composition from bovine insulin (at two positions in A chain and one position in B chain) and porcine insulin (at one position in B chain). Therefore, adverse effects (e.g., allergy) are inevitable in the use of bovine or porcine insulin in human bodies. Methods for semi-synthesis of human insulin from porcine insulin have been developed which utilize the transpeptidation reaction with trypsin. However, recombinant insulin produced by genetic recombinant techniques has currently gone mainstream due to its low production cost and good production efficiency.
      For the production of recombinant insulin, a number of methods have been developed. For example, the method developed by Eli Lilly Corp. is known, which method comprises expressing A chain and B chain separately using Escherichia coli; and mixing the A chain and the B chain in vitro to form the disulfide bridges, thereby linking them via the disulfide bonds (JP-B- 63-18960). This method, however, is poor in production efficiency. Then, Eli Lilly Corp. has developed an improved method which comprises expressing proinsulin; forming the disulfide bonds in vitro; and then cleaving out the C-peptide from the product with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B, thereby producing insulin (JP-B-1-48278 and Japanese Patent No. 2634176).
      Another method was developed by Novo Nordisk Corp., which method comprises expressing miniproinsulin comprising a B chain and an A chain linked via two basic amino acid residues, in yeast; and then treating the miniproinsulin with trypsin in vitro, thereby producing insulin (JP-B-7-121226 and JP-B-8-8871, and Japanese Patent No.2553326). This method has such advantages that the disulfide bonds are formed during the expression and secretion of the miniproinsulin and that the miniproinsulin can be isolated and purified readily because it is secreted into a cultured medium.
      Development of new recombinant insulin-production methods has been continued positively. Hoechst Corporation developed a method comprising expressing a new-type insulin derivative or preproinsulin in E. coli; forming the disulfide bonds in vitro; and then treating the product with lysylendopeptidase or clostripain/carboxypeptidase B, thereby producing insulin (JP-A-2-195896, JP-A-2-225498, JP-A-2-233698, JP-A-3-169895, JP-A4-258296, JP-A-6-228191, and JP-A-7-265092). Recently, a method has been developed by BIO-TECHNOLOGY GENERAL CORPORATION, in which a fusion protein comprising superoxide dismutase (SOD) linked with proinsulin is expressed in E. coli to increase both the expression efficiency and the disulfide bond-forming efficiency, and proinsulin is converted into insulin with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B (WO 96/20724). Thus, there are a number of approaches for recombinant insulin production, and further improvement has been made in expression efficiency, disulfide bond-forming efficiency and conversion into insulin.
      As the hosts for the production of recombinant proteins, a wide variety of hosts have been used including microorganisms, animals and plants. Among them, microorganisms are most frequently used due to their easy-to-handle property and good applicability for industrial use, and Escherichia coil and yeast are especially known. Recently, an expression system with Bacillus brevis has been known for recombinant proteins (see Japanese Patent No. 2082727; JP-A-62-201583; Yamagata, H. et al., J. Bacteriol. 169:1239-1245, 1987; Juzo Udaka, Nihon Nogei Kagaku-shi 61, 669-676, 1987; Takao, M. et al., Appi. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 30:75-80, 1989; Yamagata, H. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:3589-3593, 1989).
      The object of the present invention is to develop an expression system and a production method for insulin which have a high yield and a production efficiency equal to or better than those of the existing recombinant insulin production systems. That is, the object of the present invention is to develop a novel method for converting an insulin precursor into insulin, an environment where the disulfide bonds necessary for insulin activity can be formed, and an expression system with high yield.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002662927,"BACKGROUND
      In principle, allergic diseases are disorders of the immune system associated with a dysregulation of the T H1 and T H2 lymphocyte subsets [de Vries et al. 1999, Parronchi et al. 1999, Singh et al. 1999]. It has been postulated that with a declining incidence of infectious diseases due to vaccination, the use of antibiotics and other public health practices, a major source of T H1 immune provocation has been lost, with a consequent increase in the T H2 bias of immune responses towards environmental allergens [Holgate 1999, Shaheen et al. 1996].
      Of the various allergic diseases that affect the general population, peanut-induced anaphylaxis is particularly severe and represents the most common contributor of emergency department admissions for treatment of anaphylactic reactions.
      Allergies to peanut result from an aberrant immune response directed against an otherwise harmless environmental antigen. Peanut allergy and anaphylaxis are centred around a type 2 immune response, characterised by the generation of T H2 T cells and IgE antibody secreting B cells. By contrast, a types 1 immune response can be characterised by antibodies predominately of IgG (IgG2a isotype in mice), activation of NK cells and phagocytic cells, and the development of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Both type 1 and 2 responses are coordinated by helper T cells, which differentiate into several functionally different subsets including T H1 and T H2 lymphocytes. Theses subsets are characterised by their cytokine secretion profile [Mosmann et al. 1989], where T H1 cells produce IFN-gamma and T H2 cells typically secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13.
      Orally ingested peanut allergens first encounter the gut mucosal immune system. Microfold (M) cells are specialised follicle-associated cells that line the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract and lie in close proximity to Peyer's patches. They are responsible for the induction of tolerising and/or protective gut-associated immune responses. Sensitization to food allergens occurs when exogenous food antigens are taken up by M cells, and then presented to macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) [DeLong et al. 2011]. Once internalised by macrophages and DCs, the antigens are endocytosed, then denatured and degraded into peptides of around 12-20 amino acids in length. A small fraction of these small peptide fragments are then transported intracellularly and presented on the cell-surface MHC class II molecules for specific interaction with CD4 + T cells. These activated CD4 + T cells subsequently expand in number and release T H2 cytokines. The T H2 cells, IL-4 and IL-5 promote the differentiation of B cells, which bear allergens bound to surface immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors, into cells that secrete allergen-specific IgE antibodies [Turcanu et al. 2010]. These IgE-producing B cells then expand in number and become plasma cells that continuously secrete allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Environmental exposure to peanuts results in binding of peanut allergens to specific IgE-coating on mast cells and basophils. Subsequently, Fc receptor cross-linking provides a potent activation stimulus that results in the degranulation of basophils and mast cells, which rapidly release a variety of preformed proinflammatory and vasoactive compounds such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serine proteases, histamine and cytokines into the extracellular fluid to produce an inflammatory response [Sicherer et al. 2010], all of which culminate in the clinical manifestation of an acute allergic reaction [Long 2002].
      Local symptoms of peanut allergy include abdominal pain, vomiting, cramping and diarrhea, and are common even in cases of mild peanut allergy. This acute non-life threatening reaction causes a transient increase in intestinal permeability, which subsequently allows systemic distribution of macromolecules, such as whole peanut allergens, exacerbating the allergic response to subsequent exposure to peanut allergens, which can cause life-threatening anaphylactic reactions [Sanderson et al. 1993].
      Unlike traditional immunotherapy for allergic reactions to grass pollens, dust mite and bee sting venom, subcutaneous desensitization injections of peanut extracts have unacceptable risk-benefits [Oppenheimer et al. 1992]. Therefore, at present, avoiding peanuts is the only available method for prevent further reactions. However, strict avoidance is often an unrealistic strategy for many individuals, particularly in light of accidental exposure to peanuts that often occurs through ingestion of processed foods or foods prepared in the same vicinity of those containing peanuts, e.g., restaurants, schools, food courts and work canteens. Therefore, there remains a need for an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment and prevention of the peanut allergy.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002753194,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, x-linked, progressive neuromuscular disease affecting approximately one in 3,600 to 9200 live male births. The disorder is caused by frame shift mutations on the dystrophin gene abolishing the expression of the dystrophin protein. Due to the lack of the dystrophin protein, skeletal muscle, and ultimately heart and respiratory muscles, (e.g., intercostal muscles and diaphragm), degenerate causing premature death. Progressive weakness and muscle atrophy begins in childhood, starting in the lower legs and pelvis before spreading into the upper arms. Other symptoms include loss of certain reflexes, waddling gait, frequent falls, difficulty rising from a sitting or lying position, difficulty climbing stairs, changes to overall posture, impaired breathing, and cadiomyopathy. Many children are unable to run rapidly or jump. The atrophied muscles, in particular the calf muscles (and, less commonly, muscles in the buttocks, shoulders, and arms), may be enlarged by an accumulation of fat and connective tissue, causing them to look larger and healthier than they actually are (called pseudohypertrophy). Bone thinning and scoliosis are common. Ultimately, independent ambulation is lost, and a wheelchair becomes necessary, in most cases between 12 to 15 years of age. As the disease progresses, the muscles in the diaphragm that assist in breathing and coughing become weaker. Affected individuals experience breathing difficulties, respiratory infections, and swallowing problems. Almost all DMD patients will develop cardiomyopathy. Pneumonia compounded by cardiac involvement is the most frequent cause of death, which frequently occurs before the third decade.
      Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has less severe symptoms than DMD, but still leads to premature death. Compared to DMD, BMD is characterized by later-onset skeletal muscle weakness. Whereas DMD patients are wheelchair dependent before age 13, those with BMD lose ambulation and require a wheelchair after age 16. BMD patients also exhibit preservation of neck flexor muscle strength, unlike their counterparts with DMD. Despite milder skeletal muscle involvement, heart failure from DMD-associated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common cause of morbidity and the most common cause of death in BMD, which occurs on average in the mid-40s.
      Dystrophin is a cytoplasmic protein encoded by the dmd gene, and functions to link cytoskeletal actin filaments to membrane proteins. Normally, the dystrophin protein, located primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscles, with smaller amounts expressed in the brain, acts as a shock absorber during muscle fiber contraction by linking the actin of the contractile apparatus to the layer of connective tissue that surrounds each muscle fiber. In muscle, dystrophin is localized at the cytoplasmic face of the sarcolemma membrane.
      First identified in 1987, the dmd gene is the largest known human gene at approximately 2.5 Mb. The gene is located on the X chromosome at position Xp21 and contains 79 exons. The most common mutations that cause DMD or BMD are large deletion mutations of one or more exons (60-70%), but duplication mutations (5-10%), and single nucleotide variants, (including small deletions or insertions, single-base changes, and splice site changes accounting for approximately 25%-35% of pathogenic variants in males with DMD and about 10%-20% of males with BMD) can also cause pathogenic dystrophin variants.
      In DMD, mutations often lead to a frame shift resulting in a premature stop codon and a truncated, non-functional or unstable protein. Nonsense point mutations can also result in premature termination codons with the same result. While mutations causing DMD can affect any exon, exons 2-20 and 45-55 are common hotspots for large deletion and duplication mutations. In frame deletions result in the less severe Becker muscular dystrophy (BMB), in which patients express a truncated, partially functional dystrophin.
      Full-length dystrophin is a large (427 kDa) protein comprising a number of subdomains that contribute to its function. These subdomains include, in order from the amino-terminus toward the carboxy-terminus, the N-terminal actin-binding domain, a central so-called “rod” domain, a cysteine-rich domain and lastly a carboxy-terminal domain or region. The rod domain is comprised of 4 proline-rich hinge domains (abbreviated H), and 24 spectrin-like repeats (abbreviated R) in the following order: a first hinge domain (H1), 3 spectrin-like repeats (R1, R2, R3), a second hinge domain (H2), 16 more spectrin-like repeats (R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, R18, R19), a third hinge domain (H3), 5 more spectrin-like repeats (R20, R21, R22, R23, R24), and finally a fourth hinge domain (H4). Subdomains toward the carboxy-terminus of the protein are involved in connecting to the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC), a large protein complex that forms a critical link between the cytoskeleton and the extra-cellular matrix.
      No treatment definitively halts or reverses progression of DMD. Treatment with corticosteroids is the current standard of care, but this merely slows progression by a year or two. A number of new drugs for DMD have recently been approved by regulators. These include ataluren, which causes read-through of premature stop codons, and eteplirsen, which causes skipping of exon 51, generating an internally deleted partially functional dystrophin. However, the mechanism of action of these drugs is not expected to help all DMD patients, and further evidence is required to definitively demonstrate their clinical efficacy in DMD.
      With advances over the last 10-15 years in use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy to potentially treat a variety of rare diseases, there has been renewed hope and interest that AAV could be used to treat DMD and less severe dystrophinopathies (i.e., other muscle diseases associated with mutations in the dmd gene). Due to limits on payload size of AAV vectors, attention has focused on creating micro- or mini-dystrophins, smaller versions of dystrophin that eliminate non-essential subdomains while maintaining at least some function of the full-length protein. AAV-mediated mini-dystrophin gene therapy has shown promise in mdx mice, an animal model for DMD, with widespread expression in muscle and evidence of improved muscle function (See, e.g., Wang et al., J. Orthop. Res. 27:421 (2009)). When related experiments using a micro-dystrophin vector were attempted in the GRMD DMD dog model, however, powerful immunosuppressant drugs were required to achieve significant transduction of muscle cells (Yuasa et al., Gene Ther. 14:1249 (2007)). Similarly, when human DMD patients were treated with AAV vectors designed to express a mini-dystrophin, minimal protein was detected in only two of the six patients, whereas a T-cell response against the mini-dystrophin protein was stimulated in three (Bowles, et al., Mol Ther. 20(2):443-455 (2012)).
      Thus, there exists a need in the art for AAV vectors encoding mini-dystrophins that can be expressed at high levels in transduced cells of subjects with DMD while minimizing immune responses to the mini-dystrophin protein.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002698969,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The demand for cost efficient production processes has led to the necessity of optimization of the downstream purification, including one or more affinity chromatography steps. Larger volumes to be processed and harder requirements for the cleaning-in-place (CIP) protocols are some of the features that need to be solved (Hober, S., J. Chrom. B. 848 (2007) 40-47).
      The purification of monoclonal antibodies by means of selective Fc-region affinity ligands is the most promising methodology for the large-scale production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. In fact, this procedure does not require establishing any interaction with the antigen specific part of the antibody, i.e. the Fab domain, which is, thus, left intact and can retain its properties (see Salvalaglio, M., et al., J. Chrom. A 1216 (2009) 8678-8686).
      Due to its selectiveness, an affinity-purification step is employed early in the purification chain and thereby the number of successive unit operations can be reduced (see Hober supra; MacLennan, J., Biotechnol. 13 (1995) 1180; Harakas, N. K., Bioprocess Technol. 18 (1994) 259).
      The ligands most adopted to bind selectively IgG are Staphylococcal protein A and protein G, which are able to establish highly selective interactions with the Fc-region of most IgGs in a region known as “consensus binding site” (CBS) (DeLano, W. L., et al., Science 287 (2000) 1279), which is located at the hinge region between the CH2 and CH3 domains of the Fc-region.
      Staphylococcal protein A (SPA) is a cell wall associated protein domain exposed on the surface of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. SPA has high affinity to IgG from various species, for instance human, rabbit and guinea pig IgG but only weak interaction with bovine and mouse IgG (see the following Table) (see Hober supra; Duhamel, R. C., et al., J. Immunol. Methods 31 (1979) 211; Björk, L. and Kronvall, G., Immunol. J. 133 (1984) 969; Richman, D. D., et al., J. Immunol. 128 (1982) 2300; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Handbook, Antibody Purification (2000)).
      The heavy chain hinge-region between the CH2 and CH3 domains of IgG is able to bind several proteins beyond protein A, such as the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (see DeLano and Salvalaglio supra).
      The SPA CBS comprehends a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the antibody. The residues composing the IgG CBS are Ile 253, Ser 254, Met 252, Met 423, Tyr 326, His 435, Asn 434, His 433, Arg 255 and Glu 380 (numbering of the IgG heavy chain residues according to the Kabat EU index numbering system). The charged amino acids (Arg 255, Glu 380) are placed around a hydrophobic knob formed by Ile 253 and Ser 254. This (can) result in the establishment of polar and hydrophilic interactions (see Salvalaglio supra).
      In general, the protein A-IgG interaction can be described using two main binding sites: the first is positioned in the heavy chain CH2 domain and is characterized by hydrophobic interactions between Phe 132, Leu 136, Ile 150 (of protein A) and the IgG hydrophobic knob constituted by Ile 253 and Ser 254, and by one electrostatic interaction between Lys 154 (protein A) and Thr 256 (IgG). The second site is located in the heavy chain CH3 domain and is dominated by electrostatic interactions between Gln 129 and Tyr 133 (protein A) and His 433, Asn 434, and His 435 (IgG) (see Salvalaglio supra).
      Lindhofer, H., et al. (J. Immunol. 155 (1995) 219-225) report preferential species-restricted heavy/light chain pairing in rat/mouse quadromas.
      Jedenberg, L., et al. (J. Immunol. Meth. 201 (1997) 25-34) reported that SPA-binding analyses of two Fc variants (Fc13 and Fc31, each containing an isotypic dipeptide substitution from the respective other isotype) showed that Fc1 and Fc31 interact with SPA, while Fc3 and Fc13 lack detectable SPA binding. The rendered SPA binding of the Fc-region variant Fc31 is concluded to result from the introduced dipeptide substitution R435H and F436Y.
      Today, the focus with respect to therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is on the generation and use of bispecific or even multispecific antibodies specifically binding to two or more targets (antigens).
      The basic challenge in generating multispecific heterodimeric IgG antibodies from four antibody chains (two different heavy chains and two different light chains) in one expression cell line is the so-called chain association issue (see Klein, C., et al., mAbs 4 (2012) 653-663). The required use of different chains as the left and the right arm of the multispecific antibody leads to antibody mixtures upon expression in one cell: the two heavy chains are able to (theoretically) associate in four different combinations (two thereof are identical), and each of those can associate in a stochastic manner with the light chains, resulting in 2 4 (=a total of 16) theoretically possible chain combinations. Of the 16 theoretically possible combinations ten can be found of which only one corresponds to the desired functional bispecific antibody (De Lau, W. B., et al., J. Immunol. 146 (1991) 906-914). The difficulties in isolating this desired bispecific antibody out of complex mixtures and the inherent poor yield of 12.5% at a theoretical maximum make the production of a bispecific antibody in one expression cell line extremely challenging.
      To overcome the chain association issue and enforce the correct association of the two different heavy chains, in the late 1990s Carter et al. from Genentech invented an approach termed “knobs-into-holes” (KiH) (see Carter, P., J. Immunol. Meth. 248 (2001) 7-15; Merchant, A. M., et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 16 (1998) 677-681; Zhu, Z., et al., Prot. Sci. 6 (1997) 781-788; Ridgway, J. B., et al., Prot. Eng. 9 (1996) 617-621; Atwell, S., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 270 (1997) 26-35; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,183,076). Basically, the concept relies on modifications of the interface between the two CH3 domains of the two heavy chains of an antibody where most interactions occur. A bulky residue is introduced into the CH3 domain of one antibody heavy chain and acts similarly to a key (“knob”). In the other heavy chain, a “hole” is formed that is able to accommodate this bulky residue, mimicking a lock. The resulting heterodimeric Fc-region can be further stabilized by the introduction/formation of artificial disulfide bridges. Notably, all KiH mutations are buried within the CH3 domains and not “visible” to the immune system. In addition, properties of antibodies with KiH mutations such as (thermal) stability, FcγR binding and effector functions (e.g., ADCC, FcRn binding) and pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior are not affected.
      Correct heavy chain association with heterodimerization yields above 97% can be achieved by introducing six mutations: S354C, T366W in the “knob” heavy chain and Y349C, T366S, L368A, Y407V in the “hole” heavy chain (see Carter supra; numbering of the residues according to the Kabat EU index numbering system). While hole-hole homodimers may occur, knob-knob homodimers typically are not observed. Hole-hole dimers can either be depleted by selective purification procedures or by procedures as outlined below.
      While the issue of random heavy chain association has been addressed, also correct light chain association has to be ensured. Similar to the KiH CH3 domain approach, efforts have been undertaken to investigate asymmetric light chain-heavy chain interactions that might ultimately lead to full bispecific IgGs.
      Roche recently developed the CrossMab approach as a possibility to enforce correct light chain pairing in bispecific heterodimeric IgG antibodies when combining it with the KiH technology (see Klein supra; Schaefer. W., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108 (2011) 11187-11192; Cain, C., SciBX 4 (2011) 1-4). This allows the generation of bispecific or even multispecific antibodies in a generic fashion. In this format, one arm of the intended bispecific antibody is left untouched. In the second arm, the whole Fab region, or the VH-VL domains or the CH1-CL domains are exchanged by domain crossover between the heavy and light chain. As a consequence, the newly formed “crossed” light chain does not associate with the (normal, i.e. not-crossed) heavy chain Fab region of the other arm of the bispecific antibody any longer. Thus, the correct “light chain” association can be enforced by this minimal change in domain arrangement (see Schaefer supra).
      Zhu et al. introduced several sterically complementary mutations, as well as disulfide bridges, in the two VL/VH interfaces of diabody variants. When the mutations VL Y87A/F98M and VH V37F/L45W were introduced into the anti-p185HER2 VL/VH interface, a heterodimeric diabody was recovered with >90% yield while maintaining overall yield and affinity compared with the parental diabody (see Zhu supra).
      Researchers from Chugai have similarly designed bispecific diabodies by introduction of mutations into the VH-VL interfaces (mainly conversion of Q39 in VH and Q38 in VL to charged residues) to foster correct light chain association (WO 2006/106905; Igawa, T., et al., Prot. Eng. Des. Sel. 23 (2010) 667-677).
      In WO2011097603 a common light chain mouse is reported.
      In WO2010151792 a bispecific antibody format providing ease of isolation is provided, comprising immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domains that are differentially modified, i.e. heterodimeric, in the CH3 domain, wherein the differential modifications are non-immunogenic or substantially non-immunogenic with respect to the CH3 modifications, and at least one of the modifications results in a differential affinity for the bispecific antibody for an affinity reagent such as protein A, and the bispecific antibody is isolable from a disrupted cell, from medium, or from a mixture of antibodies based on its affinity for protein A.
      The neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) is important for the metabolic fate of antibodies of the IgG class in vivo. The FcRn functions to salvage IgG from the lysosomal degradation pathway, resulting in reduced clearance and increased half-life. It is a heterodimeric protein consisting of two polypeptides: a 50 kDa class I major histocompatibility complex-like protein (α-FcRn) and a 15 kDa β2-microglobulin (β2m). FcRn binds with high affinity to the CH2-CH3 portion of the Fc-region of an antibody of the class IgG. The interaction between an antibody of the class IgG and the FcRn is pH dependent and occurs in a 1:2 stoichiometry, i.e. one IgG antibody molecule can interact with two FcRn molecules via its two heavy chain Fc-region polypeptides (see e.g. Huber, A. H., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 230 (1993) 1077-1083).
      Thus, the in vitro FcRn binding properties/characteristics of an IgG are indicative of its in vivo pharmacokinetic properties in the blood circulation.
      In the interaction between the FcRn and the Fc-region of an antibody of the IgG class different amino acid residues of the heavy chain CH2- and CH3-domain are participating.
      Different mutations that influence the FcRn binding and therewith the half-life in the blood circulation are known. Fc-region residues critical to the mouse Fc-region-mouse FcRn interaction have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis (see e.g. Dall'Acqua, W. F., et al. J. Immunol 169 (2002) 5171-5180). Residues I253, H310, H433, N434 and H435 (numbering according to Kabat EU index numbering system) are involved in the interaction (Medesan, C., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 26 (1996) 2533-2536; Firan, M., et al., Int. Immunol. 13 (2001) 993-1002; Kim, J. K., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 24 (1994) 542-548). Residues I253, H310, and H435 were found to be critical for the interaction of human Fc-region with murine FcRn (Kim, J. K., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 29 (1999) 2819-2885).
      Methods to increase Fc-region (and likewise IgG) binding to FcRn have been performed by mutating various amino acid residues in the Fc-region: Thr 250, Met 252, Ser 254, Thr 256, Thr 307, Glu 380, Met 428, His 433, and Asn 434 (see Kuo, T. T., et al., J. Clin. Immunol. 30 (2010) 777-789; Ropeenian, D. C., et al., Nat. Rev. Immunol. 7 (2007) 715-725).
      The combination of the mutations M252Y, S254T, T256E have been described by Dall'Acqua et al. to improve FcRn binding by protein-protein interaction studies (Dall'Acqua, W. F., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 281 (2006) 23514-23524). Studies of the human Fc-region-human FcRn complex have shown that residues I253, S254, H435 and Y436 are crucial for the interaction (Firan, M., et al., Int. Immunol. 13 (2001) 993-1002; Shields, R. L., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276 (2001) 6591-6604). In Yeung, Y. A., et al. (J. Immunol. 182 (2009) 7667-7671) various mutants of residues 248 to 259 and 301 to 317 and 376 to 382 and 424 to 437 have been reported and examined.
      In WO 2014/006217 dimeric proteins with triple mutations are reported. Crystal structure at 2.8 Angstrom of an FcRn/heterodimeric Fc complex regarding the mechanism of pH-dependent binding was reported by Martin, W., et al. (Mol. Cell. 7 (2001) 867-877). In U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375, immunoglobulin like domains with increased half-lives are reported. Shields, R. L., et al., reported high resolution mapping of the binding site on human IgG1 for Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, Fc gamma RIII, and FcRn and design of IgG1 variants with improved binding to the Fc gamma R (Biochem. Mol. Biol. 276 (2001) 6591-6604). The delineation of the amino acid residues involved in transcytosis and catabolism of mouse IgG1 was reported by Medesan, C., et al. (J. Immunol. 158 (1997) 2211-2217). In US 2010/0272720 antibody fusion proteins with a modified FcRn binding site are reported. The production of heterodimeric proteins is reported in WO 2013/060867. Qiao, S.-W., et al. reported the dependence of antibody-mediated presentation of antigen on FcRn (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105 (2008) 9337-9342.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002768043,"BACKGROUND
      Schwann cells (hereinafter, also abbreviated as SCs) or neurolemmocytes are the principal glia cells of the peripheral nervous system. Glia cells function to support neurons and in the peripheral nervous system, include satellite cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, enteric glia cells, glia cells that reside at sensory nerve endings, such as the Pacinian corpuscle, and the like.
      In myelinated axons, Schwann cells form the myelin sheath. The sheath is not continuous, and individual Schwann cells wrap around about 100 μm of an axon. The gaps between adjacent Schwann cells are called nodes of Ranvier. The vertebrate nervous system is insulated with the myelin sheath to maintain the membrane capacitance of the axon. The action potential jumps from node to node of the nodes of Ranvier. Through this process, conduction velocity increases up to 10 times, without an increase in axonal diameter, and energy may be saved. Schwann cells may be the analogues of the oligodendrocytes which play the same role in the central nervous system. However, unlike oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells form the myelin sheath in only one axon.
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, which is a hereditary disease, is a disease in which the muscles of the limbs gradually shrink due to the abnormalities of Schwann cells forming the myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system. Among types thereof, Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) is one of the genetic diseases most frequently occurring in the peripheral nervous system, and there is such a big difference in genetic information between human and animal models for finding out the genetic causes of CMT1A and a solution to CMT1A with information obtained from animal models that there are problems in matching.
      CMT1A accounts for more than half of all CMT cases and about 70% of CMT1 cases, and the incidence of CMT is 1/2,500. CMT1A exhibits pathological characteristics such as muscle weakness and loss, decreased reflexes, acroparesthesia, dysmelia, a reduction in nerve conduction viscosity (NCV), hypertrophic segmental demyelination, and remyelination which appears like onion bulbs.
      Currently, there is no fundamental therapeutic agent or therapeutic method for diseases caused by the dysfunction of Schwann cells, such as CMT1A. There is only a method for partially reducing the aggravation of symptoms using physical therapy, orthopedic aids, and orthopedic surgery. Therefore, there is a great need for developing a fundamental therapeutic method for a disease caused by the dysfunction of Schwann cells.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002469091,"BACKGROUND
      In this application the interferon (IFN) nomenclature published in Nature (1) has been adopted.
      Human interferons (HuIFNs), which were discovered by Isaacs and Lindenmann in 1957 (2), are a well-known family of cytokines secreted by a large variety of eukaryotic cells upon exposure to various stimuli, such as viral infection or mitogen exposure. IFNs can elicit many changes in cellular behavior, including effects on cellular growth and differentiation and modulation of the immune system (3-7). HuIFNs have been classified into six subgroups, namely IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ. IFN-ω, IFN-ε and IFN-κ. HuIFN-α (leukocyte-derived interferon) is produced in human leukocyte cells and, together with minor amounts of HuIFN-β (fibroblast-derived interferon), in lymphoblastoid cells. HuIFNs have been further classified by their chemical and biological characteristics into two general categories, namely Type I and Type II. Type I consists of the IFN-α and INF-β subgroups as well as the recently discovered IFN-ω, IFN-ε and IFN-κ subgroups. Type II has only has one member: IFN-γ (immune interferon).
      The different interferon subgroups have different structural and biological characteristics. HuIFN-β is an N-linked glycoprotein (8, 9) which has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. It is heterogeneous in regard to size, presumably due to its carbohydrate moiety. However, there is only one human IFN-β gene, which encodes a protein of 166 amino acids. IFN-β has low homology to IFN-α, sharing about 30-40% identity.
      In contrast to the singleness of the IFN-β gene, HuIFN-α is a subgroup, consisting of a multigene family of 14 genes in essence. Minor variants made of one or two amino acid differences account for the multiple alleles (10). Excluding the pseudogene IFNAP22, there are 13 genes, encoding 13 proteins. Each protein comprises 165-166 amino acids. The protein encoded by gene IFNA13 is identical to protein IFNA1. Thus there are 12 individual interferon alpha proteins: IFNA1, IFNA2, IFNA4, IFNA5, IFNA6, IFNA7, IFNA8, IFNA10, IFNA14, IFNA16. IFNA17, and IFNA21. Amino acid sequence identity among IFN-α subtypes has generally 80-85% homology (11).
      Mature IFN-ω shows 60% nucleotide sequence homology to the family of IFN-α species but is longer by 6 amino acids at its C-terminal. IFN-ω is more distantly related to interferon-β (shares about 30% sequence homology). Human IFN-ω is not classified in the IFN-α group because it is antigenically distinct from IFN-α and differs in its interaction with the Type I IFN-α receptor (12). IFN-ω is secreted by virus-infected leukocytes as a major component of human leukocyte interferons.
      The mature protein of human IFN-ε contains 185-amino acids, sharing about 33% and 37% sequence homology to IFN-α2 and IFN-β respectively (13, 14). The function and biophysical properties of IFN-ε have not been characterized significantly in detail; however, it functions like Type I interferons. IFN-ε may also play a role in reproductive function (15).
      IFN-κ, a 180 amino acid human cytokine, is a recently identified Type I IFN. The coding sequence of IFN-κ is ˜30% identical to the other Type I interferons found in humans. A distinguishing feature of IFN-κ is the detectable constitutive expression of its transcript in uninduced cells, particularly keratinocytes. IFN-κ may play a role in the regulation of systemic or local immune functions through its effect on cells of the innate immune system (16). However, IFN-κ exhibits low anti-viral activity (17).
      Human Type I interferon appears to bind to two-receptor subunits, IFNAR-1 and -2, which are widely distributed on the cell surface of various cell types. Ligand involvement leads to the induction of the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases TYK2 and JAK-1, which are coupled to IFNAR-1 and -2 respectively. Once phosphorylated, STAT proteins are released from the receptor and form homodimers as well as heterodimers (18, 19). Once released, the dimers of STATA associate with interferon Responsive Factor 9 (IRF-9), a DNA binding protein, forming a complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF-3), that migrates into the nucleus. Next, the ISGF-3 complex binds to a DNA element existing in the upstream of all IFN inducible genes. This is the so-called “classical” signal transduction pathway.
      New modes of action and biochemical pathways regulated by Type I IFNs are continually being discovered. For example, downstream of PI3K in the signal transduction pathway, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) and PKC-d, are associated with anti-apoptotic effects observed in neutrophils incubated with IFN-β (20).
      More than 300 genes, called interferon induced genes, are responsive to the IFN treatment. The most studied IFN proteins are those with anti-viral properties. For example, the enzyme of the 2,5oligosynthetase family (OAS-1 and -2) catalyzes the synthesis of short oligoadenylates, which bind and activate RNAseL, an enzyme that cleaves viral and celluar RNAs, thus inhibiting protein synthesis. DsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2a, also resulting in the inhibition of viral and cellular protein syntheses. More recently, PKR was also was found to be required for the activation of transcription factor NF-κB, a central actor in inflammatory cytokine induction, immune modulation, and apoptosis. Mx (myxovirus-resistance) proteins inhibit the replication of the RNA viruses by either preventing transport of viral particles within the cell, or transcription of viral RNA. RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) converts adensine to inosine, thus causing hypermutation of viral RNA genomes (21).
      HuIFNs possess a broad spectrum of biological activities including anti-virus, anti-tumor, and immunoregulation functions. The clinical potentials of human interferons have been widely explored, and are summarized below.
      With respect to anti-tumor applications, HuIFNs may mediate anti-tumor effects either indirectly by regulating immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic responses or by directly affecting proliferation or cellular differentiation of tumor cells (22). Interferon therapy has been used in the treatment of various leukemias (23), for instance, hairy cell leukemia (24), acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (25-27), osteosarcoma (28), basal cell carcinoma (29), glioma (30), renal cell carcinoma (31), multiple myeloma (32), melanoma (33), Kaposi's sarcoma (23) and Hodgkin's disease (34). Combination therapy of IFN-α with cytarabine (ara-C), 5-FU, hydroxyura and IL-2 are well studied, mostly showing significantly better results than the HuIFN-α alone (3). Synergistic treatment of advanced cancer with a combination of HuIFNs and temozolomide has also been reported (35).
      With respect to anti-virus applications, HuIFNs have been used clinically for anti-viral therapy, for example, in the treatment of AIDS (36), viral hepatitis including chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis C (37, 38), papilloma virus infection (39), herpes virus infection (40), viral encephalitis (41), and in the prophylaxis of rhinitis and respiratory infections (40).
      HuIFNs have also been used clinically for anti-bacterial therapy (42), for example, aerosolized HuIFN-γ (43) and HuIFN-α have been used in patients with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (44). HuIFN-γ has been used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis of the brain (45).
      HuIFNs have also been used clinically for immunomodulation therapy, for example, to prevent graft vs. host rejection, or to curtail the progression of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (46, 47) and Sjogren's syndrome (48). IFN-β is approved by FDA in the United States for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Recently it has been reported that patients with multiple sclerosis have diminished production of Type I interferons and interleukin-2 (49). In addition, immunomodulation therapy with HuIFN-α seems to be an effective therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients relapsing after born marrow transplantation (50).
      With regard to vaccine adjuvantation, HuIFNs has been used clinically as an adjuvant in the treatment of melanoma (51) and may also be used as an adjuvant or coadjuvant to enhance or simulate the immune response in cases of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination for many other diseases (52).
      HuIFN-α2α was the first angiogenesis inhibitor to be used in clinical trials and was effective in children for the treatment of life-threatening hemangiomas (53, 54). Another clinical indication is giant-cell tumor of the bone. Kaban et al. reported the dramatic regression of a large, rapidly growing, recurrent giant-cell tumor of the mandible (55).
      Although HuIFNs have many important clinical applications, they do exhibit significant side effects and other limitations. Most cytokines, including HuIFNs, have relatively short circulation half-lives since they are produced in vivo to act locally and transiently. Since they are typically administered as systemic therapeutics, HuIFNs need to be administered frequently and in relatively large doses. Frequent parenteral administrations are inconvenient and painful. Further, toxic side effects associated with HuIFNs administration are often so severe that some people cannot tolerate the treatment. These side effects are probably associated with systemic administration of high dosages. Further, in clinical studies it has been found that some patients produce antibodies to rHuIFN, which neutralizes its biological activity (56).
      Clearly, development of novel interferon proteins with enhanced potency is urgently needed for numerous applications, e.g., anti-cancer therapies, as well as anti-viral, immunotherapy, anti-parasitic, anti-bacterial, or any medical condition or situation where increased interferon activity and/or reduced side effects is required. Overall, it is highly likely that HuIFNs will play a major role in the next generation of novel anti-tumor and anti-viral therapies (10).
      It is well know in the art that the most efficient means to improve the pharmaceutical properties of cytokine drugs is to mutate the cytokine protein itself. Various strategies and techniques to mutate interferon peptides have evolved over time. Generally, three strategies are currently used to create HuIFN-α mutants.
      The first strategy is to make IFN hybrids. Some researchers have taken advantage of the presence of naturally occurring restriction endonuclease (RE) cleavage sites within IFN-encoding sequences to piece together homologous coding fragments (57, 58). The production of a number of hybrid IFNs has been reviewed by Horisberger and Di Marco (11); this article provides an overview of the process of construction of such molecules. Specific examples of methods for the construction of hybrid interferons are described. Some researchers have taken the advantage of PCR amplification to construct mutant IFN-αs to thereby create specifically-desired nucleic acid fragments and then gain the potential of piecing together new pieces of different IFNs (59). U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,933 (60) also describes PCR amplification techniques to make human IFN hybrids. The interferon hybrids may be created within an interferon subgroup, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,720 (61) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,933 (60) or among at least two different interferon classification groups, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,996 (62) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,685,933 (60). In addition, the parent genes of the hybrid may come from one species (mostly from human), for example, hybrids between HuIFN-α and HuIFN-ω, or from more than one animal species, for instance, hybrids between human and murine interferon-αs (63).
      A second strategy to construct interferon mutants is to use site-directed point mutagenesis by introducing changes of one or more nucleotides into IFN DNA molecules (64). Recently, systematic mutation and computational methods are used as a guide for protein mutagenesis (65).
      A third strategy for the construction of Type I HuIFNs is to shuffle IFN gene fragments which are created by RE digestion, PCR amplification, chemically synthesis or DNase digestion, followed by PCR to randomly piece the fragments together and then amplify them. The resulting PCR products are in fact a pool of rearranged interferon alpha gene fragments which may be used to construct a DNA library, from which DNA clones with desired phenotypes may be isolated (66). For example, Chang et al have described a method for constructing and screening a HuIFN shuffling library to identify HuIFN derivates with increased anti-viral and antiproliferation activities in mouse cells (67).
      Human Interferon alfacon-1 (consensus interferon) is a recombinant non-naturally occurring HuIFN-α with 166 amino acids. It has been generated by assessing the most highly conserved amino acids in each corresponding region based on the known cloned HuIFN-α sequences. It has 89% sequence homology at amino acid level to HuIFN-α2b and a specific anti-viral activity of approximately 10 9 IU/mg. Human Interferon alfacon-1 has approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients 18 years or older with compensated liver disease (68).
      Although some recombinant interferon proteins are known in the prior art, there is a need for new interferon-like proteins and protein compositions having enhanced biological activities.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200600570,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Light-emitting devices are used in many applications including optical communication systems. Optical communication systems have been in existence for some time and continue to increase in use due to the large amount of bandwidth available for transporting signals. Optical communication systems provide high bandwidth and superior speed and are suitable for efficiently communicating large amounts of voice and data over long distances. Optical communication systems that operate at relatively long wavelengths on the order of 1.2 micrometers (μm) to 1.6 μm are generally preferred because optical fibers generally have their lowest attenuation in this wavelength range. These long wavelength optical communication systems include a light source capable of emitting light at a relatively long wavelength. Such a light source is a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), although other types of light sources are also available.
       VCSELs are generally characterized by a pair of mirrors, generally referred to as distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), between which an optical cavity is located. The entire structure can be formed over a substrate wafer by a process called organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMVPE), sometimes referred to as metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The optical cavity generally also includes spacer layers and an active region. The active region typically includes one or more quantum wells. The quantum wells, which typically include a quantum well layer sandwiched by a pair of adjacent barrier layers, are the layers into which carriers, i.e., electrons and holes, are injected. The electrons and holes recombine in the active region and emit light at a wavelength determined by the material layers in the quantum well. The quantum well layer typically comprises a low bandgap semiconductor material, while the barrier layers typically have a bandgap higher than the bandgap of the quantum well layers. In this manner, when the device is subject to forward bias, electrons and holes are injected into and trapped in the quantum well layer and recombine to emit coherent light at a particular wavelength.
       The spacer layers separate the active region from the DBRs. The DBRs are formed using alternating layers of materials that have different refractive indices. The reflectivity of the DBRs is determined by the refractive index of the materials of the layers constituting the layer pairs, with one DBR being slightly less reflective than the other. The light generated in the active region is emitted from the VCSEL through the less reflective DBR.
       VCSELs having multiple active regions have also been produced. The number of active regions in a VCSEL determines the threshold gain of the VCSEL. Before light is emitted from a VCSEL, many losses inherent in the VCSEL have to be overcome. Losses in a VCSEL are created by the mirrors, diffraction, and distributed losses. Losses in the mirrors are due to the mirror reflectivity being less than 100%. Indeed, if the mirrors were 100% reflective, light could not be emitted form the VCSEL. Diffraction losses are caused when the emitted light expands as it propagates away from a guiding aperture in the VCSEL. Distributed losses are caused by scattering and by absorption of light in the VCSEL structure.
       To overcome some of these losses, optically-pumped VCSELs may include multiple active regions. Early optically-pumped VCSELs had three active regions, each having five quantum wells. The multiple quantum wells were used to overcome the scattering loss in the mirrors because the mirrors were constructed of dielectric layers with slightly rough surfaces. Generally, if the overall loss in the VCSEL can be minimized, fewer quantum wells are needed. Furthermore, high-temperature performance of the VCSEL can be improved (i.e., T zero can be increased) by using multiple quantum wells.
       However, in a VCSEL there is a limit to the number of quantum wells that can fit under one maximum of the standing wave that exists in the optical cavity. If too many quantum wells are added, the outer quantum wells do not coincide with the optical mode of the standing wave, and the quantum wells do not fully contribute to the modal gain of the VCSEL. To overcome this, the multiple quantum wells can be arranged in what is referred to as a resonant periodic gain (RPG) structure. An RPG structure includes two or more active regions, with the active regions lying under adjacent maxima in the standing wave. This RPG structure is used to maximize the optical gain of VCSELs in which the threshold gain (i.e., the gain to overcome all losses) of the VCSEL is relatively high.
       In a particular implementation of a VCSEL, one of the DBRs is movably arranged so that the output wavelength of the VCSEL can be adjusted. Such a VCSEL is referred to as a tunable VCSEL. As known in the art, one of the mirrors is located over a cavity spacer layer and can be moved by an electrostatic motor, thereby allowing the output wavelength of the VCSEL to be changed.
       Light is generated in the just-described tunable VCSEL by optical pumping. Optically-pumped long-wavelength tunable VCSELs generally have undoped material layers and use a high-power laser diode having an output of approximately 980 nanometers (nm) to generate carriers in the VCSEL's active regions. The carriers recombine in the active regions and the VCSEL emits light at the desired wavelength.
       One of the drawbacks of an optically-pumped VCSEL is the high complexity involved in aligning the output of the pumping laser diode with the VCSEL. Another drawback in some applications is that all of the active regions in the VCSEL are stimulated using the same light. Finally, the overall efficiency of an optically-pumped laser is lower than that of an electrically-pumped laser because an optically-pumped laser is generally larger and more costly than an electrically-pumped laser. An optically-pumped laser is larger because there are two devices, and more costly because the two devices must be carefully aligned with respect to one other.
       Electrically-pumped VCSELs include a p-i-n junction structure in which the intrinsic material that forms an active region is sandwiched between layers of p-type and n-type material. For optimal light emission, the active region should be located at a peak of the standing wave (the axial or longitudinal mode) generated in the optical cavity. However, in a VCSEL having multiple active regions, each of the active regions is separated by several hundred nanometers. In a VCSEL that includes a single p-i-n junction, there is no conventional solution for electrically injecting carriers uniformly from the single p-i-n junction into the multiple active regions.
       As mentioned above, multiple active regions are used in an optically-pumped VCSEL to overcome losses and lower the laser threshold current, i.e., the minimum current through the pumping laser at which light is generated by the VCSEL. The multiple quantum wells are placed under adjacent maxima in the standing wave. These maxima lie exactly ½-wavelength apart within the cavity assuming a cavity thickness greater than one-wavelength. For example, assume a cavity thickness of 2, 3 or n-λ, where λ is the wavelength of the emitted light in the material of the cavity. At a wavelength of 1.5 μm and a refractive index of 3.5, the two adjacent active regions are separated by >200 nm. Assuming there are two active regions, and the p-i-n junction is located around one of them, the other active region lies >200 nm from the p-i-n junction. The number of electrons and holes injected into the distant active region will be lower than the number injected into the active region closer to the p-i-n junction. Generally, a single p-i-n junction cannot uniformly excite two separate active regions. The homogeneity of the injected carrier density is better if the active regions are closer together. However, in a VCSEL, the internal intensity profile of the longitudinal optical mode dictates the spacing of the active regions. Therefore, a VCSEL structure prevents uniform pumping of multiple active regions with a single junction.
       The parameters characterizing the non-homogeneity of electrically pumping multiple active regions with a single p-i-n junction are the ½-wavelength spacing distance between the active regions, which is determined by the wavelength, the refractive index, and the minority-carrier diffusion lengths. The minority-carrier diffusion length characterizes the distance from the p-i-n junction over which the injected carrier density decays. If the ½-wavelength spacing distance is more than a small fraction of the minority carrier diffusion length, the pumping of multiple active regions with a single p-i-n junction will be non-homogeneous.
       Therefore, an effective electrically-pumped alternative to an optically-pumped, VCSEL having multiple active regions is desirable.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       The invention provides several embodiments of an electrically-pumped VCSEL having multiple active regions. The invention allows the active regions to be pumped electrically and to be located at the maxima of the standing wave in the optical cavity.
       In one embodiment, the invention is an electrically-pumped vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL), comprising a pair of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), an optical cavity located between the DBRs, active regions located in the optical cavity, and p-i-n junction structures equal in number to the active regions. Each of the active regions constitutes the intrinsic (i) layer of a corresponding one of the p-i-n junction structures.
       Embodiments of the invention also provide an electrically-pumped, tunable VCSEL having a number of different p-i-n junction and electrode arrangements, which, in various embodiments, allow independent biasing of the multiple active regions, and, in other embodiments, allow simplified electrical connections.
       Other features and advantages in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing are provided by certain embodiments of the invention, as is apparent from the description below with reference to the following drawings.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200601738,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       There are many instances whereby the efficacy of a therapeutic protein is limited by an unwanted immune reaction to the therapeutic protein. Several mouse monoclonal antibodies have shown promise as therapies in a number of human disease settings but in certain cases have failed due to the induction of significant degrees of a human anti-murine antibody (HAMA) response [Schroff, R. W. et al (1985) Cancer Res. 45: 879-885; Shawler, D. L. et al (1985) J. Immunol. 135: 1530-1535]. For monoclonal antibodies, a number of techniques have been developed in attempt to reduce the HAMA response [WO 89/09622; EP 0239400; EP 0438310; WO 91/06667]. These recombinant DNA approaches have generally reduced the mouse genetic information in the final antibody construct whilst increasing the human genetic information in the final construct. Notwithstanding, the resultant “humanised” antibodies have, in several cases, still elicited an immune response in patients [Issacs J. D. (1990) Sem. Immunol. 2: 449, 456; Rebello, P. R. et al (1999) Transplantation 68: 1417-1420].
       The key to the induction of an immune response is the presence within the protein of peptides that can stimulate the activity of T-cells via presentation on MHC class II molecules, so-called “T-cell epitopes”. Such T-cell epitopes are commonly defined as any amino acid residue sequence with the ability to bind to MHC Class II molecules. Implicitly, a “T-cell epitope” means an epitope which when bound to MHC molecules can be recognized by a T-cell receptor (TCR), and which can, at least in principle, cause the activation of these T-cells by engaging a TCR to promote a T-cell response.
       MHC Class II molecules are a group of highly polymorphic proteins which play a central role in helper T-cell selection and activation. The human leukocyte antigen group DR (HLA-DR) are the predominant isotype of this group of proteins; however, isotypes HLA-DQ and HLA-DP perform similar functions. In the human population, individuals bear two to four DR alleles, two DQ and two DP alleles. The structure of a number of DR molecules has been solved and these appear as an open-ended peptide binding groove with a number of hydrophobic pockets which engage hydrophobic residues (pocket residues) of the peptide [Brown et al (1993) Nature 364: 33; Stern et al (1994) Nature 368: 215]. Polymorphism identifying the different allotypes of class II molecule contributes to a wide diversity of different binding surfaces for peptides within the peptide binding groove and at the population level ensures maximal flexibility with regard to the ability to recognize foreign proteins and mount an immune response to pathogenic organisms.
       An immune response to a therapeutic protein proceeds via the MHC class II peptide presentation pathway. Here exogenous proteins are engulfed and processed for presentation in association with MHC class II molecules of the DR, DQ or DP type. MHC Class II molecules are expressed by professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and dendritic cells amongst others. Engagement of a MHC class II peptide complex by a cognate T-cell receptor on the surface of the T-cell, together with the cross-binding of certain other co-receptors such as the CD4 molecule, can induce an activated state within the T-cell. Activation leads to the release of cytokines further activating other lymphocytes such as B cells to produce antibodies or activating T-killer cells as a full cellular immune response.
       T-cell epitope identification is the first step to epitope elimination as recognized in WO98/52976; WO00/34317; WO02/069232; WO02/079232; and WO02/079415. In these teachings, predicted T-cell epitopes are removed by the use of judicious amino acid substitution within the protein of interest. Besides computational techniques, there are in vitro methods for measuring the ability of synthetic peptides to bind MHC class II molecules. An exemplary method uses B-cell lines of defined MHC allotype as a source of MHC class II binding surface and may be applied to MHC class II ligand identification [Marshall K. W. et al. (1994) J. Immunol. 152:4946-4956; O'Sullivan et al (1990) J. Immunol. 145: 1799-1808; Robadey C. et al (1997) J. Immunol 159: 3238-3246]. However, such techniques are not adapted for the screening of multiple potential epitopes to a wide diversity of MHC allotypes, nor can they confirm the ability of a binding peptide to function as a T-cell epitope.
       Techniques exploiting soluble complexes of recombinant MHC molecules in combination with synthetic peptides have also come into use [Kern, F. et al (1998) Nature Medicine 4:975-978; Kwok, W. W. et al (2001) TRENDS in Immunol. 22:583-588]. These reagents and procedures are used to identify the presence of T-cell clones from peripheral blood samples from human or experimental animal subjects that are able to bind particular MHC-peptide complexes and are not adapted for screening multiple potential epitopes to a wide diversity of MHC allotypes.
       Biological assays of T-cell activation offer a practical option to providing a reading of the ability of a test peptide/protein sequence to evoke an immune response. Examples of this kind of approach include the work of Petra et al using T-cell proliferation assays to the bacterial protein staphylokinase, followed by epitope mapping using synthetic peptides to stimulate T-cell lines [Petra, A. M. et al (2002) J. Immunol. 168: 155-161]. Similarly, T-cell proliferation assays using synthetic peptides of the tetanus toxin protein have resulted in definition of immunodominant epitope regions of the toxin [Reece J. C. et al (1993) J. Immunol. 151: 6175-6184]. WO99/53038 discloses an approach whereby T-cell epitopes in a test protein may be determined using isolated sub-sets of human immune cells, promoting their differentiation in vitro and culture of the cells in the presence of synthetic peptides of interest and measurement of any induced proliferation in the cultured T-cells. The same technique is also described by Stickler et al. [Stickler, M. M. et al (2000) J. Immunotherapy 23:654-660], where in both instances the method is applied to the detection of T-cell epitopes within bacterial subtilisin. Such a technique requires careful application of cell isolation techniques and cell culture with multiple cytokine supplements to obtain the desired immune cell sub-sets (dendritic cells, CD4+ and or CD8+ T-cells) and is not conducive to rapid through-put screening using multiple donor samples.
       Recently a combination approach using population based T-cell proliferation assays and in silico simulation of peptide MHC binding in the design of epitope depleted proteins has also been advanced [WO 03/104803].
       As depicted above and as consequence thereof, it would be desirable to identify and to remove or at least to reduce T-cell epitopes from a principal therapeutically valuable but originally immunogenic peptide, polypeptide or protein.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002685956,"BACKGROUND
      Current methods of purifying a naturally-occurring or recombinant therapeutic protein from a solution comprising said protein usually carry at least some impurities into the final preparation. In some instances, the presence of impurities, such as proteases, will destabilise the therapeutic protein in solution, particularly during storage. For this reason, many therapeutic proteins are stored as lyophilized or frozen preparations.
      Whilst destabilising levels of impurities can affect many different types of therapeutic proteins, they are particularly relevant to those used for maintaining haemostasis. Haemostasis is an important physiological process that prevents bleeding following damage (e.g. a rupture) to blood vessels. There are three basic mechanisms that promote haemostasis: (i) vasoconstriction, (ii) platelet aggregation at the rupture site; and (iii) coagulation. During coagulation, damaged endothelial cells release tissue factor (Factor III), which in turn activates Factor VII with the aid of Ca 2+. Factor XII, which is released by activated platelets, activates Factor XI. Activated Factor VII and Factor XI promote a cascade of enzymatic reactions that lead to the activation of Factor X. Active Factor X (Factor Xa), along with Factor III, Factor V, Ca 2+, and platelet thromboplastic factor (PF 3), activate prothrombin activator. Prothrombin activator converts prothrombin to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen (Factor I) to fibrin, which forms an initial mesh over the site of damage. The initial mesh is then converted to a dense fibrin clot by Factor XIII, sealing the rupture until the site is repaired. During the coagulation cascade, thrombin will also activate Factor VIII, a glycoprotein pro-cofactor that in the circulation is mainly complexed to von Willebrand factor (VWF). Factor VIII interacts with Factor IXa to activate Factor X in the presence of Ca +2 and phospholipids.
      A deficiency in the level of any one or more of the proteins involved in coagulation, including fibrinogen, Factor VIII, and/or von Willebrand factor (VWF) whether congenital or acquired, can lead to insufficient clotting of blood and the risk of haemorrhage. Current treatment options are limited to the administration of a pharmaceutical preparation of one or more therapeutic proteins, with a view to restoring endogenous levels of said proteins and maintaining haemostasis. However, existing pharmaceutical preparations, which are typically derived from donated blood plasma or a recombinant source, comprise zymogens and proteases (e.g., prothrombin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and/or other proteases), which can destabilise the therapeutic proteins, such as fibrinogen, Factor VIII, or VWF during storage. As a consequence, such preparations are relatively unstable in aqueous solution, with long-term storage limited to lyophilized or frozen preparations.
      For clinical applications, fibrinogen is typically purified from human plasma, where it accounts for only about 2-5% (1.5-4.0 g/L) of total plasma proteins. Traditionally, the purification of fibrinogen from plasma is carried out by classical plasma fractionation, where fibrinogen is cryo-precipitated from plasma followed by precipitation with either ethanol, ammonium sulphate, β alanine/glycine, polymers (e.g., polyethelene glycol) or low ionic strength solutions. Such methods can achieve relative high yield and homogeneity. Where a greater level of purity is required, chromatographic techniques are often employed. However, existing precipitation and chromatographic techniques amenable to commercial scale manufacturing processes typically produce fibrinogen preparations that comprise contaminating proteins such as zymogens or proteases (e.g., prothrombin, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen), which can destabilize fibrinogen in solution. For example, when prothrombin is present, it can be activated to the serine protease thrombin which will in turn convert fibrinogen into fibrin. Similarly, when both tPA and plasminogen are present, tPA can activate plasminogen to its active form plasmin, which will in turn hydrolyse fibrinogen into fibrin. As a consequence, fibrinogen preparations are relatively unstable in aqueous solution, with long-term storage limited to lyophilized or frozen preparations.
      Specific contaminants can be absorbed out; for example, fibronectin on immobilised gelatine and plasminogen on immobilised lysine (Vuento et al. 1979, Biochem. J., 183(2):331-337). However, the use of specific affinity resins is not amenable to large scale commercial processes. Reasons for this include the affinity resins themselves not being sufficiently robust to be used repeatedly and generally add significantly to the both processing time and costs.
      EP1240200 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,960,463) is directed to methods of purifying fibrinogen from a fibrinogen-containing solution using ion exchange (IEX) chromatography. In particular the method involves applying a fibrinogen-containing solution to an ion exchange matrix under conditions that allow the fibrinogen to bind to the matrix and then washing the ion exchange matrix with a solution comprising at least one omega amino acid. This is done to promote the differential removal of plasminogen from the resin. Fibrinogen that is bound to the matrix is then eluted from the matrix.
      WO2012038410 provides a method of purifying fibrinogen using anion exchange resins which contain a hydroxylated polymer support grafted with tertiary or quaternary amines that bind fibrinogen.
      EP1519944 teaches the use of an immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography matrix under conditions that fibrinogen and plasminogen bind to the matrix, and selectively eluting the fibrinogen and plasminogen separately, such that the main fibrinogen fraction contains about 600 ng of plasminogen per mg of protein.
      The present invention provides a method of reducing the level of plasminogen and/or tissue plasminogen activator and/or other protease(s) in a solution comprising fibrinogen and/or Factor VIII and/or VWF. The purified protein(s) are stable during storage as liquid preparations and can be used for clinical or veterinary applications, including treating or preventing conditions associated with a deficiency in the level of said protein(s).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002606514,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged with histones to form chromatin. Approximately 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped twice around an octamer of histones (two each of histones 2A, 2B, 3, and 4) to form a nucleosome, the basic unit of chromatin. Changes in the ordered structure of chromatin can lead to alterations in transcription of associated genes. This process is highly controlled because changes in gene expression patterns can profoundly affect fundamental cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Control of changes in chromatin structure (and hence of transcription) is mediated by covalent modifications to histones, most notably of their N-terminal tails. These modifications are often referred to as epigenetic because they can lead to heritable changes in gene expression, but do not affect the sequence of the DNA itself. Covalent modifications (for example, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination) of the side chains of amino acids are enzymatically mediated.
      The selective addition of methyl groups to specific amino acid sites on histones is controlled by the action of a unique family of enzymes known as histone methyltransferases (HMTs). The level of expression of a particular gene is influenced by the presence or absence of a methyl group at a relevant histone site. The specific effect of a methyl group at a particular histone site persists until the methyl group is removed by a histone demethylase, or until the modified histone is replaced through nucleosome turnover. In a like manner, other enzyme classes can decorate DNA and histones with other chemical species and still other enzymes can remove these species to provide temporal control of gene expression.
      The orchestrated collection of biochemical systems behind transcriptional regulation must be tightly controlled in order for cell growth and differentiation to proceed optimally. Disease states result when these controls are disrupted by aberrant expression and/or activity of the enzymes responsible for DNA and histone modification. In human cancers, for example, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that dysregulated epigenetic enzyme activity contributes to the uncontrolled cell proliferation associated with cancer as well as other cancer-relevant phenotypes such as enhanced cell migration and invasion. Beyond cancer, there is growing evidence for a role of epigenetic enzymes in a number of other human diseases, including metabolic diseases (such as diabetes), inflammatory diseases (such as Crohn's disease), neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's disease) and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, selectively modulating the aberrant action of epigenetic enzymes holds great promise for the treatment of a range of diseases.
      There is an ongoing need for new agents which modulate the aberrant action of epigenetic enzymes. The present invention provides compounds that meet this need.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200601218,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Human respiratory Syncytial virus is classified in the genus Pneumovirus, family Paramyxoviruses. It is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants, the elderly and in immunocompromised individuals. It is also an important factor in upper respiratory tract disease in older children and adults. Currently there is no effective h-RSV vaccine available in the art.
      RSV is an enveloped RNA virus that expresses two major antigens at its surface: the attachment protein G and the fusion protein F. Both proteins appear to invoke protective antibodies. G is the determinant of the two known h-RSV subgroups A and B. Antigenic differences can be found within the two groups. The G protein shows a high degree of variation with only 53% amino acid homology between groups A and B and up to 20% differences in G protein sequences within group A (Mufson 1988, Cane 1991).
      Passive immunisation with RSV-enriched immunoglobulin (Respigam) or synthetic humanised monoclonal antibodies against F (Palivizumab) is currently used to treat and protect neonates of certain predispositions (e.g. premature birth) against RSV infection (Robinson 2000, Greenough 2000). RSV pathology has two major aspects: cell damage caused by the virus itself and tissue damage caused by the overreacting immune system. The latter is a highly complicating factor in vaccine design.
      RSV infections are seasonal, limited to the winter period and peak in the Northern Hemisphere around the end of the year. RSV infects every child before the age of two, in many cases twice. Older individuals on average are infected every other year, depending on the setting; people in close contact with infants and young children have a 50% risk. The virus spreads by close contact, in droplets or through contaminated surfaces. RSV is not efficiently spread through aerosols; the virus particles are relatively unstable. Internal spread of the virus from the upper respiratory tract (URT) to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) occurs predominantly by inhalation of virus particles produced in the URT epithelium during primary infection. Spread through syncytium formation (one of the pathological properties of the virus, which gave it its name) can not be ruled out and may play a secondary role in LRT infection.
      In general, RSV pathology starts in the URT; the port of entry is the nose and to a lesser extent the eyes—not the mouth. When restricted to URT tissues, disease is limited to common cold, although in adults sometimes severe. However, when the virus can reach the LRT, bronchiolitis and pneumonia can ensue in unprotected individuals. In young infants, this can be life threatening, approx. 1/100 will require hospitalisation and mechanical ventilation, out of these 1% may die. In the elderly, RSV-induced LRT disease is a major cause of hospitalisation; it is suspected that RSV causes 25% of flu-like diseases.
      The immune response to RSV is complex. In general, exposure to h-RSV will build up a response that protects against LRT disease. This response wanes with older age, causing the higher susceptibility to RSV of the older population. Effective long lasting protection against URT disease appears not feasible: re-infection is very common, even within the same season and this is not caused by viral variation. Protection against RSV infection involves antibodies against viral proteins F and G circulating in the blood, which can prevent LRT disease. URT infection can be controlled by mucosal antibodies against F and G, but these have a limited life span. CD8+ T cells against as yet unidentified viral proteins are required to clear the virus from infected tissues, but they appear to be short-lived or inefficiently recruited from their reservoirs. Most likely, this is caused by RSV-expressed factors, possibly encoded in the G gene (Srikiatkhachom, 1997a).
      An important aspect of RSV disease is immune enhancement of pathology. In limited cases the cellular immune response can exacerbate RSV disease by the action of cytokines on infected tissues released from excessively attracted granulocytes. Host predisposition is involved in this reaction, but possibly also the timing of first RSV infection after birth. Unfortunately, early vaccine trials with formalin-inactivated RSV showed that in these vaccination settings immune enhanced pathology upon wt infection was prevalent (Kim 1969). Factors contained in RSV appear to be responsible for this phenomenon and were apparently released by formalin treatment. In the 40 years since then, it was gradually shown that the viral G protein is the predominant mediator of these problems, but the mechanism remains unclear (Srikiatkhachom 1997b). In any case, vaccination with a G protein out of the context of the virion (i.e. in inactivated virus preparations, as expression product not properly embedded in a membrane or in the form of peptides) seems to be causing immune enhancement in model systems. Thus, although G contributes to some extent to RSV immunity, its properties also complicate vaccine design.
      Initial live RSV vaccine candidates included cold passaged or temperature-sensitive mutants. The former have been attenuated by culturing at decreasing temperature, leading to dependency on low temperatures for growth, whereas the latter mutants have been made dependent on a specific, usually higher temperature for replication by chemical or radiation mutagenesis. These live virus vaccine candidates appeared to be either under- or overattenuated (Crowe 1998).
      Subunit vaccine candidates are derived from either the RSV-F or the G protein, being the main targets for neutralising antibodies. A candidate subunit vaccine, PFP2, purified F protein, is safe in RSV-seropositive patients, but it did not provide full protection against LRT infection and associated disease (Gonzalez 2000). Another subunit vaccine approach is BBG2Na, which consists of a polypeptide, comprising amino acid 130-230 of h-RSV-G, fused to the albumin-binding domain of streptococcal G protein (Power 1997). BBG2Na induces a T helper type 2 response in neonatal mice, and does not elicit lung immunopathology (Siegrist 1999). There is no data yet on protection. The use of new adjuvants for a balanced humoral and cellular immune response are currently under investigation in animal models (Plotnicky 2003).
      The use of plasmid-DNA vectors encoding RSV-F and G antigens as vaccine candidates has been studied in animal models. These vaccines induce protective responses in rodents (Li 2000), but in one study RSV-F DNA vaccine candidate immunised mice developed a slightly enhanced pulmonary inflammatory response following challenge with wt virus (Bembridge 2000). The feasibility of the use of plasmid DNA vaccines in humans is not yet known and it will likely take at least 15 years before this approach is sufficiently studied and—more importantly—accepted, particularly for neonates. Candidate vaccines based on vector delivery systems are constructed of live recombinant vectors expressing RSV proteins. For example, recombinant vaccinia virus expressing RSV-F and G provided protection in mice, but lacked this effect in chimpanzees (Collins 1990). The question is whether these systems are safe (notably vaccinia virus) and feasible in the light of existing (maternal) antibodies against poxviruses in the community and the main target group being neonates.
      Several vaccine candidates are based on recombinant live RSV, generated by reverse genetics. One line of study focuses on attenuating these viruses by introducing the individual or combined mutations responsible for cold-adaptation and temperature-sensitivity into the recombinant virus. None of these vaccine candidates were usable, because of either over- or underattenuation. Another line of study focuses on deletion of one or more viral non-structural genes. Limited data are available on the behaviour of these viruses in model systems (Jin 2003).
      An alternative approach to RSV vaccine development is the use of bovine RSV. A chimeric bovine RSV with either the human F protein alone or both the human F and G protein was evaluated for its efficacy in chimpanzees. This vaccine candidate was restricted in replication to such a degree that animals were not protected after wild type h-RSV challenge (Buchholtz 2000).
      Thus, currently there is no effective h-RSV vaccine available in the art. All RSV vaccine candidates that have been tested in animal models are unusable in humans. There is thus a long felt need in the art for RSV vaccines that are both effective and safe and it is an object of the present invention to provide for such vaccines.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002725950,"BACKGROUND ART
      First-generation chemotherapeutic anti-cancer drugs and second-generation targeted anti-cancer drugs, which are widely used at present, have problems of side effects due to the toxicity of anticancer drugs, high risk of drug resistance and the limitation that they can be administered only to patients having specific gene mutations. Immune anticancer drugs (immuno-oncology drugs) called “third-generation anticancer drugs”, which overcome these problems, act on the signaling pathway of immune cells to activate immune cells and thereby attack cancer cells, thus providing therapeutic effects. Unlike conventional anticancer drugs, immune anticancer drugs can be applied to various diseases including cancer in a manner of treating diseases using the human immune system, and are reported to involve less side effects than conventional anticancer drugs.
      PD-1 (also referred to as “CD279”) is a 55 KD receptor protein associated with the CD28/CTLA4 co-stimulatory/inhibitory receptor family (Blank et al., 2005 Cancer Immunol Immunother 54: 307-314).
      The characteristics in mice and humans are examined by cloning the gene and the cDNA encoding PD-1 (Ishida et al., 1992 EMBO J 11:3887-3395; Shinohara et al., 1994 Genomics 23:704-706). Whole-length PD-1 contains 288 amino acid residues (NCBI accession number: NP 005009). The extracellular domain consists of amino acid residues 1-167 and the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail contains amino acid residues 191-288, which contain two hypothetical immune-regulatory motifs, that is, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM; Vivier et al., 1997 Immunol Today 18: 286-291) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine switch motif (ITSM; Chemnitz et al., 2004 J Immunol 173: 945-954).
      To date, two sequence-related ligands, PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC), have been known to specifically interact with PD-1 to induce intracellular signaling, and to inhibit CD3 and CD28-mediated T-cell activation (Riley, 2009 Immunol Rev 229: 114-125), which eventually regulates T-cell activity, for example, reduces secretion of other growth factors and cytokine, as well as cell growth, and secretion of IL-2 and IFN-γ.
      The expression of PD-1 is frequently found in immune cells such as T-cells, B-cells, mononuclear cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and is almost not expressed in other human tissues such as muscle, epithelium and nervous tissue. In addition, high levels of PD-1 expression are often associated with the activity of immune cells. For example, when the human T-cell line, Jurkat is activated by PHA (phytohaemagglutinin) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or TPA, the expression of PD-1 is up-regulated, as can be seen from Weston blotting. Due to stimulation of the anti-CD3 antibody, the same phenomenon was observed in stimulated mouse T- and B-lymphocytes, and primary human CD 4+ T cells. The increased PD-1 expression causes stimulation of effector T cells and guides the activated effector T cells to the direction of depleted and reduced immune activation. Thus, PD-1-mediated inhibitory signals are known to play a key role in immune tolerance.
      An increase in the expression of PD-1 of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) and the expression of PD-1 ligands in tumor cells has been reported in a variety of cancers and has been reported in other types of tissues and organs including the lungs, liver, stomach, breasts, ovaries, pancreas, melanocytes, and esophagus. More frequently, the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in such cancers is associated with a poor prognosis regarding patient survival results. The importance of PD-1 signaling on the regulation of the immune system for cancer removal or tolerance was described in more detail through transgenic mice that inhibit the growth of xenograft cancer cells by knocking out the PD-1 genes.
      Up-regulation of PD-1 signaling leads to immune-tolerant cancer proliferation as well as to human viral infection and metastasis. Pandemic hepatitis B virus, HBV and HCV induce over-expression of PD-1 ligands in hepatocytes and activate PD-1 signaling in effector T cells, leading to T-cell depletion and tolerance for viral infection. Similarly, HIV infection frequently evades the human immune system through a similar mechanism. PD-1 signaling can be therapeutically modulated by antagonistic molecules so that immune cells can be recovered from tolerance and can be reactivated to eliminate cancer and chronic viral infections.
      Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, which are monoclonal antibodies, are known as drugs targeting PD-1 and are used as therapeutic agents for malignant melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. However, it is reported that these drugs put a huge financial burden on patients due to high production cost and accurate verification thereof is required. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing new PD-1-targeting therapeutic agents that can overcome the limitations of conventional drugs.
      Under this technical background, the present inventors have made efforts to develop antibodies for treating cancer that specifically bind to PD-L1. As a result, the present inventors have developed an anti-PD-L1 antibody that binds with a high affinity to PD-L1 using a phage display technology, and have found that such an anti-PD-L1 antibody can significantly inhibit the formation of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex, thus completing the present disclosure.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200970985,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Successful secretion of proteins has been accomplished both with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. The most prominent examples are bacteria like Escherichia coli, yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris or Hansenula polymorpha, filamentous fungi like Aspergillus awamori or Trichoderma reesei, or mammalian cells like e.g. CHO cells. While the secretion of some proteins is readily achieved at high rates, many other proteins are only secreted at comparatively low levels (Punt et al., 2002; Macauley-Patrick et al., 2005; Porro et al., 2005).
      The heterologous expression of a gene in a host organism requires a vector allowing stable transformation of the host organism. This vector has to provide the gene with a functional promoter adjacent to the 5′ end of the coding sequence. The transcription is thereby regulated and initiated by this promoter sequence. Most promoters used up to date have been derived from genes that code for metabolic enzymes that are usually present at high concentrations in the cell.
      EP 0103409 discloses the use of yeast promoters associated with expression of specific enzymes in the glycolytic pathway, i.e. promoters involved in expression of pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, phosphoglycerate mutase, hexokinase 1 and 2, glucokinase, phosphofructose kinase, aldolase and glycolytic regulation gene.
      WO 97/44470 describes yeast promoters from Yarrowia lipolytica for the translation elongation factor 1 (TEF1) protein and for the ribosomal protein S7 that are suitable for heterologous expression of proteins in yeast.
      WO 2005/003310 provides methods for the expression of a coding sequence of interest in yeast using a promoter of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or phosphoglycerate mutase from oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica.
      One approach for the improvement of the secretion of a recombinant protein was done by random mutagenesis (Archer et al., 1994; Lang and Looman, 1995). The major disadvantage of this method is that positive results usually cannot be transferred to other strains.
      The secretory pathway—the folding and processing of proteins—of eukaryotic organisms, e.g. of yeast, is very complex with many interacting participants. Some of these proteins have catalytic activity on the proteins like protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), others act by binding to the proteins and preventing them from aggregation (chaperones, e.g. BiP), or by stimulating release of the protein to the cell exterior at a later step in the secretory pathway (SSO proteins). Due to this interdependence, increasing the rate of one reaction step in the secretory pathway may not automatically augment secretion of a protein of interest, but instead may cause a rate-limitation at one or more of the subsequent reaction steps and thus may not remove but only shift bottle-neck(s) of the expression system.
      The secretory pathway typically starts by translocation of transmembrane polypeptides and polypeptides intended for secretion into the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). For that purpose, these proteins possess an amino-terminal signal sequence. This signal sequence—also called leader sequence—typically consists of 13 to 36 rather hydrophobic amino acids; no special consensus sequence has been identified yet. On the ER luminal side the signal sequence is removed by a signal peptidase, while the nascent polypeptide is bound to chaperones to prevent miscoiling until translation has finished. ER resident proteins are responsible for correct folding mechanisms. They include, for example, calnexin, calreticulin, Erp72, GRP94, and PDI which latter catalyses the formation of disulfide bonds, and the prolyl-isomerase. Besides, some of the post-translational modifications such as N-glycosylation are initiated in the ER lumen. Proteins are exported to the Golgi apparatus by vesicular transport only after the correct conformation of the proteins has been assured by the ER quality control mechanism. Unless there is a differing signal, proteins intended for secretion are directed from the Golgi apparatus to the outside of the plasma membrane by specific transport vesicles (Stryer and Lubert, 1995; Gething and Sambrook, 1992).
      In most cases the rate limiting step in the eukaryotic secretion pathway has been identified to be the move of proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Shuster, 1991). A mechanism called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is responsible for the retention of misfolded or unmodified non-functional proteins in the ER and their subsequent removal.
      It has been shown in several cases that the secretion process of heterologous proteins can be enhanced by co-overexpression of certain proteins that are involved in the secretory pathway and which support the folding and/or processing of other proteins (Mattanovich et al., 2004).
      Co-expression of the gene encoding PDI and a gene encoding a heterologous disulphide-bonded protein was first suggested in WO 93/25676 as a means of increasing the production of the heterologous protein. WO 93/25676 reports that the recombinant expression of antistasin and tick anticoagulant protein can be increased by co-expression with PDI.
      WO 94/08012 provides methods for increasing protein secretion in yeast by increasing expression of a Hsp70 chaperone protein, i.e. KAR2 and BiP or a PDI chaperone protein.
      The yeast syntaxin homologs SSO1 and SSO2 are necessary for the fusion of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane by acting as t-SNAREs.
      WO 94/08024 discloses a process for producing increased amounts of secreted foreign or endogenous proteins by co-expression of the genes SSO1 and SOS2.
      WO 03/057897 provides methods for the recombinant expression of a protein of interest by co-expressing at least two genes encoding proteins selected from the group consisting of the chaperone proteins GroEL, GRoES, Dnak, DnaJ, GRpe, CIpB and homologs thereof.
      WO 2005/0617818 and WO 2006/067511 provide methods for producing a desired heterologous protein in yeast by using a 2 μm-based expression plasmid. It was demonstrated that the production of a heterologous protein is substantially increased when the genes for one or more chaperone protein(s) and a heterologous protein are co-expressed on the same plasmid.
      Another approach to stimulate the secretory pathway is to overexpress the unfolded protein response (UPR) activating transcription factor HAC1. Transcriptional analyses revealed that up to 330 genes are regulated by HAC1, most of them belonging to the functional groups of secretion or the biogenesis of secretory organelles (e.g. ER-resident chaperones, foldases, components of the Translocon).
      WO 01/72783 describes methods for increasing the amount of a heterologous protein secreted from a eukaryotic cell by inducing an elevated unfolded protein response (UPR), wherein the UPR is modulated by co-expression of a protein selected from the group consisting of HAC1, PTC2 and IRE1.
      The flavoenzyme ERO1 is required for oxidation of protein dithiols in the ER. It is oxidized by molecular oxygen and acts as a specific oxidant of PDI. Disulfides generated de novo within ERO1 are transferred to PDI and then to substrate proteins by dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions.
      WO 99/07727 discloses the use of ERO1 to enhance disulfide bond formation and thereby to increase the yield of properly folded recombinant proteins.
      While these approaches, once established, can be transferred to other strains and used for other proteins as well, they are limited by the actual knowledge about the function of such proteins supporting the secretion of other proteins.
      It can be anticipated that the successful high level secretion of a recombinant protein may be limited at a number of different steps, like folding, disulfide bridge formation, glycosylation, transport within the cell, or release from the cell. As many of these processes are still not fully understood, it can also be anticipated that there are many more proteins involved which support the secretion of a protein, than is currently known. However, such helper functions cannot be predicted with the current knowledge of the state-of-the-art, even when the DNA sequence of the entire genome of a host organism is available.
      Proteins known to be involved in the yeast secretory pathway frequently influence the process of protein folding and subsequent secretion at different steps of the secretion process.
      Accordingly, it is desirable to provide new methods to increase production of secreted proteins in eukaryotic cells which are simple and efficient. It is also desirable to provide new genes to be used in methods for the increased production of secreted proteins. It is also desirable to provide new yeast promoters, especially for use in the expression of heterologous or homologous genes in yeast, in particular in a yeast of the genus Komagataella, but also for expression of a desired gene in any other eukaryotic expression system.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002598849,"BACKGROUND
      Kinases are a superfamily of enzymes that transfer a phosphate group from ATP to target proteins. There are more than 518 kinases encoded in the human genome, including 90 tyrosine kinases, 388 serine/threnine kinases and 40 atypical kinases (Manning, G., D. B. Whyte, et al. (2002), “The protein kinase complement of the human genome” Science 298(5600): 1912-1934). They play vital roles in cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, migration, vascular permeability, etc. Dysfunction of kinases has been implicated in various diseases such as cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neuronal disorders. Several kinase inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of cancers, including but not limited to imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, evrolimus, trastuzumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab (Knight, Z. A., H. Lin, et al. (2010). “Targeting the cancer kinome through polypharmacology” Nat. Rev. Cancer 10(2): 130-137).
      Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase in the insulin receptor family. Other members of the family include lymphocyte tyrosine kinase, insulin receptor kinase, IGF-1 receptor kinase, RTK neutrophin receptor kinases and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (Met) kinase. ALK, which was initially discovered by cloning of the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK fusion gene in anaplastic large cell lymphomas, is encoded by a genomic locus at the chromosomal band 2p23 in the human (Morris, S. W., M. N. Kirstein, et al. (1994). “Fusion of a kinase gene, ALK, to a nucleolar protein gene, NPM, in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma” Science 263(5151): 1281-1284; Shiota, M., J. Fujimoto, et al. (1994). “Hyperphosphorylation of a novel 80 kDa protein-tyrosine kinase similar to Ltk in a human Ki-1 lymphoma cell line, AMS3” Oncogene 9(6): 1567-1574). The genes encoding native, full length receptor forms of ALK in human and mouse were cloned in 1997 (Iwahara, T., J. Fujimoto, et al. (1997). “Molecular characterization of ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed specifically in the nervous system” Oncogene 14(4): 439-449; Morris, S. W., C. Naeve, et al. (1997). “ALK, the chromosome 2 gene locus altered by the t(2; 5) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, encodes a novel neural receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK)” Oncogene 14(18): 2175-2188). The single chain of native ALK protein consists of 1620 amino acids with posttranslational modifications, forming LDL-A, MAM, glycine-rich, transmembrane, and catalytic domains. There are three tyrosine residues (Tyr1278, Tyr1282 and Tyr1283) forming the autophosphorylation motif YxxxYY in the activation loop, a common structural feature found with insulin and IGF1 receptor kinases. The sequential phosphorylation of this tyrosine triplet regulates kinase activity. Recently, X-ray crystal structures of the ALK catalytic domain were determined in apo, ADP-, or inhibitor-bound forms (Bossi, R. T., M. B. Saccardo, et al. (2010). “Crystal structures of anaplastic lymphoma kinase in complex with ATP competitive inhibitors.” Biochemistry 49(32): 6813-6825; Lee, C. C., Y. Jia, et al. (2010). “Crystal structure of the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) catalytic domain” Biochem J 430(3): 425-437; Mctigue, M., Y. Deng, et al. (2010). “Structure of the human anaplastic lymphoma kinase in complex with crizotinib (PF-02341066)” Protein database (2XP2)). ALK shares the basic tyrosine kinase domain architecture and topology. A small N-terminal lobe is connected to a larger C-terminal lobe by a loop referred to as the hinge region, in which E1197 and M1199 forms important hydrogen bonds with ATP/ADP and inhibitors. The activation loop, which consists of residues 1270-1299, begins with the DFG-motif and ends with residues PPE. The catalytic loop, which consist of residues 1247-1254, positions between alphaE and the first strand of the 2-stranded beta-sheet. The structures reveal important interactions between active site residues and inhibitors, and how the functional mutants affect the kinase activity.
      The native ALK is dominantly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems during development (Iwahara, T., J. Fujimoto, et al. (1997). “Molecular characterization of ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed specifically in the nervous system” Oncogene 14(4): 439-449; Morris, S. W., C. Naeve, et al. (1997). “ALK, the chromosome 2 gene locus altered by the t(2; 5) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, encodes a novel neural receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (LTK)” Oncogene 14(18): 2175-2188). As reported by Iwahara et al., the ALK mRNA was detected in thalamus, hypothalamus, mid brain, dorsal root ganglia and olfactory bulb in mouse from day 11. However, the expression level decreased near the gestation, and become barely detectable in adult mouse. ALK expression was only observed in rare scattered neural cells, endothelial cell and pericytes in nervous system in adult and human tissues (Iwahara, T., J. Fujimoto, et al. (1997). “Molecular characterization of ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed specifically in the nervous system” Oncogene 14(4): 439-449; Pulford, K., L. Lamant, et al. (1997). “Detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK proteins in normal and neoplastic cells with the monoclonal antibody ALK1” Blood 89(4): 1394-1404). The restricted tissue expression pattern suggests that ALK plays an important role in the development and function of nervous system. Consistently, ALK receptor was demonstrated as the receptor for growth factors pleiotrophin and midkine for neurite outgrowth (Stoica, G. E., A. Kuo, et al. (2001). “Identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase as a receptor for the growth factor pleiotrophin” J. Biol. Chem. 276(20): 16772-16779; Stoica, G. E., A. Kuo, et al. (2002). “Midkine binds to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and acts as a growth factor for different cell types” J. Biol. Chem. 277(39): 35990-35998; Yanagisawa, H., Y. Komuta, et al. (2010). “Pleiotrophin induces neurite outgrowth and up-regulates growth-associated protein (GAP)-43 mRNA through the ALK/GSK3beta/beta-catenin signaling in developing mouse neurons” Neurosci. Res. 66(1): 111-116). Furthermore, the ALK knockout mice displayed an increased struggling time in the tail suspension test and the Porsolt swim test and enhanced performance in a novel object-recognition test (Bilsland, J. G., A. Wheeldon, et al. (2008). “Behavioral and neurochemical alterations in mice deficient in anaplastic lymphoma kinase suggest therapeutic potential for psychiatric indications” Neuropsychopharmacology 33(3): 685-700). An age-dependent increase in basal hippocampal progenitor proliferation was observed, similar to what is observed after chronic treatment with antidepressants. Other than that, the animals developed normally with no anatomical abnormalities and a full life span. Collectively, these results suggest that ALK could be a new therapeutic target for psychiatric indications, such as schizophrenia and depression.
      Overexpression, mutation and fusion proteins of ALK have been implicated in several cancers, including but not limited to neuroblastoma, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). When its kinase activity is constitutively enhanced by point mutation, amplification or rearrangement of the corresponding genes, ALK become an oncogenic driver, activating numerous signaling pathways to promote tumorigenesis (Palmer, R. H., E. Vernersson, et al. (2009). “Anaplastic lymphoma kinase: signalling in development and disease” Biochem. J. 420(3): 345-361). The signal pathways include those involving Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and target of rapamycin (TOR), sonic hedgehog (Shh), phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), JUN kinase, Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT).
      Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, accounting for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer. Overexpression and point mutations of full-length ALK plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (Chen, Y., J. Takita, et al. (2008). “Oncogenic mutations of ALK kinase in neuroblastoma” Nature 455(7215): 971-974; George, R. E., T. Sanda, et al. (2008). “Activating mutations in ALK provide a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma” Nature 455(7215): 975-978; Janoueix-Lerosey, Lequin et al. 2008. “Somatic and germline activating mutations of the ALK kinase receptor in neuroblastoma” Nature 455(7215): 967-970; Mosse, Y. P., M. Laudenslager, et al. (2008). “Identification of ALK as a major familial neuroblastoma predisposition gene” Nature 455(7215): 930-935; Passoni, L., L. Longo, et al. (2009). “Mutation-independent anaplastic lymphoma kinase overexpression in poor prognosis neuroblastoma patients.” Cancer Res. 69(18): 7338-7346). There are copy number increases of ALK in more than 25% and mis-sense mutations in 6-8% of the primary neuroblastomas. The mutants identified include but not limited to F1174L, R1257Q, G1128A, M1166R, I1171N, F1174I, R1192P, F1245C, F1245V, I1250T, I1250V, T10871, K1062M and Y1278S. Among of them, F1174L is the most frequent somatic mutant, identified in approximately 4% of primary tumors. R1257Q is the mutant identified in both familial and sporadic tumors. Most of the mutations map to critical regions of the kinase domain and are oncogenic drivers. Mutated ALK proteins are over-expressed, hyper-phosphorylated and show constitutive kinase activity in primary neuroblastomas. The knockdown of ALK expression or inhibition of ALK activity by small molecule inhibitors in ALK-mutated cells, and in cell lines over-expressing a wild-type ALK, led to a marked decrease of cell proliferation. Altogether, the available data identify ALK as a critical player in neuroblastoma development, and may represent a very attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease that is still frequently fatal with current treatments.
      ALCL is a rare form of indolent Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that affects T-cells. It is more common in children and men. ALCL often affects the lymph nodes, skin, liver, lungs, and bone marrow. This disease can be either systematic or cutaneous. Approximately 60-80% ACLC is ALK positive (Morris, S. W., M. N. Kirstein, et al. (1994). “Fusion of a kinase gene, ALK, to a nucleolar protein gene, NPM, in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma” Science 263(5151): 1281-1284). The most frequent ALK fusion protein is NPM-ALK, being found in 75-80% of all ALK-positive ALCL patients. Other ALK fusion proteins include but not limited to TPM3-, ATIC-, CLTC-, TFGL-, TFG-, TMP4-ALK. The CLTC-, NPM- or TMP3-ALK (Webb, T. R., J. Slavish, et al. (2009). “Anaplastic lymphoma kinase: role in cancer pathogenesis and small-molecule inhibitor development for therapy” Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 9(3): 331-356). ALK-fusion proteins are also found in rare cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and systemic histiocytosis. ALK fusion proteins mediate oncogenesis by activating the classical receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, and most relevantly, the STAT3 phosphorylation and activation. Transgenic mouse expressing NPM-ALK develop large cell lymphoma with a T-cell phenotype and frequent expression of CD30 antigen. ALK has been shown to be a valid therapeutic target for ALCL.
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the world today. Approximately 85% of the lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ALK gene rearrangement was identified in a small subset (6-7%) of NSCLC patients, involving a small inversion within chromosome 2p to form a fusion gene comprising portions of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the ALK gene (Rikova, K., A. Guo, et al. (2007). “Global survey of phosphotyrosine signaling identifies oncogenic kinases in lung cancer” Cell 131(6): 1190-1203; Soda, M., Y. L. Choi, et al. (2007). “Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small-cell lung cancer” Nature 448(7153): 561-566). In lung cancer, ALK fusion proteins appear to be restricted to patients with adenocarcinoma, mostly in patients with minimal or no smoking history. ALK abnormalities seem to be mutually exclusive to EGFR and KRAS mutations. Other fusion proteins in NSCLC include but not limited to TGF-ALK, KIF5B-ALK. Auto-phosphorylation of EML4-ALK activates PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK pathways, leading to cell growth, proliferation, survival, and cell cycle progression. The oncogenic potential of EML4-ALK was confirmed in transgenic mice that developed hundreds of adenocarcinoma nodules in both lung, and the tumor burden was effectively reduced by administration of an potent ALK inhibitor (Soda, M., S. Takada, et al. (2008). “A mouse model for EML4-ALK-positive lung cancer” Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105(50): 19893-19897). Furthermore, the inhibition of ALK in lung cancer by oral administration of crizotinib, an ALK/cMet inhibitor, resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients. Altogether, ALK is an attractive therapeutic target for NSCLC (Kwak, Bang et al. 2010. “Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer” N. Engl. J. Med. 363(18): 1693-1703).
      IMT are uncommon lesions composed of spindled myofibroblasts within a variable background of collagen and inflammatory cells. The frequency of ALK expression in IMT ranges from 36-62%. Several ALK fusion proteins were identified in IMT patients, such as TPM3-, TPM4-, CLTC-, ATIC-, CARS-, RANBP2- and SEC31L1-ALK (Webb, T. R., J. Slavish, et al. (2009). “Anaplastic lymphoma kinase: role in cancer pathogenesis and small-molecule inhibitor development for therapy” Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 9(3): 331-356). Other tumors with ALK gene rearrangement include, but not limited to, B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and systemic histiocytosis (Webb, T. R., J. Slavish, et al. (2009). “Anaplastic lymphoma kinase: role in cancer pathogenesis and small-molecule inhibitor development for therapy” Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 9(3): 331-356). With more specific and sensitive assays for ALK detection, it is expected that ALK may play a role in more tumors than those identified so far.
      Several small molecule inhibitors of ALK have been reported elsewhere, for example, crizotinib (PF-02341066) is currently under clinical development for lung cancer, ALCL and IMT (Ardini, E., P. Magnaghi, et al. (2010). “Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase: role in specific tumours, and development of small molecule inhibitors for cancer therapy” Cancer Lett. 299(2): 81-94; Milkiewicz, K. L. and G. R. Ott (2010). “Inhibitors of anaplastic lymphoma kinase: a patent review.” Expert Opin. Ther. Pat. 20(12): 1653-1681). Crizotinib inhibits ALK and cMet activities and proliferation of several ALK positive cancer cell lines. Crizotinib is effective in xenograft cancer models. It is noteworthy that Crizotinib was reported to be a time-dependent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor, causing clinical drug-drug interactions. In the reported phase I study, crizotinib was effective against advanced non-small cell lung cancers carrying activated ALK. The overall response rate was 57% and the rate of stable disease was 33%. The response rate is impressive, as compared with the approximately 10% response rate in such cancers that were treated with second-line chemotherapy. However, two secondary drug-resistance mutations in the catalytic domain, L1196M and C1156Y, were observed in a patient who has an initial strong clinical response to crizotinib (Choi, Y. L., M. Soda, et al. (2010). “EML4-ALK mutations in lung cancer that confer resistance to ALK inhibitors” N. Engl. J. Med. 363(18): 1734-1739). Each mutation developed independently in sub-clones of the tumor and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors. The appearance of crizotinib-resistance mutations indicates that additional ALK inhibitors will be required to target EML4-ALK mutants that are insensitive to crizotinib in a clinical settings (Hallberg, B. and R. H. Palmer (2010). “Crizotinib—latest champion in the cancer wars?” N. Engl. J. Med. 363(18): 1760-1762).
      cMet is a high-affinity hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF). cMet/HGF/SF signaling is essential for normal cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tissue regeneration (Danilkovitch-Miagkova, A. and B. Zbar (2002). “Dysregulation of Met receptor tyrosine kinase activity in invasive tumors” J. Clin. Invest. 109(7): 863-867; Christensen, J. G., J. Burrows, et al. (2005). “c-Met as a target for human cancer and characterization of inhibitors for therapeutic intervention” Cancer Lett. 225(1): 1-26). Aberrant cMet/HGF/SF signaling, resulting from mutation or over-expression of the c-Met proto-oncogene and HGF, plays a major role in tumorigenesis, invasion, and metastasis many human tumors. cMet is highly expressed in numerous cancers, and the expression correlates with poor patient prognosis. cMet activating point mutations in the kinase domain are implicated as the cause of hereditary papillary renal carcinoma and were also detected in sporadic papillary renal carcinoma, lung cancers, head and neck cancers, childhood hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Furthermore, amplification of the cMet gene locus was detected in patients with gastric, metastatic colorectal cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. cMet is an attractive therapeutic target for cancer treatment (Christensen, J. G., J. Burrows, et al. (2005). “c-Met as a target for human cancer and characterization of inhibitors for therapeutic intervention” Cancer Lett. 225(1): 1-26).
      Accordingly, the identification of small-molecules that specifically modulate kinase activity, particularly ALK and/or cMet kinase, serves therapeutic approaches for treatment of cancers, inflammation, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, psychological and neurological disorders.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002681849,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are transcription factors which transduce signals from various extracellular cytokines and growth factors to a nucleus. Seven (7) subtypes of STAT proteins (i.e., STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b and STAT6) are currently known, and generally they consist of about 750-850 amino acids. In addition, each subtype of STAT proteins contains several conserved domains which play an important role in exhibiting the function of STAT proteins. Specifically, five (5) domains from N-terminus to C-terminus of STAT proteins have been reported including coiled-coiled domain, DNA binding domain, linker domain, SH2 domain and transactivation domain (TAD)). Further, X-ray crystalline structures of STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 have been reported since 1998 (Becker S et al., Nature, 1998, 394; Vinkemeier U et al., Science, 1998, 279; Chen X et al., Cell, 1998, 93; D. Neculai et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2005, 280). In general, receptors to which cytokines and growth factors bind are categorized into Class I and Class II. IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, thrombopoietin, etc., bind to Class I receptors, while INF-α, INF-γ, IL-10, etc., bind to Class II receptors (Schindler C et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem., 1995, 64; Novick D et al., Cell, 1994, 77; Ho AS et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 1993, 90). Among them, the cytokine receptors involved in the activation of STAT proteins can be classified depending on their structural forms of extracellular domains into a gp-130 family, an IL-2 family, a growth factor family, an interferon family and a receptor tyrosine kinase family. Interleukin-6 family cytokines are representative multifunctional cytokines which mediate various physiological activities. When interleukin-6 cytokine binds to IL-6 receptor, it attracts gp-130 receptor to form an IL-6-gp-130 receptor complex. At the same time, JAK kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2) in the cytoplasm are recruited to a cytoplasmic region of gp130 to be phosphorylated and activated. Subsequently, latent cytoplasmic STAT proteins are attracted to a receptor, phosphorylated by JAK kinases and activated. Tyrosine-705 near the SH2 domain located in the C-terminus of STAT proteins is phosphorylated, and the activated tyrosine-705 of each STAT protein monomer binds to the SH2 domain of another monomer in a reciprocal manner, thereby forming a homo- or heterodimer. The dimers are translocalized into a nucleus and bind to a specific DNA binding promoter to promote the transcription. Through its transcription process, various proteins (Myc, Cyclin D1/D2, Bcl-xL, Mcl, survivin, VEGF, HIF-1, immune suppressors, etc.) associated with cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and immune evasion are produced (Stark et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem., 1997, 67; Levy et al., Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol., 2002, 3).
      In particular, STAT3 protein is known to play a crucial role in the acute inflammatory response and the signal transduction pathway of IL-6 and EGF (Akira et al., Cell, 1994, 76; Zhong et al., Science, 1994, 264). According to the recent clinical report, STAT3 protein is constantly activated in patients with solid cancers occurring in prostate, stomach, breast, lung, pancreas, kidney, uterine, ovary, head and neck, etc., and also in patients with blood cancer such as acute and chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, etc. Further, it has been reported that the survival rate of a patient group with activated STAT3 is remarkably lower than that of a patient group with inactivated STAT3 (Masuda et al., Cancer Res., 2002, 62; Benekli et al., Blood, 2002, 99; Yuichi et al., Int. J. Oncology, 2007, 30). Meanwhile, STAT3 was identified to be an essential factor for the growth and maintenance of murine embryonic stem cells in a study employing a STAT3 knockout mouse model. Also, a study with a tissue-specific STAT3-deficient mouse model, reveals that STAT3 plays an important role in cell growth, apoptosis, and cell motility in a tissue-specific manner (Akira et al., Oncogene 2000, 19). Moreover, since apoptosis by anti-sensing STAT3 was observed in various cancer cell lines, STAT3 is considered as a promising new anticancer target. STAT3 is also considered as a potential target in the treatment of patients with diabetes, immune-related diseases, hepatitis C, macular degeneration, human papillomavirus infection, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, tuberculosis, etc. In contrast, although STAT1 has identical intracellular response pathways of cytokines and growth factors to those of STAT3, STAT1 increases inflammation and congenital and acquired immunities to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells or cause pro-apoptotic responses, unlike STAT3 (Valeria Poli et al., Review, Landes Bioscience, 2009).
      In order to develop STAT3 inhibitors, the following methods can be considered: i) inhibition of the phosphorylation of STAT3 protein by IL-6/gp-130/JAK kinase, ii) inhibition of the dimerization of activated STAT3 protein, and iii) inhibition of the binding of STAT3 dimer to nuclear DNA. Small molecular STAT3 inhibitors are currently under development. Specifically, OPB-31121 and OPB-51602 are under clinical studies on patients with solid cancers or blood cancers by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Further, S3I-201 (Siddiquee et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2007, 104), S3I-M2001 (Siddiquee et al., Chem. Biol., 2007, 2), LLL-12 (Lin et al., Neoplasia, 2010, 12), Stattic (Schust et al., Chem. Biol. 2006, 13), STA-21 (Song et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2005, 102), SF-1-066 (Zhang et al., Biochem. Pharm., 2010, 79) and STX-0119 (Matsuno et al., ACS Med. Chem. Lett., 2010, 1), etc. have been tested in a cancer cell growth inhibition experiment and in animal model (in vivo Xenograft model). Furthermore, although peptide compounds mimicking the adjacent amino acid sequence of pY-705 (STAT3) which binds to SH2 domain or the amino acid sequence of gp-130 receptor that JAK kinases bind were studied (Coleman et al., J. Med. Chem., 2005, 48), the development of the peptide compounds has not been successful due to the problems such as solubility and membrane permeability.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002691698,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Stem and progenitor cell differentiation and cell proliferation are normal ongoing processes that act in concert to support tissue growth during organogenesis and cell replacement and repair of most tissues during the lifetime of all living organisms. In the normal course of events cellular differentiation and proliferation is controlled by numerous factors and signals that are generally balanced to maintain cell fate decisions and tissue architecture. Thus, to a large extent it is this controlled microenvironment that regulates cell division and tissue maturation where signals are properly generated based on the needs of the organism. In this regard cell proliferation and differentiation normally occur only as necessary for the replacement of damaged or dying cells or for growth. Unfortunately, disruption of cell proliferation and/or differentiation can result from a myriad of factors including, for example, the under- or overabundance of various signaling chemicals, the presence of altered microenvironments, genetic mutations or some combination thereof. When normal cellular proliferation and/or differentiation is disturbed or somehow disrupted it can lead to various diseases or disorders including proliferative disorders such as cancer.
      Conventional treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, immunotherapy (e.g., biological response modifiers, vaccines or targeted therapeutics) or combinations thereof. Unfortunately, certain cancers are non-responsive or minimally responsive to such treatments. For example, in some patients tumors exhibit gene mutations that render them non-responsive despite the general effectiveness of selected therapies. Moreover, depending on the type of cancer and what form it takes some available treatments, such as surgery, may not be viable alternatives. Limitations inherent in current standard of care therapeutics are particularly evident when attempting to treat patients who have undergone previous treatments and have subsequently relapsed. In such cases the failed therapeutic regimens and resulting patient deterioration may contribute to refractory tumors which often manifest themselves as a relatively aggressive disease that ultimately proves to be incurable. Although there have been great improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer over the years, overall survival rates for many solid tumors have remained largely unchanged due to the failure of existing therapies to prevent relapse, tumor recurrence and metastases. Thus, it remains a challenge to develop more targeted and potent therapies for proliferative disorders.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      These and other objectives are provided for by the present invention which, in a broad sense, is directed to methods, compounds, compositions and articles of manufacture that may be used in the treatment of SEZ6 associated disorders (e.g., proliferative disorders or neoplastic disorders). To that end, the present invention provides novel seizure related 6 homolog (or SEZ6) modulators that effectively target tumor cells and/or cancer stem cells and may be used to treat patients suffering from a wide variety of malignancies. As will be discussed in more detail herein, there are at least two naturally occurring SEZ6 isoforms or variants and the disclosed modulators may comprise or associate selectively with one isoform or the other or with both. Moreover, in certain embodiments the disclosed SEZ6 modulators may further react with one or more SEZ family members (e.g., SEZ6L or SEZ6L2) or, in other embodiments, may be generated and selected for so as to exclusively associate or react with SEZ6 isoform(s). In any event the modulators may comprise any compound that recognizes, competes, agonizes, antagonizes, interacts, binds or associates with a SEZ6 polypeptide or gene (or fragment thereof) and modulates, adjusts, alters, changes or modifies the impact of the SEZ6 protein on one or more physiological pathways. Thus, in a broad sense the present invention is generally directed to isolated SEZ6 modulators and use thereof. In preferred embodiments the invention is more particularly directed to isolated SEZ6 modulators comprising antibodies (i.e., antibodies that immunopreferentially bind, react with or associate with at least one isoform of SEZ6) that, in particularly preferred embodiments, are associated or conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents. Moreover, as discussed extensively below, such modulators may be used to provide pharmaceutical compositions useful for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or treatment of proliferative disorders.
      In selected embodiments of the invention, SEZ6 modulators may comprise a SEZ6 polypeptide or fragments thereof, either in an isolated form or fused or associated with other moieties (e.g., Fc-SEZ6, PEG-SEZ6 or SEZ6 associated with a targeting moiety). In other selected embodiments SEZ6 modulators may comprise SEZ6 antagonists which, for the purposes of the instant application, shall be held to mean any construct or compound that recognizes, competes, interacts, binds or associates with SEZ6 and neutralizes, eliminates, reduces, sensitizes, reprograms, inhibits or controls the growth of neoplastic cells including tumor initiating cells. In preferred embodiments the SEZ6 modulators of the instant invention comprise anti-SEZ6 antibodies, or fragments or derivatives thereof, that have unexpectedly been found to silence, neutralize, reduce, decrease, deplete, moderate, diminish, reprogram, eliminate, or otherwise inhibit the ability of tumor initiating cells to propagate, maintain, expand, proliferate or otherwise facilitate the survival, recurrence, regeneration and/or metastasis of neoplastic cells. In particularly preferred embodiments the antibodies or immunoreactive fragments may be associated with or conjugated to one or more anti-cancer agents (e.g., a cytotoxic agent).
      With regard to such modulators it will be appreciated that compatible antibodies may take on any one of a number of forms including, for example, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, chimeric, CDR grafted, humanized and human antibodies and immunoreactive fragments and/or variants of each of the foregoing. Preferred embodiments will comprise antibodies that are relatively non-immunogenic such as humanized or fully human constructs. Of course, in view of the instant disclosure those skilled in the art could readily identify one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) associated with heavy and light chain variable regions of SEZ6 antibody modulators and use those CDRs to engineer or fabricate chimeric, humanized or CDR grafted antibodies without undue experimentation. Accordingly, in certain preferred embodiments the SEZ6 modulator comprises an antibody that incorporates one or more CDRs as defined in FIGS. 10A and 10B and derived from the light ( FIG. 10A) or heavy ( FIG. 10B) contiguous chain murine variable regions (SEQ ID NOS: 20-169) set forth therein. Such CDR grafted variable regions having a human framework and variants thereof are also shown in FIG. 10 comprising SEQ ID NOS: 170-199. In preferred embodiments such antibodies will comprise monoclonal antibodies and, in even more preferred embodiments, will comprise chimeric, CDR grafted or humanized antibodies.
      Exemplary nucleic acid sequences encoding each of the amino acid sequences set forth in FIGS. 10A and 10B are appended hereto in the sequence listing and comprise SEQ ID NOS: 220 to 399. In this respect it will be appreciated that the invention further comprises nucleic acid molecules (and associated constructs, vectors and host cells) encoding disclosed antibody variable region amino acid sequences including those set forth in the attached sequence listing.
      More particularly, in selected embodiments compatible SEZ6 modulators may comprise an antibody having a light chain variable region and a heavy chain variable region wherein said light chain variable region comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 60% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acid sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 28, SEQ ID NO: 30, SEQ ID NO: 32, SEQ ID NO: 34, SEQ ID NO: 36, SEQ ID NO: 38, SEQ ID NO: 40, SEQ ID NO: 42, SEQ ID NO: 44, SEQ ID NO: 46, SEQ ID NO: 48, SEQ ID NO: 50, SEQ ID NO: 52, SEQ ID NO: 54, SEQ ID NO: 56, SEQ ID NO: 58, SEQ ID NO: 60, SEQ ID NO: 62, SEQ ID NO: 64, SEQ ID NO: 66, SEQ ID NO: 68, SEQ ID NO: 70, SEQ ID NO: 72, SEQ ID NO: 74, SEQ ID NO: 76, SEQ ID NO: 78 SEQ ID NO: 80, SEQ ID NO: 82, SEQ ID NO: 84, SEQ ID NO: 86, SEQ ID NO: 88, SEQ ID NO: 90, SEQ ID NO: 92, SEQ ID NO: 94, SEQ ID NO: 96, SEQ ID NO: 98, SEQ ID NO: 100, SEQ ID NO: 102, SEQ ID NO: 104, SEQ ID NO: 106, SEQ ID NO: 108, SEQ ID NO: 110, SEQ ID NO: 112, SEQ ID NO: 114, SEQ ID NO: 116, SEQ ID NO: 118, SEQ ID NO: 120, SEQ ID NO: 122, SEQ ID NO: 124, SEQ ID NO: 126, SEQ ID NO: 128, SEQ ID NO: 130, SEQ ID NO: 132, SEQ ID NO: 134, SEQ ID NO: 136, SEQ ID NO: 138, SEQ ID NO: 140, SEQ ID NO: 142, SEQ ID NO: 144, SEQ ID NO: 146, SEQ ID NO: 148, SEQ ID NO: 150, SEQ ID NO: 152, SEQ ID NO: 154, SEQ ID NO: 156, SEQ ID NO: 158, SEQ ID NO: 160, SEQ ID NO: 162, SEQ ID NO: 164, SEQ ID NO: 166 and SEQ ID NO: 168 and wherein said heavy chain variable region comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 60% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acid sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 25, SEQ ID NO: 27, SEQ ID NO: 29, SEQ ID NO: 31, SEQ ID NO: 33, SEQ ID NO: 35, SEQ ID NO: 37, SEQ ID NO: 39, SEQ ID NO: 41, SEQ ID NO: 43, SEQ ID NO: 45, SEQ ID NO: 47, SEQ ID NO: 49, SEQ ID NO: 51, SEQ ID NO: 53, SEQ ID NO: 55, SEQ ID NO: 57, SEQ ID NO: 59, SEQ ID NO: 61, SEQ ID NO: 63, SEQ ID NO: 65, SEQ ID NO: 67, SEQ ID NO: 69, SEQ ID NO: 71, SEQ ID NO: 73, SEQ ID NO: 75, SEQ ID NO: 77, SEQ ID NO: 79, SEQ ID NO: 81, SEQ ID NO: 83, SEQ ID NO: 85, SEQ ID NO: 87, SEQ ID NO: 89, SEQ ID NO: 91, SEQ ID NO: 93, SEQ ID NO: 95, SEQ ID NO: 97, SEQ ID NO: 99, SEQ ID NO: 101, SEQ ID NO: 103, SEQ ID NO: 105, SEQ ID NO: 107, SEQ ID NO: 109, SEQ ID NO: 111, SEQ ID NO: 113, SEQ ID NO: 115, SEQ ID NO: 117, SEQ ID NO: 119, SEQ ID NO: 121, SEQ ID NO: 123, SEQ ID NO: 125, SEQ ID NO: 127, SEQ ID NO: 129, SEQ ID NO: 131, SEQ ID NO: 133, SEQ ID NO: 135, SEQ ID NO: 137, SEQ ID NO: 139, SEQ ID NO: 141, SEQ ID NO: 143, SEQ ID NO: 145, SEQ ID NO: 147, SEQ ID NO: 149, SEQ ID NO: 151, SEQ ID NO: 153, SEQ ID NO: 155, SEQ ID NO: 157, SEQ ID NO: 159, SEQ ID NO: 161, SEQ ID NO: 163, SEQ ID NO: 165, SEQ ID NO: 167 and SEQ ID NO: 169. In other preferred embodiments the selected modulators will comprise heavy and light chain variable regions that comprise 65, 70, 75 or 80% identity to the aforementioned murine sequences. In still other embodiments the modulators will comprise heavy and light chain variable regions that comprise 85, 90 or even 95% identity to the disclosed murine sequences.
      Of course, in view of the instant disclosure those skilled in the art could readily identify CDRs associated with each of the aforementioned heavy and light chain variable regions and use those CDRs to engineer or fabricate chimeric, humanized or CDR grafted antibodies without undue experimentation. As such, in selected embodiments the present invention is directed to anti-SEZ6 antibodies comprising one or more CDRs from a variable region sequence set forth in FIG. 10A or FIG. 10B. In preferred embodiments such antibodies will comprise monoclonal antibodies and, in even more preferred embodiments will comprise chimeric, CDR grafted or humanized antibodies. As discussed in more detail below still other embodiments will comprise such antibodies conjugated or associated with one or more cytotoxic agents.
      Another aspect of the invention comprises modulators obtained or derived from SC17.1, SC17.2, SC17.3, SC17.4, SC17.8, SC17.9, SC17.10, SC17.11, SC17.14, SC17.15, SC17.16, SC17.17, SC17.18, SC17.19, SC17.22, SC17.24, SC17.27, SC17.28, SC17.29, SC17.30, SC17.32, SC17.34, SC17.35, SC17.36, SC17.38, SC17.39, SC17.40, SC17.41, SC17.42, SC17.45, SC17.46, SC17.47, SC17.49, SC17.50, SC17.53, SC17.54, SC17.56, SC17.57, SC17.59, SC17.61, SC17.63, SC17.71, SC17.72, SC17.74, SC17.76, SC17.77, SC17.79, SC17.81, SC17.82, SC17.84, SC17.85, SC17.87, SC17.89, SC17.90, SC17.91, SC17.93, SC17.95, SC17.97, SC17.99, SC17.102, SC17.114, SC17.115, SC17.120, SC17121, SC17.122, SC17.140, SC17.151, SC17.156, SC17.161, SC17.166, SC17.187, SC17.191, SC17.193, SC17.199 and SC17.200.
      In yet other compatible embodiments the instant invention will comprise the CDR grafted or humanized SEZ6 modulators hSC17.16, hSC17.17, hSC17.24, hSC17.28, SC17.34, hSC17.46, SC17.151, SC17.155, SC17.156, SC17.161 and SC17.200. Still other embodiments are directed to a SEZ6 modulator comprising a humanized antibody wherein said humanized antibody comprises a light chain variable region and a heavy chain variable region wherein said light chain variable region comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 60% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acid sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 170, SEQ ID NO: 172, SEQ ID NO: 174, SEQ ID NO: 176, SEQ ID NO: 178, SEQ ID NO: 180, SEQ ID NO: 182, SEQ ID NO: 184, SEQ ID NO: 186, SEQ ID NO: 188 and SEQ ID NO: 190 and wherein said heavy chain variable region comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 60% identity to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of amino acid sequences as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 171, SEQ ID NO: 173, SEQ ID NO: 175, SEQ ID NO: 177, SEQ ID NO: 179 and SEQ ID NO: 181, SEQ ID NO: 183, SEQ ID NO: 185, SEQ ID NO: 187, SEQ ID NO: 189 and SEQ ID NO: 191. Additionally, certain humanized variants of light (SEQ ID NO: 192) and heavy (SEQ ID NO: 193, SEQ ID NO: 194, SEQ ID NO: 195, SEQ ID NO: 196, SEQ ID NO: 197, SEQ ID NO: 198 and SEQ ID NO: 199) chain variable regions are provided in accordance with the teachings herein. Moreover, as described immediately above nucleic acid sequences encoding the exemplified humanized heavy and light chain variable regions are set forth in the sequence listing appended hereto as SEQ ID NOS: 370-399.
      Besides the aforementioned aspects, other preferred embodiments of the instant invention will comprise SEZ6 modulators associated or conjugated to one or more drugs to provide modulator conjugates that may be particularly effective in treating proliferative disorders (alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically active agents). More generally, once the modulators of the invention have been fabricated and selected they may be linked with, fused to, conjugated to (e.g., covalently or non-covalently) or otherwise associated with pharmaceutically active or diagnostic moieties or biocompatible modifiers. As used herein the term “conjugate” or “modulator conjugate” or “antibody conjugate” will be used broadly and held to mean any biologically active or detectable molecule or drug associated with the disclosed modulators regardless of the method of association. In this respect it will be understood that such conjugates may, in addition to the disclosed modulators, comprise peptides, polypeptides, proteins, prodrugs which are metabolized to an active agent in vivo, polymers, nucleic acid molecules, small molecules, binding agents, mimetic agents, synthetic drugs, inorganic molecules, organic molecules and radioisotopes. Moreover, as indicated above the selected conjugate may be covalently or non-covalently associated with, or linked to, the modulator and exhibit various stoichiometric molar ratios depending, at least in part, on the method used to effect the conjugation.
      Particularly preferred aspects of the instant invention will comprise antibody modulator conjugates or antibody-drug conjugates that may be used for the diagnosis and/or treatment of proliferative disorders. Such conjugates may be represented by the formula M-[L-D]n where M stands for a disclosed modulator or target binding moiety, L is an optional linker or linker unit, D is a compatible drug or prodrug and n is an integer from about 1 to about 20. It will be appreciated that, unless otherwise dictated by context, the terms “antibody-drug conjugate” or “ADC” or the formula M-[L-D]n shall be held to encompass conjugates comprising both therapeutic and diagnostic moieties. In such embodiments antibody-drug conjugate compounds will typically comprise anti-SEZ6 as the modulator unit (M), a therapeutic or diagnostic moiety (D), and optionally a linker (L) that joins the drug and the antigen binding agent. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is a SEZ6 mAb comprising at least one CDR from the heavy and light chain variable regions as described above.
      As previously indicated one aspect of the invention may comprise the unexpected association of SEZ6 polypeptides with cancer stem cells. Thus, in certain other embodiments the invention will comprise a SEZ6 modulator that reduces the frequency of tumor initiating cells upon administration to a subject. Preferably the reduction in frequency will be determined using in vitro or in vivo limiting dilution analysis. In particularly preferred embodiments such analysis may be conducted using in vivo limiting dilution analysis comprising transplant of live human tumor cells into immunocompromised mice. Alternatively, the limiting dilution analysis may be conducted using in vitro limiting dilution analysis comprising limiting dilution deposition of live human tumor cells into in vitro colony supporting conditions. In either case, the analysis, calculation or quantification of the reduction in frequency will preferably comprise the use of Poisson distribution statistics to provide an accurate accounting. It will be appreciated that, while such quantification methods are preferred, other, less labor intensive methodology such as flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry may also be used to provide the desired values and, accordingly, are expressly contemplated as being within the scope of the instant invention. In such cases the reduction in frequency may be determined using flow cytometric analysis or immunohistochemical detection of tumor cell surface markers known to enrich for tumor initiating cells.
      As such, in another preferred embodiment of the instant invention comprises a method of treating a SEZ6 associated disorder comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a SEZ6 modulator to a subject in need thereof whereby the frequency of tumor initiating cells is reduced. Preferably the SEZ6 associated disorder comprises a neoplastic disorder. Again, the reduction in the tumor initiating cell frequency will preferably be determined using in vitro or in vivo limiting dilution analysis.
      In this regard it will be appreciated that the present invention is based, at least in part, upon the discovery that SEZ6 immunogens are associated with tumor perpetuating cells (i.e., cancer stem cells) that are involved in the etiology of various neoplasia. More specifically, the instant application unexpectedly demonstrates that the administration of various exemplary SEZ6 modulators can mediate, reduce, deplete, inhibit or eliminate tumorigenic signaling by tumor initiating cells (i.e., reduce the frequency of tumor initiating cells). This reduced signaling, whether by depletion, neutralization, reduction, elimination, reprogramming or silencing of the tumor initiating cells or by modifying tumor cell morphology (e.g., induced differentiation, niche disruption), in turn allows for the more effective treatment of SEZ6 associated disorders by inhibiting tumorigenesis, tumor maintenance, expansion and/or metastasis and recurrence.
      Besides the aforementioned association with cancer stem cells, there is evidence that SEZ6 isoforms may be implicated in the growth, recurrence or metastatic potential of tumors comprising neuroendocrine features. For the purposes of the instant invention such tumors will comprise neuroendocrine tumors and pseudo neuroendocrine tumors. Intervention in the proliferation of such tumorigenic cells using the novel SEZ6 modulators described herein, may thereby ameliorate or treat a disorder by more than one mechanism (i.e., tumor initiating cell reduction and disruption of oncogenic pathway signaling) to provide additive or synergistic effects. Still other preferred embodiments may take advantage of the cellular internalization of cell surface SEZ6 to deliver a modulator mediated anti-cancer agent. In this regard it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited by any particular mechanism of action but rather encompasses the broad use of the disclosed modulators to treat SEZ6 associated disorders (including various neoplasia).
      Thus, in other embodiments the present invention will comprise the use of the disclosed modulators to treat tumors comprising neuroendocrine features in a subject in need thereof. Of course the same modulators may be used for the prophylaxis, prognosis, diagnosis, theragnosis, inhibition or maintenance therapy of these same tumors.
      Other facets of the instant invention exploit the ability of the disclosed modulators to potentially disrupt oncogenic pathways while simultaneously silencing tumor initiating cells. Such multi-active SEZ6 modulators (e.g., SEZ6 antagonists) may prove to be particularly effective when used in combination with standard of care anti-cancer agents or debulking agents. Accordingly preferred embodiments of the instant invention comprise using the disclosed modulators as anti-metastatic agents for maintenance therapy following initial treatments. In addition, two or more SEZ6 antagonists (e.g. antibodies that specifically bind to two discrete epitopes on SEZ6) may be used in combination in accordance with the present teachings. Moreover, as discussed in some detail below, the SEZ6 modulators of the present invention may be used in a conjugated or unconjugated state and, optionally, as a sensitizing agent in combination with a variety of chemical or biological anti-cancer agents.
      Accordingly another preferred embodiment of the instant invention comprises a method of sensitizing a tumor in a subject for treatment with an anti-cancer agent comprising the step of administering a SEZ6 modulator to said subject. Other embodiments comprise a method of reducing metastasis or tumor recurrence following treatment comprising administering a SEZ6 modulator to a subject in need thereof. In a particularly preferred aspect of the invention the SEZ6 modulator will specifically result in a reduction of tumor initiating cell frequency as determined using in vitro or in vivo limiting dilution analysis.
      More generally preferred embodiments of the invention comprise a method of treating a SEZ6 associated disorder in a subject in need thereof comprising the step of administering a SEZ6 modulator to the subject. In particularly preferred embodiments the SEZ6 modulator will be associated (e.g., conjugated) with an anti-cancer agent. In yet other embodiments the SEZ6 modulator will internalize following association or binding with SEZ6 on or near the surface of the cell. Moreover the beneficial aspects of the instant invention, including any disruption of signaling pathways and collateral benefits, may be achieved whether the subject tumor tissue exhibits elevated levels of SEZ6 or reduced or depressed levels of SEZ6 as compared with normal adjacent tissue. Particularly preferred embodiments will comprise the treatment of disorders exhibiting elevated levels of SEZ6 on tumorigenic cells as compared to normal tissue or non-tumorigenic cells.
      In yet another aspect the present invention will comprise a method of treating a subject suffering from a neoplastic disorder comprising the step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one internalizing SEZ6 modulator. Preferred embodiments will comprise the administration of internalizing antibody modulators wherein, in other selected embodiments, the internalizing antibody modulators are conjugated or associated with a cytotoxic agent.
      Other embodiments are directed to a method of treating a subject suffering from a SEZ6 associated disorder comprising the step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one depleting SEZ6 modulator.
      In yet another embodiment the present invention provides methods of maintenance therapy wherein the disclosed effectors or modulators are administered over a period of time following an initial procedure (e.g., chemotherapeutic, radiation or surgery) designed to remove at least a portion of the tumor mass. Such therapeutic regimens may be administered over a period of weeks, a period of months or even a period of years wherein the SEZ6 modulators may act prophylactically to inhibit metastasis and/or tumor recurrence. In yet other embodiments the disclosed modulators may be administrated in concert with known debulking regimens to prevent or retard metastasis, tumor maintenance or recurrence.
      It will further be appreciated that the SEZ6 modulators of the instant invention may be generated and selected to react with known isoform(s) of SEZ6 or a single isoform of the protein or, conversely, may comprise a pan-SEZ6 modulator that reacts or associates with at least one additional SEZ6 family member (e.g., SEZ6L or SEZ6L2 and isoforms thereof) in addition to SEZ6. More specifically, as disclosed herein preferred modulators such as antibodies may be generated and selected so that they react with domains (or epitopes therein) that are exhibited by SEZ6 only or with domains that are at least somewhat conserved across two or more of the SEZ6 family members.
      In yet other preferred embodiments the modulators will associate or bind to a specific epitope, portion, motif or domain of SEZ6. As will be discussed in some detail below both SEZ6 isoforms incorporate an identical extracellular region (see FIG. 1E) comprising at least an N-terminal domain, two alternating Sushi and CUB domains, and three additional tandem Sushi domain repeats. In addition the SEZ6 protein comprises a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. Accordingly, in certain embodiments the modulators will bind or associate with the N-terminal domain of SEZ6 (i.e. amino acids 1-335 in the mature protein) or to an epitope therein. Other aspects of the instant invention comprise modulators that associate or bind to a specific epitope located in a particular Sushi domain of SEZ6. In this regard the particular modulator may associate or bind to an epitope located in Sushi Domain 1 (amino acids 336-395), Sushi Domain 2 (amino acids 511-572), Sushi Domain 3 (amino acids 690-748), Sushi Domain 4 (amino acids 750-813) or Sushi Domain 5 (amino acids 817-878). Other aspects of the instant invention comprise modulators that associate or bind to a specific epitope located in a particular CUB-like domain of SEZ6. In this regard the particular modulator may associate or bind to an epitope located in CUB Domain 1 (amino acids 397-508) or CUB Domain 2 (amino acids 574-685). Of course it will be appreciated that each of the aforementioned domains may comprise more than one epitope and may be associated with more than one bin.
      With regard to modulator or antibody “bins” it will be appreciated that the SEZ6 antigen may be analyzed or mapped through competitive antibody binding using art recognized techniques to define specific bins located along the protein. While discussed in more detail herein and shown in Examples 9 and 10 below, two antibodies (one of which may be termed a “reference antibody,” “bin delineating antibody” or “delineating antibody”) may be considered to be in the same bin if they substantially compete with each other for binding to the target antigen. In such cases the subject antibody epitopes may be identical, substantially identical or close enough (either in a linear sense where they are separated by a few amino acids or conformationally) so that both antibodies are sterically or electrostatically inhibited or precluded from binding to the antigen. Such defined bins may be generally associated with certain SEZ6 domains (e.g. the reference antibody will bind with an epitope contained in a specific domain) though the correlation is not always precise (e.g., there may be more than one bin in a domain or the bin may be defined conformationally and comprise more than one domain). It will be appreciated that those skilled in the art can readily determine the relationship between the SEZ6 domains and empirically determined bins.
      With regard to the present invention competitive binding analysis using art-recognized techniques (e.g., ELISA, surface plasmon resonance or bio-layer interferometry) defined at least seven distinct bins, each of which was found to contain a number of antibody modulators. For the purposes of the instant disclosure the seven bins were termed bins A-F and bin U. Bins A-F are unique bins and the antibodies contained in each of these bins compete with each other for binding to the SEZ6 protein. Bin U contains antibodies that do not compete with antibodies in Bins A-F, but may compete for binding with each other. Thus, in selected embodiments the present invention will comprise a modulator residing in a bin selected from the group consisting of bin A, bin B, bin C, bin D, bin E, bin F, and bin U. In other embodiments the present invention comprises a modulator residing in a bin defined by a reference antibody selected from the group consisting of SC17.1, SC17.2, SC17.3, SC17.4, SC17.8, SC17.9, SC17.10, SC17.11, SC17.14, SC17.15, SC17.16, SC17.17, SC17.18, SC17.19, SC17.22, SC17.24, SC17.27, SC17.28, SC17.29, SC17.30, SC17.32, SC17.34, SC17.35, SC17.36, SC17.38, SC17.39, SC17.40, SC17.41, SC17.42, SC17.45, SC17.46, SC17.47, SC17.49, SC17.50, SC17.53, SC17.54, SC17.56, SC17.57, SC17.59, SC17.61, SC17.63, SC17.71, SC17.72, SC17.74, SC17.76, SC17.77, SC17.79, SC17.81, SC17.82, SC17.84, SC17.85, SC17.87, SC17.89, SC17.90, SC17.91, SC17.93, SC17.95, SC17.97, SC17.99, SC17.102, SC17.114, SC17.115, SC17.120, SC17121, SC17.122, SC17.140, SC17.151, SC17.156, SC17.161, SC17.166, SC17.187, SC17.191, SC17.193, SC17.199 and SC17.200. In still other embodiments the invention will comprise modulators from bin A, modulators from bin B, modulators from bin C, modulators from bin D, modulators from bin E, modulators from bin F or modulators from bin U. Yet other preferred embodiments will comprise a reference antibody modulator and any antibody that competes with the reference antibody.
      The term “compete” or “competing antibody” when used in the context of the disclosed modulators means binding competition between antibodies as determined by an assay in which a reference antibody or immunologically functional fragment substantially prevents or inhibits (e.g., greater than 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% or 90%.) specific binding of a test antibody to a common antigen. Compatible methods for determining such competition comprise art known techniques such as, for example, bio-layer interferometry, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry, competitive ELISA, etc.
      In a selected embodiment the invention comprises a pan-SEZ6 modulator that associates with SEZ6 and at least one other SEZ6 family member (e.g., SEZ6L or SEZ6L2). In other selected embodiments the invention comprises a SEZ6 modulator that immunospecifically associates with one or more isoform of SEZ6 but does not immunospecifically associate with any other SEZ6 family member. In yet other embodiments the present invention comprises a method of treating a subject in need thereof comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pan-SEZ6 modulator. Still other embodiments comprise a method of treating a subject in need thereof comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a SEZ6 modulator that immunospecifically associates with one or more isoforms of SEZ6 but does not immunospecifically associate with any other SEZ6 family member.
      Beyond the therapeutic uses discussed above it will also be appreciated that the modulators of the instant invention may be used to detect, diagnose or classify SEZ6 relatedg disorders and, in particular, proliferative disorders. In some embodiments the modulator may be administered to the subject and detected or monitored in vivo. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that such modulators may be labeled or associated with markers or reporters as disclosed below and detected using any one of a number of standard techniques (e.g., MRI, CAT scan PET scan, etc.).
      Thus, in some embodiments the invention will comprise a method of diagnosing, detecting or monitoring a SEZ6 associated disorder in vivo in a subject in need thereof comprising the step of administering a SEZ6 modulator.
      In other instances the modulators may be used in an in vitro diagnostic setting using art-recognized procedures. As such, a preferred embodiment comprises a method of diagnosing a proliferative disorder in a subject in need thereof comprising the steps of:
a. obtaining a tissue sample from said subject;
b. contacting the tissue sample with at least one SEZ6 modulator; and
c. detecting or quantifying the SEZ6 modulator associated with the sample.
a. obtaining a tissue sample from said subject;
b. contacting the tissue sample with at least one SEZ6 modulator; and
c. detecting or quantifying the SEZ6 modulator associated with the sample.
      Such methods may be easily discerned in conjunction with the instant application and may be readily performed using generally available commercial technology such as automatic plate readers, dedicated reporter systems, etc. In selected embodiments the SEZ6 modulator will be associated with tumor perpetuating cells present in the sample. In other preferred embodiments the detecting or quantifying step will comprise a reduction of tumor initiating cell frequency and detection thereof. Moreover, limiting dilution analysis may be conducted as previously alluded to above and will preferably employ the use of Poisson distribution statistics to provide an accurate accounting as to the reduction of frequency.
      In a similar vein the present invention also provides kits or devices and associated methods that are useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of SEZ6 associated disorders such as cancer. To this end the present invention preferably provides an article of manufacture useful for diagnosing or treating SEZ6 associated disorders comprising a receptacle comprising a SEZ6 modulator and instructional materials for using said SEZ6 modulator to treat or diagnose the SEZ6 associated disorder. In selected embodiments the devices and associated methods will comprise the step of contacting at least one circulating tumor cell.
      Other preferred embodiments of the invention also exploit the properties of the disclosed modulators as an instrument useful for identifying, characterizing, isolating, sectioning or enriching populations or subpopulations of tumor initiating cells through methods such as flow cytometric analysis including fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) or laser mediated sectioning.
      As such, another preferred embodiment of the instant invention is directed to a method of identifying, isolating, sectioning or enriching a population of tumor initiating cells comprising the step of contacting said tumor initiating cells with a SEZ6 modulator.
      The foregoing is a summary and thus contains, by necessity, simplifications, generalizations, and omissions of detail; consequently, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. Other aspects, features, and advantages of the methods, compositions and/or devices and/or other subject matter described herein will become apparent in the teachings set forth herein. The summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002727012,"BACKGROUND
      Monoclonal antibodies of the IgG type contain two identical antigen-binding arms and a constant domain (Fc). Antibodies with a differing specificity in their binding arms usually do not occur in nature and, therefore, have to be crafted with the help of chemical engineering (e.g., chemical cross-linking, etc), recombinant DNA and/or cell-fusion technology.
      Bispecific antibodies can bind simultaneously two different antigens. This property enables the development of therapeutic strategies that are not possible with conventional monoclonal antibodies. The large panel of imaginative bispecific antibody formats that has been developed reflects the strong interest for these molecules. See Berg J, Lotscher E, Steimer K S, et al., “Bispecific antibodies that mediate killing of cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus of any strain,” Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1991) 88(11): 4723-4727 and Fischer N and Leger O., “Biospecific Antibodies: Molecules That Enable Novel Therapeutic Strategies,” Pathobiology (2007) 74:3-14.
      Another class of multispecific molecules is recombinant fusion proteins. Recombinant fusion proteins consisting of the extracellular domain of immunoregulatory proteins and the constant (Fc) domain of immunoglobulin (Ig) represent a growing class of human therapeutics. Immunoadhesins combine the binding region of a protein sequence, with a desired specificity, with the effector domain of an antibody. Immunoadhesins have two important properties that are significant to their potential as therapeutic agents: the target specificity, and the pharmacokinetic stability (half-life in vivo that is comparable to that of antibodies). Immunoadhesins can be used as antagonist to inhibit or block deleterious interactions or as agonist to mimic or enhance physiological responses. See Chamow S M, Zhang D Z, Tan X Y, et al., “A humanized, bispecific immunoadhesin-antibody that retargets CD3+ effectors to kill HIV-1-infected cells,” J Hematother 1995; 4(5): 439-446.
      Other multispecific molecules have been discussed elsewhere. Examples include but are not limited to: Fisher et al., Pathobiology (2007) 74:3-14 (review of various bispecific formats); U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843, issued Dec. 9, 2003 to Feige et al. (peptibodies); US Pat. Publ. No. 2002-004587 published Jan. 10, 2002 (multispecific antibodies); U.S. Pat. No. 7,612,181 issued Nov. 3, 2009 to Wu et al. (Dual Variable Domain format); U.S. Pat. No. 6,534,628, Nord K et al., Prot Eng (1995) 8:601-608, Nord K et al., Nat Biotech (1997) 15:772-777, and Grönwall et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem. (2008) June; 50(Pt 2):97-112 (Affibodies); Martens et al., Clin Cancer Res (2006), 12: 6144-6152 and Jin et al., Cancer Res (2008) 68(11):4360-4368 (one armed antibodies); Bostrom et al., Science (2009) 323:1610-1614 (Dual Action Fab, aka mixed valency antibodies). Other formats are known to those skilled in the art.
      The manufacturing of clinical grade material remains challenging for the multispecific molecules described above. As noted above, there are many paths to the production of molecules with mixed binding arms, i.e., binding arms that are not identical to each other. Each of these methods has its drawbacks.
      Chemical cross-linking is labor intensive as the relevant species may yet need to be purified from homodimers and other undesired by-products. In addition, the chemical modification steps can alter the integrity of the proteins thus leading to poor stability. Thus, this method is often inefficient and can lead to loss of antibody activity.
      Cell-fusion technology (e.g., hybrid hybridomas) express two heavy and two light chains that assemble randomly leading to the generation of 10 antibody combinations. The desired heteromultimeric antibodies are only a small fraction of the antibodies thus produced. Purification of the desired heteromultimeric proteins dramatically reduces production yields and increases manufacturing costs.
      Recombinant DNA techniques have been used to generate various heteromultimeric formats, e.g., single chain Fv, diabodies, etc., that do not comprise an Fc domain. A major drawback for this type of antibody molecule is the lack of the Fc domain and thus the ability of the antibody to trigger an effector function (e.g., complement activation, Fc-receptor binding etc.). Thus, a bispecific antibody comprising a functional Fc domain is desired.
      Recombinant DNA techniques have also been used to generate ‘knob into hole’ bispecific antibodies. See US Patent Application 20030078385 (Arathoon et al.—Genentech). One constraint of this strategy is that the light chains of the two parent antibodies have to be identical to prevent mispairing and formation of undesired and/or inactive molecules due to being expressed in the same cell.
      Thus, there remains a need for alternative methods of producing heteromultimeric proteins. The invention described herein provides such methods. These and other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002617958,"BACKGROUND
      Lignins are universal components in plants that form cross-links with carbohydrates, such as hemicelluloses in the cell wall. Lignin and cellulose are the two predominant components of the plant cell wall. The plant cell wall provides a natural barrier against the extracellular environment. Many studies have demonstrated that one of the responses of plants to biotic stresses (e.g., pathogenic infection) or abiotic stresses (e.g., drought, mechanical stress, etc.) consists of reinforcement of the plant cell wall, in particular by increasing the lignin content in the plant cell wall. Many agronomical or industrial applications concern desired plant products (e.g., products used in paper production, silage production, and the production of energy, for example, in the form of biofuels), the yields of which are directly linked to the content and/or composition of lignin in the plant cell wall.
      Lignin polymers limit the digestibility of the fiber in the corn plant. Lignin polymers lower fiber digestion in ruminants, and the degree of lignifications may be inversely proportional to forage crop digestibility. Cherney et al. (1991) Adv. Agron. 46:157-98. Modulation of lignin content and composition may be desirable to increase the digestibility of forage. Lignin content modulation may also be desirable, e.g., to reinforce plant walls, and thereby improve resistance to stresses; or conversely to weaken the plant wall in order to facilitate the extraction of cellulose or other chemical compounds. Baucher et al. (1998) Plant Mol. Biol. 39:437-47.
      It is, however, difficult to know how to modify the lignin biosynthesis pathway, and to predict what the consequences of modifications will be. This is at least in part because the lignin biosynthesis pathway is a complex pathway involving a large number of enzymatic reactions. See, e.g., Dixon et al. (2001) Phytochemistry 57(7):1069-84. Possible mechanisms by which the pathway may be altered physiologically, for example, to compensate for a change introduced by a modification in the pathway, are not known.
      Lignin is an insoluble polymer of 3 monomers of alcohols or monolignols: p-coumaryl alcohol (H subunits), coniferyl alcohol (G subunits), and sinapyl alcohol (S subunits), that are derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. Neish (1968) Constitution and Biosynthesis of Lignin, eds. New York, Springer Verlag 1-43. Each type of subunit can form a variety of bonds with others, and thereby constitute lignin. Other bonds may also be established with other parietal compounds (e.g., polysaccharides and proteins) so as to form a complex three-dimensional network.
      Steps in the complex lignin production pathway include hydroxylation, O-methylation of aromatic rings, and conversion of a carboxyl side chain to an alcohol function. The current hypothesis for the monolignol biosynthesis pathway includes successive hydroxylation and O-methylation reactions at various levels of oxidation of the side chains in a metabolic network, thereby resulting in the formation of S and G subunits. The enzymes of the network include caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT); hydroxyxinamate coenzyme A ligases (4CL); cytochrome P450-dependent ferulate 5-hydroxylases (F5Hs); and several isoforms of cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) and of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD).
      For several years, attempts have been made to modify the lignin content and composition of plants by over-expressing or under-expressing one or more genes of the lignin biosynthesis pathway. Anterola and Lewis (2002) Phytochemistry 61:221-94. Though various strategies have been imagined, the over-expression or under-expression of one or more enzymes in the lignin biosynthesis pathway does not always give reliable and predictable results.
      Another strategy consists of using, in selection schemes, mutants of a targeted gene in the lignin biosynthesis pathway. Plants containing a brown midrib (bmr) mutation exhibit altered lignin composition and digestibility. In corn, at least four independent brown midrib mutations have been identified. Kuc et al. (1968) Phytochemistry 7:1435-6. These mutations, termed “bm1, bm2, bm3, and bm4,” all exhibit decreased lignin content when compared to control corn. Brown midrib corn plants are characterized by a brown pigmentation in the leaf midrib at the V4 to V6 stage and a light brown coloration of the pith after tasselling. One characterized bmr mutation is an insertion mutation in the COMT enzyme (bm3).
      Mature bm1 maize plants have a lignin content that is reduced by 10-20%, a slight decrease in ferulic acid esters, and a substantially reduced content (˜40%) of p-coumaric esters and ferulic acid esters. Provan et al. (1997) J. Agric. Food 73:133-42; Barriére et al. (2004) Comptes Rendus Biologie 327:847-60. The frequency of p-hydroxyphenyl, guaiacyl, and syringyl thioacidolysis monomers is similar in bm1 and wild-type plants, showing that the bm1 mutation does not specifically affect a single type of lignin subunit. Guillaumie et al. (2007) Planta 226(1):235-50. Lignins of bm1 plants do appear to be substantially enriched in carbon-carbon inter-subunit linkages (Halpin et al. (1998) Plant J. 14(5):545-53; Barriére et al. (2004), supra), and bm1 lignins have substantial incorporation of coniferaldehyde and, to a lesser extent, of sinapaldehyde. Kim et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:47412-9.
      Agriculturally important uses of corn (maize) include silage. Silage is fermented, high-moisture fodder that can be fed to ruminants. It is fermented and stored in a process called ensilage or silaging, and is usually made from corn or other grass crops, including sorghum or other cereals, using the entire green plant. Bulk silage is commonly fed to dairy cattle, while baled silage tends to be used for beef cattle, sheep, and horses. Since silage goes through a fermentation process, energy is used by fermentative bacteria to produce volatile fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, lactate, and butyrate, which preserve the forage. The result is that the silage is lower in energy than the original forage, since the fermentative bacteria use some of the carbohydrates to produce the volatile fatty acids. Corn silage is a popular forage for ruminant animals because it is high in energy and digestibility and is easily adapted to mechanization from the stand-crop to time of feeding. Corn silage generally is slightly brown to dark green in color, and has a light, pleasant smell.
      The reduced lignin in brown midrib corn (bmr corn) results in silage with fiber that is more digestible than normal corn and exhibits an improved rate of biofuel conversion. Feeding bmr corn silage to lactating dairy cows has been shown to increase dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield. Grant et al. (1995) J. Dairy Sci. 78:1970-80; Oba and Allen (2000) J. Dairy Sci. 83:1333-41; Oba and Allen (1999) J. Dairy Sci. 82:135-42. However, bmr corn silage reduced average daily gain and feed efficiency (G:F) in beef cows, compared to corn silage from a conventional corn variety. Tjardes et al. (2000) J. Anim. Sci. 78:2957-65. Brown midrib hybrid corn lines are also frequently found to be low yielding. Brown midrib hybrid corn has also typically been associated with forage lodging and lack of standability.

Surprisingly, the complicated pathway of lignin biosynthesis is apparently altered in the presence of a mutant cad2 gene, such that plants containing a mutant cad2 gene have lignin levels that are lower than those found in wild-type plants. The characterization of mutant cad2 genes and identification of markers linked to mutant cad2 genes may greatly facilitate the development and deployment of reduced lignin phenotypes in plant germplasms.

      In particular embodiments, a mutant cad2 gene according to the disclosure may comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a truncated CAD2 protein. For example, a mutant cad2 gene comprising an insertion mutation in an exon (e.g., exon 3) or an intron (e.g., intron 1) of the cad2 gene may introduce a premature STOP codon that results in a shorter gene product. In some embodiments, a mutant cad2 gene according to the disclosure may comprise a naturally-occurring mutation in one or more maize lines. In some embodiments, a mutant cad2 gene is cloned from a known bmr corn variety; e.g., 515Dbm1. In other embodiments, a mutant cad2 gene is cloned from a previously unknown bmr corn variety; e.g., DASbm1. When expressed in a plant, a mutant cad2 gene according to the disclosure may result in a phenotype in the plant; for example, reduced levels of cad2 RNA in tissues of the plant, and/or reduced lignin content in tissues of the plant.
      Also described herein are methods of using nucleic acid molecular markers that are linked to or that reside within a mutant maize cad2 gene according to the disclosure, for example and without limitation: to identify plants having a reduced lignin phenotype; to introduce a mutant maize cad2 gene to new plant genotypes (e.g., through marker-assisted breeding or genetic transformation); to differentiate between wild-type CAD2 genes and particular mutant cad2 genes according to the disclosure; and to produce plants and plant seeds from crosses of a first plant comprising nucleic acid molecular markers that are linked to or that reside within a mutant maize cad2 gene according to the disclosure and a second plant optionally carrying a mutant maize cad2 gene. In some embodiments, a mutant maize cad2 gene is engineered into plant species other than maize.
      Further described are means for producing a genetically modified plant (e.g., maize) comprising a mutant maize cad2 gene, and means for identifying plants (e.g., maize) carrying a mutant maize cad2 gene. A means for producing a genetically modified plant comprising a mutant maize cad2 gene is a marker that is linked to or that resides within a mutant maize cad2 gene according to the disclosure. A means for identifying plants carrying a mutant maize cad2 gene is a probe that specifically hybridizes to a marker that is linked to or that resides within a mutant maize cad2 gene according to the disclosure.
      Methods are disclosed for increasing the meat quantity of a silage-fed animal, for example by increasing the gain to feed ratio (G:F) for corn silage. In some embodiments, a method for increasing the meat quantity of a silage-fed animal may comprise providing plant material obtained from maize comprising a mutant maize cad2 gene according to the disclosure, using the plant material for the production of corn silage, and incorporation of the corn silage in a finishing ration for feeding to a ruminant. Thus, meat and meat products produced from an animal fed a finishing ration according to the disclosure or according to a method the disclosure are also provided.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002661111,"BACKGROUND
      Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads (NTs) are the major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). NTs are composed of the microtubule-associated Tau protein that has undergone posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, and develop by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated Tau conformers. AD shares this pathology with many neurodegenerative tauopathies, in particularly with certain types of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tau protein appears to be a major player in the cognitive demise in AD and related neurodegenerative tauopathies.
      Therapeutic approaches that target Tau protein are scarce and comprise mainly inhibitors of the kinases that are thought to increase the phosphorylation of Tau to pathological levels, and compounds that block the cytoplasmic aggregation of hyper-phosphorylated Tau protein. These approaches suffer various draw-backs of specificity and efficacy. Mouse antibodies that bind to phosphorylated pathological Tau conformers have been described previously, e.g., in WO 2012/045882. However, there is still a need for additional passive and/or active immunotherapies that work to counteract the pathological protein conformers that are known or presumed to cause neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyloid pathology in AD caused, for example, by intra-neuronal aggregates of hyperphosphorylated protein Tau that are as typical for AD as amyloid.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002639505,"BACKGROUND ART
      Antibodies are proteins produced by the B-lymphocytes of the immune system in response to antigens, recognize antigens and bind to antigens. Such antibodies are regarded as new protein drug candidates for treating diseases. To find desired functional antibodies, various antibody libraries are constructed, and the functional antibodies are screened from antibody libraries. Such antibody libraries are constructed using gene recombination technology. Specifically, genes encoding antibody proteins are extracted from B-cells in the human body to construct antibody gene libraries, and antibodies having desired antigen binding specificity are screened from the libraries. Antibody library technology brought about a revolution in the construction of antibodies such as human antibodies. The most prominent characteristic of antibody immune responses is that antibody binding specifically to a kind or shape of antigen could be made within one week, if the antigen is a foreign substance different from an in vivo component. Antibodies are produced by B-lymphocytes, and a single B lymphocyte produces only one type of antibody. In fact, it is known that numerous B lymphocytes exist in the human body, and each B lymphocyte expresses an antibody having unique antigen binding specificity on the cell membrane. It is generally known that an antigen binding diversity of about 10 8 exists in the human body. When an antigen invades the body, only B lymphocytes expressing an antibody that binds specifically to the antigen proliferate rapidly while producing a large amount of the antibody, and as a result, the concentration of the antibody in the serum increases rapidly to thereby quickly eliminate the invaded antigen. Thus, an antibody diversity of several hundred millions exists in the human body, and this antibody diversity is referred to as repertoire. Thus, when a sufficient number of B lymphocytes are collected from the human body by blood collection, after which mRNA is isolated from the cells and synthesized into cDNA encoding the heavy-chain and light-chain variable regions of antibody by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction), a human antibody repertoire can be constructed in vitro in the form of genes in a relatively simple manner. The key of antibody library technology is to express (or display) this human antibody gene repertoire as protein while paring a gene encoding the antibody protein through any medium (genotype-phenotype linkage), thereby testing an antibody binding to a specific antigen screened from the antibody library and obtaining a gene encoding the specific antibody. Herein, perfect immunity is not required, the repertoire is either displayed as Fab of an antibody having antigen binding function, or displayed as an antibody fragment, named scFv (single-chain variable fragment) in which the heavy-chain and light-chain variable domains (V H and V L) are connected to each other by a short peptide linker of about 15 amino acids. Herein, the display is classified into phage display, ribosome display, yeast display and the like according to the kind of medium that is used in the genotype-phenotype linkage, and an antibody having desired antigen binding characteristics can be obtained without inducing an immune response by administration of an antigen. However, there are shortcomings in that a lot of know-how is required for antibody library construction and antibody screening, it is not easy to obtain high-affinity antibodies, and thus antibody optimization procedures such as affinity maturation are frequently performed after antibody screening, and functional analysis in mammalian cells cannot be performed due to problems such as toxicity, particularly during first-step screening. Such shortcomings have become a barrier for the development of therapeutic antibodies, because therapeutic antibodies do not simply bind to antigens but should have therapeutic functions.
      Among antibody libraries, phage display antibody libraries are currently most frequently used. In fact, Humira (anti-TNF-alpha human monoclonal antibody) which is a currently commercially available rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic agent is a therapeutic antibody made by phage display technology. An ideal antibody library contains enormous antibody diversity, and thus high-affinity antibody clones having desired antigen binding specificity can be screened therefrom. For this purpose, a library having an antibody library of about 10 10-10 11 should be constructed. However, it is very difficult to construct a library having this size by antibody gene cloning, and this is considered as the most difficult problem in the construction of phage display antibody libraries. In addition, there is a shortcoming in that functional analysis cannot be directly performed, because phages themselves act to be toxic. The biggest advantage of ribosome display technology is a cell-free system, and thus theoretically, libraries having a large size of 10 13 can be easily constructed by ribosome display technology. Thus, ribosome display technology is advantageous for the screening of high-affinity antibodies (generally, the size of an antibody library becomes larger, the possibility for high-affinity antibodies to be contained in the library is higher). In addition, because PCR amplification is performed in ribosome display technology, error-prone polymerase or the like can be used, and thus the introduction of mutation for artificially inducing is very easy. However, ribosome display technology also has toxicity problems and various experimental problems. For this reason, phage display technology is mainly used for the construction of antibody libraries of naive origin. In yeast display technology, there are many technical limitations in making antibody libraries having a diversity of 10 9 or more, because a process of inserting a recombinant vector into a S. cerevisiae strain is required and the size of yeast cells is large. Thus, yeast display technology is mainly used to construct a mutant library of already established antigen-specific antibodies and to screen high-affinity antibodies from the mutant library.
      However, in such antibody libraries, all antibodies are not individually separated, but are mixed together. Such antibody libraries have limitations in that screening of an antibody to a target antigen based on its function (activity) is not actually impossible, and only screening of an antibody based on binding to an antibody is possible. Initial antibody candidates obtained in this procedure are examined for their function in a subsequent step to select antibodies having functions. In most cases, antibodies, which easily bind but have no function, are obtained in the selection step. Thus, a new method that overcomes the limitation of this screening method is required. In other words, a method of screening antibodies based on their function from beginning is required. However, existing libraries are in a state in which various antibodies are mixed together, and it is impossible to screen individual antibodies based on its function. Thus, if it is possible to individually purify and store all antibodies in specially addressed library, like low-molecular-weight compound libraries, it is possible to screen antibodies based on their function. However, because antibodies are proteins, processes for expressing and purifying antibodies are required, and thus it is actually impossible to construct a library of 100,000 or 1,000,000 different antibodies. In other words, conventional methods have shortcomings in that, when the library diversity is assumed to be 1,000,000, the purification of 1,000,000 proteins is required, and the number of required protein purifications increases by exponentially as the diversity increases. Conventional library construction technologies include a technology of constructing a library by combining V H and V L at the DNA level in a vector (U.S. Pat. No. 8,178,320), a technology of constructing a library of antibody light chains and heavy chains at the DNA level (U.S. Pat. No. 7,858,559), etc. However, these library construction technologies have shortcomings in that the purification of a desired number of proteins is required to construct a library having a diversity satisfying a combination of the proteins at the DNA level, and the functions of the antibodies in the constructed library cannot be immediately analyzed due to the geometric number of the antibodies, and for this reason, an additional step of reducing the number of antibodies, which can be screened by binding to antigens and analyzed for their function, is required, and a true important antibody can be missed during this screening. Particularly, in conventional library construction methods, Fvs should be expressed in combination at the DNA level, and thus the purification of proteins corresponding to the library diversity is required. Thus, in the conventional library construction methods, it is impossible to construct a library containing individually separated antibodies.
      Under such circumstances, the present inventors have made extensive efforts to develop a library in which antibodies are individually separated so that they can be functionally screened. As a result, the present inventors have paid attention to the construction of library, in which combinations happened at the protein level, unlike conventional library construction technologies of combining antibody domains at the DNA level, and have found that an Fv library based on a combination of proteins can be constructed by combining V H and V L at the protein level, thereby completing the present invention.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200601946,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Cancer is the second leading cause of human death next to coronary disease. Worldwide, millions of people die from cancer every year. In the United States alone, as reported by the American Cancer Society, cancer causes the death of well over a half-million people annually, with over 1.2 million new cases diagnosed per year. While deaths from heart disease have been declining significantly, those resulting from cancer generally are on the rise. In the early part of the next century, cancer is predicted to become the leading cause of death.
      Worldwide, several cancers stand out as the leading killers. In particular, carcinomas of the lung, prostate, breast, colon, pancreas, ovary, and bladder represent the primary causes of cancer death. These and virtually all other carcinomas share a common lethal feature. With very few exceptions, metastatic disease from a carcinoma is fatal. Moreover, even for those cancer patients who initially survive their primary cancers, common experience has shown that their lives are dramatically altered. Many cancer patients experience strong anxieties driven by the awareness of the potential for recurrence or treatment failure. Many cancer patients experience physical debilitations following treatment. Furthermore, many cancer patients experience a recurrence.
      Worldwide, prostate cancer is the fourth most prevalent cancer in men. In North America and Northern Europe, it is by far the most common cancer in males and is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. In the United States alone, well over 30,000 men die annually of this disease—second only to lung cancer. Despite the magnitude of these figures, there is still no effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Surgical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, hormone ablation therapy, surgical castration and chemotherapy continue to be the main treatment modalities. Unfortunately, these treatments are ineffective for many and are often associated with undesirable consequences.
      On the diagnostic front, the lack of a prostate tumor marker that can accurately detect early-stage, localized tumors mains a significant limitation in the diagnosis and management of this disease. Although the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) assay has been a very useful tool, however its specificity and general utility is widely regarded as lacking in several important respects.
      Progress in identifying additional specific markers for prostate cancer has been improved by the generation of prostate cancer xenografts that can recapitulate different stages of the disease in mice. The LAPC (Los Angeles Prostate Cancer) xenografts are prostate cancer xenografts that have survived passage in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice and have exhibited the capacity to mimic the transition from androgen dependence to androgen independence (Klein et al., 1997, Nat. Med. 3:402). More recently identified prostate cancer markers include PCTA-1 (Su et al., 1996, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93: 7252), prostate-specific membrane (PSM) antigen (Pinto et al., Clin Cancer Res 1996 Sep. 2 (9): 1445-51), STEAP (Hubert, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1999 Dec. 7; 96 (25): 14523-8) and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) (Reiter et al., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 1735).
      While previously identified markers such as PSA, PSM, PCTA and PSCA have facilitated efforts to diagnose and treat prostate cancer, there is need for the identification of additional markers and therapeutic targets for prostate and related cancers in order to further improve diagnosis and therapy.
      Renal tell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3 percent of adult malignancies. Once adenomas reach a diameter of 2 to 3 cm, malignant potential exists. In the adult, the two principal malignant renal tumors are renal cell adenocarcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis or ureter. The incidence of renal cell adenocarcinoma is estimated at more than 29,000 cases in the United States, and more than 11,600 patients died of this disease in 1998. Transitional cell carcinoma is less frequent, with an incidence of approximately 500 cases per year in the United States.
      Surgery has been the primary therapy for renal cell adenocarcinoma for many decades. Until recently, metastatic disease has been refractory to any systemic therapy. With recent developments in systemic therapies, particularly immunotherapies, metastatic renal cell carcinoma may be approached aggressively in appropriate patients with a possibility of durable responses. Nevertheless, there is a remaining need for effective therapies for these patients.
      Of all new cases of cancer in the United States, bladder cancer represents approximately 5 percent in men (fifth most common neoplasm) and 3 percent in women (eighth most common neoplasm). The incidence is increasing slowly, concurrent with an increasing older population. In 1998, there was an estimated 54,500 cases, including 39,500 in men and 15,000 in women. The age-adjusted incidence in the United States is 32 per 100,000 for men and eight per 100,000 in women. The historic male/female ratio of 3:1 may be decreasing related to smoking patterns in women. There were an estimated 11,000 deaths from bladder cancer in 1998 (7,800 in men and 3,900 in women). Bladder cancer incidence and mortality strongly increase with age and will be an increasing problem as the population becomes more elderly.
      Most bladder cancers recur in the bladder. Bladder cancer is managed with a combination of transurethral resection of the bladder (TUR) and intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The multifocal and recurrent nature of bladder cancer points out the limitations of TUR. Most muscle-invasive cancers are not cured by TUR alone. Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is the most effective means to eliminate the cancer but carry an undeniable impact on urinary and sexual function. There continues to be a significant need for treatment modalities that are beneficial for bladder cancer patients.
      An estimated 130,200 cases of colorectal cancer occurred in 2000 in the United States, including 93,800 cases of colon cancer and 36,400 of rectal cancer. Colorectal cancers are the third most common cancers in men and women. Incidence rates declined significantly during 1992-1996 (−2.1% per year). Research suggests that these declines have been due to increased screening and polyp removal, preventing progression of polyps to invasive cancers. There were an estimated 56,300 deaths (47,700 from colon cancer, 8,600 from rectal cancer) in 2000, accounting for about 11% of all U.S. cancer deaths.
      At present, surgery is the most common form of therapy for colorectal cancer, and for cancers that have not spread, it is frequently curative. Chemotherapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation, is given before or after surgery to most patients whose cancer has deeply perforated the bowel wall or has spread to the lymph nodes. A permanent colostomy (creation of an abdominal opening for elimination of body wastes) is occasionally needed for colon cancer and is infrequently required for rectal cancer. There continues to be a need for effective diagnostic and treatment modalities for colorectal cancer.
      There were an estimated 164,100 new cases of lung and bronchial cancer in 2000, accounting for 14% of all U.S. cancer diagnoses. The incidence rate of lung and bronchial cancer is declining significantly in men, from a high of 86.5 per 100,000 in 1984 to 70.0 in 1996. In the 1990s, the rate of increase among women began to slow. In 1996, the incidence rate in women was 42.3 per 100,000.
      Lung and bronchial cancer caused an estimated 156,900 deaths in 2000, accounting for 28% of all cancer deaths. During 1992-1996, mortality from lung cancer declined significantly among men (−1.7% per year) while rates for women were still significantly increasing (0.9% per year). Since 1987, more women have died each year of lung cancer than breast cancer, which, for over 40 years, was the major cause of cancer death in women. Decreasing lung cancer incidence and mortality rates most likely resulted from decreased smoking rates over the previous 30 years; however, decreasing smoking patterns among women lag behind those of men. Of concern, although the declines in adult tobacco use have slowed, tobacco use in youth is increasing again.
      Treatment options for lung and bronchial cancer are determined by the type and stage of the cancer and include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. For many localized cancers, surgery is usually the treatment of choice. Because the disease has usually spread by the time it is discovered, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are often needed in combination with surgery. Chemotherapy alone or combined with radiation is the treatment of choice for small cell lung cancer; on this regimen, a large percentage of patients experience remission, which in some cases is long lasting. There is however, an ongoing need for effective treatment and diagnostic approaches for lung and bronchial cancers.
      An estimated 182,800 new invasive cases of breast cancer were expected to occur among women in the United States during 2000. Additionally, about 1,400 new cases of breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in men in 2000. After increasing about 4% per year in the 1980s, breast cancer incidence rates in women have leveled off in the 1990s to about 110.6 cases per 100,000.
      In the U.S. alone, there were an estimated 41,200 deaths (40,800 women, 400 men) in 2000 due to breast cancer. Breast cancer ranks second among cancer deaths in women. According to the most recent data, mortality rates declined significantly during 1992-1996 with the largest decreases in younger women, both white and black. These decreases were probably the result of earlier detection and improved treatment.
      Taking into account the medical circumstances and the patients preferences, treatment of breast cancer may involve lumpectomy (local removal of the tumor) and removal of the lymph nodes under the arm; mastectomy (surgical removal of the breast) and removal of the lymph nodes under the arm; radiation therapy; chemotherapy; or hormone therapy. Often, two or more methods are used in combination. Numerous studies have shown that, for early stage disease, long-term survival rates after lumpectomy plus radiotherapy are similar to survival rates after modified radical mastectomy. Significant advances in reconstruction techniques provide several options for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Recently, such reconstruction has been done at the same time as the mastectomy.
      Local excision of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with adequate amounts of surrounding normal breast tissue may prevent the local recurrence of the DCIS. Radiation to the breast and/or tamoxifen may reduce the chance of DCIS occurring in the remaining breast tissue. This is important because DCIS, if left untreated, may develop into invasive breast cancer. Nevertheless, there are serious side effects or sequelae to these treatments. There is, therefore, a need for efficacious breast cancer treatments.
      There were an estimated 23,100 new cases of ovarian cancer in the United States in 2000. It accounts for 4% of all cancers among women and ranks second among gynecologic cancers. During 1992-1996, ovarian cancer incidence rates were significantly declining. Consequent to ovarian cancer, there were an estimated 14,000 deaths in 2000. Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
      Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are treatment options for ovarian cancer. Surgery usually includes the removal of one or both ovaries, the fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy), and the uterus (hysterectomy). In some very early tumors, only the involved ovary will be removed, especially in young women who wish to have children. In advanced disease, an attempt is made to remove all intra-abdominal disease to enhance the effect of chemotherapy. There continues to be an important need for effective treatment options for ovarian cancer.
      There were an estimated 28,300 new cases of pancreatic cancer in the United States in 2000. Over the past 20 years, rates of pancreatic cancer have declined in men. Rates among women have remained approximately constant but may be beginning to decline. Pancreatic cancer caused an estimated 28,200 deaths in 2000 in the United States. Over the past 20 years, there has been a slight but significant decrease in mortality rates among men (about −0.9% per year) while rates have increased slightly among women.
      Surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy are treatment options for pancreatic cancer. These treatment options can extend survival and/or relieve symptoms in many patients but are not likely to produce a cure for most. There is a significant need for additional therapeutic and diagnostic options for cancers. These include the use of antibodies, vaccines, and small molecules as treatment modalities. Additionally, there is also a need to use these modilities as research tools to diagnose, detect, monitor, and further the state of the art in all areas of cancer treatment and studies.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002684277,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Digestion of dietary proteins is achieved by the release of proteases from the stomach and the pancreas. The release of proteases is normally tightly regulated, thereby ensuring that not too less and not too much proteolytic enzymes are secreted. This is important since a high release of proteases and a high proteolytic activity has several disadvantages. A too high release of proteases will result in energy loss and a loss of essential amino acids due to the fact that proteases themselves are highly resistant to proteolytic activity and will enter into the colon mostly unaltered. Subsequently, upon entering of an increased amount of protein (in the form of proteases) into the colon, the intestinal microbiota will ferment the proteins resulting in a disadvantageously higher pH, a shift in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and formation of toxic metabolites such as phenol, indol, and amines. This change in colonic physiology may also lead to increased intestinal infections. Finally, proteases such as trypsin are known to cleave protease activated receptors (PARs), such as PAR-II, and thereby disrupt intestinal barrier integrity. This may result in an increased abdominal pain perception. Inflammatory diseases such as IBS-D and UC have been linked to elevated levels of proteolytic activity within the intestinal lumen and subsequent PAR-II activation. Furthermore, increased faecal proteolytic activity is linked to diaper rashes. In general, a too high release of proteases will result in decreasing gastrointestinal comfort, functional digestive disorders, gastrointestinal gas formation, and/or bloating.
      A too low secretion of proteolytic activity, on the other hand, is disadvantageous since in that case the dietary proteins are not properly digested leading also to loss of essential amino acids and energy, and an increased protein load of the colon.
      Especially in infants and toddlers a tight regulation of protein digestion and release of proteolytic activity is of utmost importance. Firstly, for infants and toddlers a limited loss of protein is essential for good growth and development. Loss of essential amino acids and energy impairs growth and development. Secondly, the intestinal barrier function in infants and toddlers is still immature and the intestinal microbiota is still developing and therefore more susceptible for the disadvantages mentioned above. Pain perception e.g. due to colics or cramps often is a great cause of concern and initiates many doctor visits and thus reduction of the risk of pain perception, for example prevention and/or treatment of colics and/or cramps is desired.
      Known ways to improve protein digestion, in particular in infants, involve partial predigestion of dietary proteins by proteases. Furthermore, Alm, 1982, J Dairy Sci 65:509-514 discloses that a low pH of milk products, especially as a result of fermentation, has a positive influence on in vitro digestibility of proteins. It is considered that in many digestive disorders the secretion of hydrochloric acid is impaired and thus the suitability of such low pH milk products is suggested for infants, children and adults. Vass et al, 1984, Acta Medica Hungarica, 41, 15-161 disclose that fermented milks have the highest protein utilization index, defined as increase in body mass in g per protein intake in g, in weaning rats, and this is attributed to a better digestibility of proteins.
      Gallia Lactofidus® is an acidified infant formula, resulting from fermentation by two specific strains of lactic acid bacteria. It is disclosed that this formula facilitates the digestibility of proteins and improves the intestinal transit.
      WO 2009/151330 discloses fermented infant formula with non digestible oligosaccharides for use in improving intestinal colonization in infants born via Caesarean section.
      US 2011/097437 discloses nutritional compositions comprising non-digestible oligosaccharides and a protein substrate fermented with Bifidobacterium breve and Streptococcus thermophilus for use in reduction of bacterial translocation and improvement of intestinal barrier function.
      US 2010/278781 discloses a protein comprising composition, fermented by Bifidobacterium breve and comprising non-digestible oligosaccharides with several health benefits.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The inventors have found that, employing piglets as animal model, upon consumption of a fermented formula the amount of endogenous proteolytic enzymes detected at the terminal ileum was significantly reduced compared to the amount detected upon consumption of a standard non fermented formula. Surprisingly, the amount of endogenous proteolytic enzymes was also significantly reduced compared to the amount detected upon consumption of a formula with extensively hydrolysed (i.e. predigested) proteins.
      In addition and unexpectedly as well, the apparent and true protein digestibility was the highest in the piglets consuming the fermented formula as well, even though their daily protein intake was higher. This is indicative for a decreased digestive effort. Digestive effort is defined as the amount of protease activity secreted per gram of ingested protein. Digestive efficiency is defined as reciprocal value of digestive effort. This means that at high digestive efficiency (little protease needed to digest the ingested protein) the digestive effort is low.
      The inventors further found that the proteolytic activity in faecal samples of exclusively breast fed human infants was lower than that of infants fed with a standard formula. When the formula administered to the human infants comprised non digestible oligosaccharides the proteolytic activity in the faecal samples was lower with similar values as observed for the breast fed human infants.
      So, upon feeding a protein comprising fermented formula, the release of endogenous protease, digestive effort, endogenous protein loss in the small intestine and the protein load entering the colon is advantageously reduced. The additional presence of non digestible oligosaccharides reduces the proteolytic activity of the microbiota in the colon. Hence an infant or toddler formula being both fermented and comprising non digestible oligosaccharides will have a further improved effect on reducing protein fermentation and proteolytic activity in the colon. Moreover, an infant or toddler formula being both fermented and comprising non digestible oligosaccharides will have a beneficial effect regarding proteolytic activity reduction along the entire, i.e. both small and large, intestinal tract. Therefore a fermented formula comprising non digestible oligosaccharides is advantageously used as nutrition for infants or toddlers for use in preventing and/or treatment of diaper rashes or in promoting intestinal tract health by reducing digestive effort, improving protein digestion efficiency, reducing endogenous protein loss, reducing endogenous secretion of proteases, reducing colonic protein fermentation and/or reducing the protein load entering the colon.
      The finding that protein digestion efficiency is increased, and endogenous protein loss is decreased also advantageously enables the formulation of an infant [or toddler] formula with lower protein concentrations than used so far.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002627156,"BACKGROUND ART
       Neisseria meningitidis is the cause of epidemic bacterial meningitis. Capsular polysaccharide is a major virulence determinant of N. meningitidis. Among the 13 meningococcal serogroups classified based on capsular polysaccharide structure, serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are associated with the majority of cases of meningococcal disease. In the African meningitis belt most large epidemics have been caused by serogroup A meningococci, whereas sporadic disease and outbreaks in developed countries are usually caused by serogroup B and C meningococci. Serogroup Y meningococci emerged as an important cause of sporadic disease and outbreaks in the United States in the late 1990s, and in 2000 serogroup W135 meningococci caused worldwide disease in association with the Hajj pilgrimage and large outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa.
      Serogroup X Neisseria meningitidis (MenX), previously a rare cause of sporadic cases of meningitis, has recently been associated with increased incidence of meningococcal disease and has emerged as a cause of large outbreaks in the “Meningitis Belt” of Africa. Outbreaks have been documented in Niger, Burkina Faso, Togo and Ghana and have varied in size. In the meningitis season of 2010 over 6500 meningitis cases were reported in Burkina Faso, and it is reasonable to assume that at least 1000 of these cases were due to MenX with a locally reported incidence of 120 cases per 100,000. Earlier, several patients were confirmed with MenX disease in an outbreak of at least 82 cases of bacterial meningitis on the border of Kenya and Uganda in 2007.
      The capsular polysaccharides of serogroup B, C, Y, and W135 meningococci are composed of sialic acid derivatives. Serogroup B and C meningococci express (α2-8)- and (α2-9)-linked polysialic acid, respectively, while alternating sequences of D-glucose or D-galactose and sialic acid are expressed by serogroup Y and W135 N. meningitidis. In contrast, the capsule of serogroup A meningococci is composed of (α1-6)-linked N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate, while N. meningitidis serogroup X synthesizes capsular polymers of (α1-4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate.
      The increase in incidence of MenX disease in African Meningitis Belt in the last 5 years warrants development and introduction of a MenX vaccine in selected areas of the region to prevent and control future epidemics. The conjugation of meningococcal capsular polysaccharides to a carrier protein has led to the development of monovalent (A or C) polysaccharide conjugate vaccines with high effectiveness, and immunogenicity data from clinical trials indicate that wide use of tetravalent conjugate vaccines covering serogroups A, C, Y and W-135 may be similarly effective. A similar approach may also be fruitful for MenX. Refer Ouli Xiea et al “Characterization of size, structure and purity of serogroup X Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharide, and development of an assay for quantification of human antibodies”, Vaccine 30, 2012.
      Gunnstein Norheim discusses that at present vaccine against serogroup X is not available and that next generation affordable vaccines should target most prevalent serogroups: A, W-135, X. Refer “Preventing the emerging serogroup X meningococcal disease in the African. Meningitis Belt” Oxford Vaccine Group, 2011.
      The lack of a vaccine against group X meningococci is a cause for concern given the outbreaks caused by meningococci of this serogroup in the past few years. Refer “Meningococcal vaccines: WHO position paper”, November 2011.
      In order to facilitate Men X polysaccharide based conjugate vaccine development, it is necessary to obtain structurally intact Men X polysaccharides with higher yields.
      Several synthetic media were discovered for large-scale production of meningococcal polysaccharide (Frantz, I. D. Jr. Growth Requirements of the Meningococcus. J. Bact., 43: 757-761, 1942; Catlin, B. W. Nutritional profiles of Neisseria lactamica, gonorrhoeae and meningitidis, in chemically defined media. J. Inf.

Polysaccharide production in batch process of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C comparing Frantz, modified Frantz and Catlin 6 cultivation media, Braz. J. Microbiol. vol. 34., no. 1. São Paulo January/April 2003).
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,494,808 reports a large-scale, high-cell density (5 g/L dry cell weight, and an optical density of between about 10-13 at 600 nm) fermentation process for the cultivation of N. meningitidis(serogroup B 11). This patent disclose the following medium (called “MC.6”) for culturing Neisseria meningitidis for isolation of OMPC (“Outer Membrane Protein Complex”)
      U.S. Pat. No. 7,399,615 discloses a fermentation composition wherein the composition omits NH 4Cl, and an improved method′ of fermenting Neisseria(serogroups A, C, Y & W135) in a fermentation composition replaces ammonium chloride(nitrogen source) with a soy peptone(HSP-A; Nutricepts, Inc; Minneapolis, Minn.). The said fed batch fermentation(2 L), wherein the fermentation medium as well as feed solution contains HSP-A results in Men A polysaccharide yield of about 1300-1400 mg/l at an average max OD between 14-20.
      U.S. Pat. No. 7,491,517 discloses a Neisseria meningitidis fastidious culture medium (NMFM) for producing capsular polysaccharides from Neisseria meningitidis(serogroups A, C, Y & W135) comprising: DI (deionizer) water, NaCl, K 2SO 4, KCl, trisodium citrate.2H 2O, MgSO 4.7H 2O, MnSO 4.H 2O, MnCl 2.6H 2O, vitamin. B12, NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) thiamine HCl, soy peptone, D-glucose, L-glutamic acid, L-arginine, L-serine, L-cysteine, glycine, morpholinepropanesulphonic acid [MOPS], CaCO 3 to maintain pH at 6.5 to 7.0 and Fe 2(SO 4) 3 for serogroup A and NH 4Cl for serogroup W-135. The said fermentation results in polysaccharide yield of about 30-40 mg/L at an average max OD of 10.
      David Bundle et al discusses preparation and isolation of Men X polysaccharide from N. meningitidis strain 247 X(Laboratory Center for Disease Control) wherein said strain was grown on a chemically defined medium (NCDM) for 18 hours. The said fermentation results in Men X polysaccharide yield of about 20 mg/L. Refer “Studies on the Group-specific Polysaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis Serogroup X and an improved Procedure for its isolation” JBC, 1974.
      Ouli Xiea et al discloses preparation of MenX PS from strains BF7/07 and BF12/03. Briefly, the MenX strains were grown on Brain Heart Infusion agarplates with Levinthals' supplement, and following a pre-culturestep in 0.2 L Franz medium, the strain was cultivated in four separate 2.8 L baffled shaking flasks containing 1.0 or 1.5 L modified Franz liquid medium each. Liquid cultures were inactivated after 16 h of growth by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). MenX PS yield per liter of growth medium appeared to be slightly higher for isolate BF 7/07 (4.5 mg/L) than for isolate BF12/03 (3.8 mg/L). Refer “Characterization of size, structure and purity of serogroup X Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharide, and development of an assay for quantification of human antibodies”, Vaccine 30, 2012.
      Prior art discusses structural and yield improvement studies with respect to polysaccharides from serogroups Men A, C, Y & W135. However none of the prior art addresses the long felt need for preparation of Men X polysaccharide with higher yield which is a prerequisite for development of Men X plain polysaccharide and Men X polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccines.
      Present inventors have found that prior art feeding strategies based on pH stat, spiking and constant rate which are suitable for Men A C Y W135 fermentation, however suffer from following setbacks for Men X: i) satisfactory growth but less polysaccharide yield ii) growth limiting, less polysaccharide yield and iii) satisfactory growth but early decline phase. Further prior art methods employ soya peptone & yeast extract as feed medium components that result in lower polysaccharide yield associated with increased load of protein contaminants.
      It is an object of the present invention to provide improved culture, fermentation and purification conditions for preparing Neisseria meningitidis X polysaccharides with high yield and minimum impurities With said improvements, Men X polysaccharide protein conjugate vaccine manufacturing can be economical and subsequently vaccine can be made available to children of developing countries at an affordable rate.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      Present invention arises from the surprising finding that it is possible to prepare Men X polysaccharide with high yields and high purity by utilizing a) a fermentation medium containing casamino acid along with other components, b) novel continuous exponential feeding strategy and feed medium composition that can result in delaying the decline phase, c) optimal fermenter conditions and d) improved purification process devoid of chromatographic methods.

0002737530,"BACKGROUND
      Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a β-herpesvirus, is a ubiquitously occurring pathogen. In an immunocompetent person, HCMV infection is normally unnoticed, having at most mild and nonspecific symptoms. By contrast, certain risk groups, for example in immunosuppressed patients such as AIDS patients or transplant recipients, and after prenatal infection, HCMV infection has serious manifestations (Staras S A et al., 2006 Clin Infect Dis 43(9):1143-51; Hebart H et al., 2004 Hum Immunol 65(5):432-6; Rowshani A T et al., 2005 Transplantation 79(4):381-6). Existing therapies include the use of immunoglobulins and anti-viral agents such as ganciclovir and its derivatives, which are most effective when used prophylactically or very early during infection in at risk populations. However, existing therapies are characterized by significant toxicity and limited efficacy, especially for late-onset disease (Boeckh M., 2004 Pediatr Transplant 8(Suppl. 5):19-27; Limaye A P., 2004 Transplantation 78(9):1390-6), and they have not had an impact on congenital HCMV disease. Development of an effective vaccine to protect against HCMV disease is recognized as an important public health priority (Arvin μM et al., 2004 Clin Infect Dis 39(2):233-9).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002487890,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Group B Streptococcus ( Streptococcus agalactiae) (GBS) is the major cause of invasive bacterial infections, including meningitis, in the neonatal period. In the United States alone, there are now about 5000 cases per year of invasive disease caused by this bacterium. These infections have an overall mortality of about 10%, and many of the infants that survive have permanent neurological sequelae. In view of this, a large effort has been made to find methods of prevention and treatment and to analyze the mechanisms by which GBS cause infections.
      The GBS can also cause mastitis in cows, a bovine disease that is of considerable economical importance. Development of a vaccine against GBS infections is therefore of interest also in veterinary medicine.
      About 20% of all women are vaginal carriers of GBS, and vertical transmission from the maternal genital tract is probably the most common source of infection in neonatal disease caused by this bacterium. However, only about 1% of the infants that are colonized by the GBS at birth are afflicted by serious infection. Other factors than exposure to the bacterium during birth must therefore contribute to the development of neonatal disease.
      Group B streptococcal strains are divided into nine serotypes (Ia, Ib, and II-VIII) based on the structure of the polysaccharide capsule (Baker, J Inf Dis 1990. 161: 917). The four “classical” serotypes Ia, Ib, II, and III occur in roughly equal proportions among strains in the normal flora, but type III is the clinically most important serotype, in particular because it causes most cases of meningitis.
      Because the capsule is a known virulence factor, it has been studied in considerable detail, in particular in type III strains. Efforts have been made to develop a vaccine, in which the type III polysaccharide capsule would be an essential component.
      EP 0 866 133 discloses a vaccine capable of protecting a recipient from infection caused by group B Streptococcus. The invention is directed to the use of a combination of a polysaccharide and a fragment of the epsilon protein. It further discloses that epidemiological data suggest that the type-specific capsule plays an important role in the immunity to group B Streptococcus infections (se page 7 line 2-3). Additionally, there are a number of different combinations between different proteins and the polysaccharide mentioned within the application but all the claims comprise a polysaccharide which shows the importance of that particular component. However, use of the polysaccharide capsule as a vaccine may give problems due to cross reactions with human tissues (Pritchard et al., Infect Immun 1992. 60: 1598). It would therefore be very valuable if one could develop a vaccine based on proteins rather than on polysaccharides.
      The document Gravekamp et al., Infection and Immunity, December 1997, p 5216-5221 discloses the evaluation of the immunogenicity as well as protection of the number of repeats of the alpha (α) C protein as well as the N-terminal part alone. It was found that the immunogenicity decreased with increasing number of repeats (se FIG. 2B). However, it was also found in a protection assay that the antibodies against the repeat region were predominantly responsible for the protection compared to antibodies against the N-terminal region (see page 5219 left column, line 6 from the bottom, and page 5220 right column lines 26-29).
      WO 9410317 describes the use of the alpha protein, a GBS surface protein, in the development of a conjugate vaccine. A drawback with this protein is that it usually is not expressed by type III strains, which are the cause of many serious GBS infections. Hence, a protective immunity against these strains will not be evoked by an alpha protein vaccine.
      WO 9421685 describes the use of the Rib protein, a GBS surface protein, in the development of a vaccine. This protein elicits immunity when administered with alum. However, the Rib protein has the disadvantage that it does not evoke a protective immunity against all GBS strains.
      Currently, as stated above, a vaccine suitable for prevention of GBS disease is not yet available, although much work has been devoted to this problem. Clearly, at present there is a long felt but unmet need to develop methods of prevention and treatment of GBS infections. Thus, there remains a need to explore vaccines strategies capable of eliciting protective immunity against a wide range of GBS stains.
      Accordingly, it is a primary objective of the present invention to provide a vaccine capable of eliciting protective immunity against GBS infections.
      It is a further objective of the present invention to provide a vaccine that elicits protective immunity against many clinically important GBS strains.
      Another objective of the present invention is to provide a vaccine composed of a single fusion protein that elicits protective immunity against GBS infections. The single protein has several advantages over a vaccine composed of multiple proteins, e.g. cost of production and safety.
      The means of accomplishing each of the above objectives as well as others will become apparent from the description of the invention which follows hereafter.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      It has surprisingly been found that a fusion protein comprising two different non-immunodominant regions, such as the N-terminal region fragment from GBS Rib protein fused to the N-terminal region fragment from GBS alpha protein, i.e, a fusion between non-immunodominant regions in two different proteins expressed by two different strains of GBS, will give rise to a fusion protein which gives rise to a very efficient protection against infections with the two different bacterial strains, when the fusion protein is administrated to a mammal as a vaccine. This protection is conferred by antibodies.
      In a first aspect the invention relates to a fusion protein comprising at least one first N-terminal region fragment of a group B Streptococcus surface protein or analogue, homologue, derivative or immunologically related amino acid sequence or fragments thereof, which is fused to at least one second N-terminal region fragment of a group B Streptococcus surface protein or analogue, homologue, derivative or immunologically related amino acid sequence or fragments thereof, wherein said first and second at least one N-terminal region fragments of group B Streptococcus surface proteins derive from different group B Streptococcus strains, and wherein said fusion protein is capable of eliciting protective immunity against group B Streptococcus.
      A major advantage of the fusion protein of the invention is that it includes regions from the related surface proteins Rib and alpha, either of which is expressed by many clinically important strains of group B Streptococcus, and most importantly, it has been shown to elicit protective immunity against these clinically important strains.
      The fusion protein has the advantage that it is immunogenic even without adjuvant, eliciting protective immunity against Rib- and alpha-expressing strains. Moreover, the fusion protein vaccine of the invention can be administered with alum, an adjuvant accepted for use in humans. In contrast, the recently described “universal vaccine” was only reported to work together with Freund's adjuvant, a strongly irritating component that cannot be used in human medicine (Maione, D. et al, Science 2005. 309:148-150).
      Another advantage with the present invention is that a vaccine composition according to the invention can be composed of a single fusion protein and still elicit protective immunity against different GBS infections. This has several advantages over a vaccine composed of multiple proteins, e.g. a single protein is simpler, safer and cheaper to manufacture than a mixture containing multiple proteins.
      More specifically, the present invention relates to said fusion protein; an isolated nucleotide sequence; a vector; a host cell; a vaccine; and a method for preventing or treating a group B Streptococcus infection.
      The present invention will be described in more detail below, inter alia, with reference to the drawings.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002689326,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) are complex and heterogeneous multicopy families of genetic elements which are remnants of ancestral retroviral infections having entered the genome of certain species through insertions within germline cells. Altogether HERV elements represent about 8% of the human genome and, when HERV elements have retained transcriptional activity they rarely cause complete retroviral genome expression and this is barely expected to arise from completely functional proviral copies.
      Multiple Sclerosis associated Retrovirus element (MSRV), which is a member of type-W human endogenous retrovirus family (HERV-W), was first isolated from cells of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. MSRV is normally latent in the genome of individuals, but when triggered by co-factors, such as certain common viruses, it can be reactivated and it can further express an envelope protein of the HERV-W family. The inventors previously investigated this mechanism and unveiled that it is a major triggering and aggravating factor in the development and progression of various diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP), unipolar or psychotic depression, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS, with neurological symptom), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), epilepsy, psoriasis, cancer, inflammatory pancreatitis and diabetes such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
      Despite possible expression of all structural retroviral genes from HERVs, i.e. of gag gene encoding matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid precursor polyprotein, together with pol gene encoding retroviral enzymes including protease, reverse-transcriptase and integrase precursor polyprotein, and together with env gene encoding the envelope precursor protein from the same HERV, no infectious retroviral copy from HERVs could be found to date.
      Moreover, contrary to exogenous infectious retroviruses, HERVs are present in the DNA of all cells from each human individual and, therefore, therapeutic molecules classically used for treating human retroviruses cannot eliminate the corresponding provirus within a sub-population of reservoir cells. Many cellular and genetic constraints on these endogenous elements also make them controlled by non-retroviral molecular mechanisms, thus escaping from classical retroviral pathways. Among these various mechanisms, an involvement of gene silencing, of gene control by cellular promoter/enhancer or of genetic recombination between HERV sequences and cellular genes are known. Such features are not expected with classical exogenous retroviruses and therefore are not accessible to presently existing anti-retroviral therapy.
      In such conditions, treatments of classical exogenous retroviruses cannot expect to fully control pathogenic HERV expression and, consequently, to have optimal therapeutic efficiency, if any, on HERV-associated diseases.
      There is thus a long time felt unfulfilled need for a novel antiretroviral therapeutic strategy targeting the HERV viruses.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The inventors have surprisingly found out that an unexpected anti-HERV effect targeting endogenous elements from the HERV-W family can reduce and inhibit HERV-W expression. Therefore, in a first aspect, the invention relates to an antibody, a fragment or a derivative thereof for use as an antiretroviral drug targeting a virus belonging to a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), wherein said antibody is directed against HERV-W Envelope protein (HERV-W Env). Preferably, said antibody, fragment or derivative is for preventing and/or treating an HERV-W associated disease. More preferably, said antibody is for preventing and/or treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP). More preferably, said antibody is a monoclonal humanized antibody, wherein the heavy chain (HC) has the amino acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID No: 9 and the light chain (LC) has the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID No: 10.
      In a second aspect, the invention relates to a composition comprising, preferably consisting of, an antibody directed against HERV-W Envelope protein (HERV-W Env), a fragment or a derivative thereof and a retroviral reverse-transcriptase inhibitory drug for use as an antiretroviral drug targeting a virus belonging to human endogenous retroviruses (HERV).
      In a third aspect, the invention relates to an antibody directed against HERV-W Envelope protein (HERV-W Env), a fragment or a derivative thereof and a retroviral reverse-transcriptase inhibitory drug as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in a method for treating an HERV-W associated disease, preferably a disease selected from the group consisting of multiple sclerosis (MS), schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP), unipolar or psychotic depression, clinically isolated syndrome (CIS, with neurological symptom), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), epilepsy, psoriasis, cancer, inflammatory pancreatitis and diabetes such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes.
      In a fourth aspect, the invention relates to a kit comprising at least one oligonucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID No: 11 to 28.
      In a fifth aspect, the invention relates to an antibody directed against HERV-W Envelope protein (HERV-W Env), a fragment or a derivative thereof for use as an antiretroviral drug targeting a virus belonging to human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), preferably to the HERV-W family, more preferably to MSRV, in a patient suffering from an HERV-W associated disease, wherein said patient is identified by a method comprising a step i) of detecting and/or quantifying HERV-W in a biological sample.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002457214,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Within the biotechnology industry, the purification of proteins on a commercial scale is an important challenge to the development of recombinant proteins for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Problems related to yield, purity, and throughput plague the manufacturing sector. With the advent of recombinant protein technology, a protein of interest can be produced using cultured eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cell lines engineered to express a gene encoding the protein. What results from the host cell culturing process, however, is a mixture of the desired protein along with impurities that are either derived from the protein itself, such as protein variants, or from the host cell, such as host cell proteins. The use of the desired recombinant protein for pharmaceutical applications is contingent on being able to reliably recover adequate levels of the protein from these impurities.
       Conventional protein purification methods are designed to separate the protein of interest from impurities based on differences in size, charge, solubility, and degree of hydrophobicity. Such methods include chromatographic methods such as affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. These methods often employ a separation medium that can be designed to selectively adhere either the protein of interest or the impurities. In the bind-elute mode, the desired protein selectively binds to the separation medium and is differentially eluted from the medium by different solvents. In the flow-through mode, the impurities specifically bind to the separation medium while the protein of interest does not, thus allowing the recovery of the desired protein in the “flow-through.”
       Current methods for the purification of proteins, such as antibodies, include two or more chromatographic steps. For example, the first step in the protein purification protocol often involves an affinity chromatography step that utilizes a specific interaction between the protein of interest and an immobilized capture reagent. Protein A adsorbents are particularly useful for affinity capture of proteins, such as antibodies, which contain an Fc region. However, drawbacks to using Protein A chromatography for protein purification include leakage of the Protein A capture agent, leading to contamination of the eluted protein product. Additionally, affinity capture does not separate protein variants, such as aggregated forms of the protein, from the protein of interest.
       Researchers have used bind-elute methods, flow-through methods, and displacement methods in efforts to recover proteins free from impurities resulting from both the culturing process and from possible prior steps in the purification process itself. Examples of groups using a bind-elute step as a typical second step to purifying proteins after an affinity capture step include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,983,722, describing a bind-elute ion exchange method of reducing Protein A from a mixture; U.S. Pat. No. 5,429,746, describing a bind-elute hydrophobic interaction chromatography method for purifying IgG antibody from a mixture including Protein A impurities; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,644,036, describing a three-step process for obtaining a purified IgG antibody preparation comprising a Protein A step, a bind-elute ion exchange step, and a size exclusion step. Other groups have used a flow-through step after the affinity chromatography step. For example, PCT publication WO 04/076485 describes a method for removing leaked Protein A from an antibody purified by a Protein A chromatography step followed by a flow-through ion exchange step. PCT publication WO 03/059935 describes a method for purifying a protein in a sample comprising subjecting the sample to a flow-through hydroxyapatite chromatography step following an affinity chromatography step.
       Other groups have used a single polishing-step purification scheme to avoid the problems associated with prior purification steps. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 6,177,548 describes a single-step flow-through ion exchange method for removing aggregates from a biological sample where the pH of the sample is adjusted to 0.2 logs below the isoelectric point of the biological sample. U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,662 describes a single-step bind-elute ion exchange method where the pH of the crude protein mixture is adjusted to a point between the ranges of isoelectric points of the protein fractions to be separated. PCT publication WO 05/044856 describes a single-step displacement method for removal of high molecular weight aggregates from antibody preparations using hydroxyapatite chromatography.
       None of the conventional bind-elute or flow-through methods in the prior art, however, is able to meet the needs of the biotechnology industry in terms of all the requirements of throughput, yield, and product purity. Bind-elute methods and displacement methods are limited by, among other factors, the capacity limit of the separation medium for the desired protein. Flow-through methods, on the other hand, do allow for higher load challenges than bind-elute methods but are limited by the capacity of the separation medium for the impurities. With flow-through methods, no substantial binding of the product to the column occurs; any substantial product binding is seen as negatively impacting product recovery. There is still a need for methods of recovering purified proteins at high throughput that meet the requirements for purity and yield necessary for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. In addition, commercial manufacturing processes add the needs for reliable, robust, and cost-effective purification schemes.

Field of the Invention
      The present disclosure provides BET bromodomain protein degraders and therapeutic methods of treating conditions and diseases wherein degradation of one or more BET bromodomains provides a benefit
Background
      The genomes of eukaryotic organisms are highly organized within the nucleus of the cell. The long strands of duplex DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins (usually comprising two copies of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) to form a nucleosome, which then is further compressed to form a highly condensed chromatin structure. A range of different condensation states are possible, and the tightness of this structure varies during the cell cycle. The chromatin structure plays a critical role in regulating gene transcription, which cannot occur efficiently from highly condensed chromatin. The chromatin structure is controlled by a series of post translational modifications to histone proteins, notably histones H3 and H4. These modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and SUMOylation.
      Histone acetylation usually is associated with the activation of gene transcription, as the modification loosens the interaction of the DNA and the histone octamer by changing the electrostatics. In addition to this physical change, specific proteins bind to acetylated lysine residues within histones to read the epigenetic code. Bromodomains are small (about 110 amino acid) distinct domains within proteins that bind to acetylated lysine resides commonly, but not exclusively, in the context of histones. There is a family of about 50 proteins known to contain bromodomains, which have a range of functions within the cell.
      The BET family of bromodomain-containing proteins (“BET bromodomains” or “BET bromodomain proteins”) includes four proteins, i.e., BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRD-t, which contain tandem bromodomains capable of binding to two acetylated lysine residues in close proximity, thereby increasing the specificity of the interaction. BRD2 and BRD3 associate with histones along actively transcribed genes and may be involved in facilitating transcriptional elongation, while BRD4 may be involved in the recruitment of the pTEF-β complex to inducible genes, resulting in phosphorylation of RNA polymerase and increased transcriptional output. BRD4 or BRD3 also may fuse with NUT (nuclear protein in testis) forming novel fusion oncogenes, BRD4-NUT or BRD3-NUT, in a highly malignant form of epithelial neoplasia. Data suggests that BRD-NUT fusion proteins contribute to carcinogenesis. BRD-t is uniquely expressed in the testes and ovary. All family members have been reported to have some function in controlling or executing aspects of the cell cycle, and have been shown to remain in complex with chromosomes during cell division, which suggests a role in the maintenance of epigenetic memory. In addition, some viruses make use of these proteins to tether their genomes to the host cell chromatin as part of the process of viral replication.
      A discussion of BET proteins can be found in WO 2012/075456, WO 2012/075383, and WO 2011/054864. A discussion of BET bromodomain inhibitors, e.g., I-BET-151 and I-BET-762, can be found in Delmore et al., Cell 146:904-917 (2011) and Seal et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 22:2968-2972 (2012).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002449996,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is important for normal embryological/ananatomical development, host defense and suppression of oncogenesis. Faulty regulation of apoptosis has been implicated in cancer and many other human diseases which result from an imbalance between the process of cell division and cell death. Bcl-2 was originally identified at the chromosomal breakpoint of t(14;18)-bearing B-cell lymphomas and belongs to a growing family of proteins which regulate apoptosis. (Gross, A; McDonnell, J M; Korsmeyer, S. J. BCL-2 family members and the mitochondria in apoptosis. Genes & Development 1999, 13, 1899-1911, Cory, S.; Huang, D. C. S.; Adams, J. M. The Bcl-2 family: roles in cell survival and oncogenesis. Oncogene, 2003 22, 8590-8607. Danial, N. N.; Korsmeyer, S. J. Cell death: Critical control points. Cell 2004, 116, 205-218. Chao, D. T.; Korsmeyer, S. J. Bcl-2 family: regulators of cell death. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998, 16, 395-419). Apoptosis, Christopher Potten, James Wilson, Cambridge University Press, 2004). The Bcl-2 family of proteins include both anti-apoptotic molecules, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and pro-apoptotic molecules, such as Bax, Bak, Bid and Bad. Bcl-2 contributes to cancer cell progression by preventing normal cell turnover caused by physiological cell-death mechanisms. Over-expression of Bcl-2 has been observed in 70% of breast cancer and many other forms of cancer (Buolaniwini, J. K. Novel anticancer drug discovery. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999, 3, 500-509). The expression levels of Bcl-2 proteins also correlate with resistance to a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs and γ-radiation therapy (Reed, J. C.; Miyashita, T.; Takayama, S.; Wang, H.-G.; Sato, T.; Krajewski, S.; Aime-Sempe, C.; Bodrug, S.; Kitada, S.; Hanada, M. Bcl-2 family proteins: Regulators of cell-death involved in the pathogenesis of cancer and resistance to therapy. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996, 60, 23-32; Reed, J. C. Bcl-2 family proteins: strategies for overcoming chemoresistance in cancer. Advances in Pharmocology 1997, 41, 501-553; Strasser, A.; Huang, D. C. S.; Vaux, D. L. The role of the Bcl-2/ced-9 gene family in cancer and general implications of defects in cell death control for tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy. Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1997,1333, F151-F189; DiPaola, R. S.; Aisner, J. Overcoming Bcl-2- and p53-mediated resistance in prostate cancer. Semin. Oncol. 1999, 26, 112-116).
       Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins represent key regulators of apoptosis, with pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax, Bak, Bid, Bim, Noxa, Puma) and anti-apoptotic function (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1). Selective and competitive dimerization between pro-and anti-apoptotic members of the family determines the fate of a cell given pro-apoptotic stimulus. Although the precise roles of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in cancer are not completely understood, there are several lines of evidence that suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL not only contribute to cancer progression by preventing normal cell turnover, but also play a role in the resistance of cancer cells to current cancer treatments. Experimental over-expression of Bcl-2 (Bcl-xL) renders cancer cells resistant to a wide spectrum of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation (Bcl-2 family proteins: Regulators of cell-death involved in the pathogenesis of cancer and resistance to therapy. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996, 60, 23-32; Reed, J. C). Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL are over-expressed in more than 50% of all tumors as shown below (from Wang, S.; Yang, D.; Lippman, M. E. Targeting Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with nonpeptidic small-molecule antagonists. Seminars in Oncology, 2003, 5, 133-142).
           Biological approaches to modulating Bcl-2 function using anti-sense oligonucleotides or single-chain antibodies have been shown to enhance tumor cell chemosensitivity (Ziegler, A.; Luedke, G. H.; Fabbro, D.; Altmann, K. H.; Stahel, R. A.; Zangemeister-Wittke, U. Induction of apoptosis in small-cell lung cancer cells by an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting the Bcl-2 coding sequence. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 1997, 89, 1027-1036; Webb, A.; Cunningham, D.; Cotter, F.; Clarke, P. A.; Di Stefano, F.; Ross, P.; Corpo, M.; Dziewanowska, Z. Bcl-2 antisense therapy in patients with non-hodgkin lymphoma. Lancet 1997, 349, 1137-1141; Cotter, F. E. Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide therapy in patients with non-hodgkin's lymphoma. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000, 18, 1812-1823; Piche, A.; Grim, J.; Rancourt, C.; Gomez-Navarro, J.; Reed, J. C.; Curiel, D. T. Modulation of Bcl-2 protein levels by an intracellular anti-Bcl-2 single-chain antibody increases drug-induced cytotoxicity in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Cancer Res. 1998, 58, 2134-2140).
       It has been shown that an anti-sense oligonucleotide (G3139) (Raynaud, F. I.; Orr, R. M.; Goddard, P. M.; Lacey, H. A.; Lancashire, H.; Judson, I. R.; Beck, T.; Bryan, B.; Cotter, F. E. Pharmacokinetics of G3139, a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to Bcl-2, after intravenous administration or continuous subcutaneous infusion to mice. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997, 281, 420-427), designed to hybridize to sequence in Bcl-2 mRNA, inhibits Bcl-2 expression, induces apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in human breast cancer cells having Bcl-2 over-expression (Chen, H. X., Marchall, J. L., Trocky, N., Baidas, S., Rizvi, N., Ling, Y., Bhagava, P., Lippman, M. E., Yang, D., and Hayes, D. F. A Phase I study of Bcl-2 antisense G3139 (Genta) and weekly docetaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer and other solid tumors. Proceedings of American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2000). Importantly, synergistic effects and complete tumor regression were observed in vivo in the combined treatments of G3139 with docetaxel. Therefore, Bcl-2 represents a highly attractive target for the development of a novel therapy for the treatment of many forms of cancers.
       Limitations associated with the use of large molecules, such as oligonucleotides, proteins and polypeptides, as therapeutic agents include poor oral availability, poor in vivo stability, and high cost. More desirable therapeutics would be non-peptide, cell-permeable small molecules that bind to Bcl-2 and block the anti-apoptotic function in cancer and promote cell-death in tumors.
       Various small molecules have been shown to inhibit the function of Bcl-2. For example, acyl sulfonamides were shown to inhibit the function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in biochemical and in vitro assays. Nature (2005) 435, 677-681. Nevertheless, the need exists for additional small organic molecules that bind to Bcl-2 and block its anti-apoptotic function in cancer and promote cell death in tumors. The present invention fulfills this need and has other related advantages.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002573914,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Engineered proteins, such as bi- or multispecific antibodies capable of binding two or more antigens, are known in the art. Such multispecific binding proteins can be generated using cell fusion, chemical conjugation, or recombinant DNA techniques.
      A wide variety of recombinant multispecific antibody formats have been developed in the recent past, e.g. tetravalent bispecific antibodies by fusion of, e.g. an IgG antibody format and single chain domains (see e.g. Coloma, M. J., et. al., Nature Biotech. 15 (1997) 159-163; WO 2001/077342; and Morrison, S. L., Nature Biotech. 25 (2007) 1233-1234.
      Also several other new formats wherein the antibody core structure (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM) is no longer retained such as dia-, tria- or tetrabodies, minibodies, several single chain formats (scFv, Bis-scFv), which are capable of binding two or more antigens, have been developed (Holliger, P., et. al., Nature Biotech 23 (2005) 1126-1136; Fischer, N., and Léger, O., Pathobiology 74 (2007) 3-14; Shen, J., et. al., J. Immunol. Methods 318 (2007) 65-74; Wu, C., et al., Nature Biotech 25 (2007) 1290-1297).
      All such formats use linkers either to fuse the antibody core (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM) to a further binding protein (e.g. scFv) or to fuse e.g. two Fab fragments or scFv (Fischer, N., and Léger, O., Pathobiology 74 (2007) 3-14). While it is obvious that linkers have advantages for the engineering of bispecific antibodies, they may also cause problems in therapeutic settings. Indeed, these foreign peptides might elicit an immune response against the linker itself or the junction between the protein and the linker. Further more, the flexible nature of these peptides makes them more prone to proteolytic cleavage, potentially leading to poor antibody stability, aggregation and increased immunogenicity. In addition one may want to retain effector functions, such as e.g. complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which are mediated through the Fc part by maintaining a high degree of similarity to naturally occurring antibodies.
      Thus ideally, one should aim at developing bispecific antibodies that are very similar in general structure to naturally occurring antibodies (like IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG or IgM) with minimal deviation from human sequences.
      In one approach bispecific antibodies that are very similar to natural antibodies have been produced using the quadroma technology (see Milstein, C. and Cuello, A. C., Nature 305 (1983) 537-540) based on the somatic fusion of two different hybridoma cell lines expressing murine monoclonal antibodies with the desired specificities of the bispecific antibody. Because of the random pairing of two different antibody heavy and light chains within the resulting hybrid-hybridoma (or quadroma) cell line, up to ten different antibody species are generated of which only one is the desired, functional bispecific antibody. Due to the presence of mispaired byproducts, and significantly reduced production yields, means sophisticated purification procedures are required (see e.g. Morrison, S. L., Nature Biotech. 25 (2007) 1233-1234). In general the same problem of mispaired byproducts remains if recombinant expression techniques are used.
      An approach to circumvent the problem of mispaired byproducts, which is known as ‘knobs-into-holes’, aims at forcing the pairing of two different antibody heavy chains by introducing mutations into the CH3 domains to modify the contact interface. On one chain bulky amino acids were replaced by amino acids with short side chains to create a ‘hole’. Conversely, amino acids with large side chains were introduced into the other CH3 domain, to create a ‘knob’. By coexpressing these two heavy chains (and two identical light chains, which have to be appropriate for both heavy chains), high yields of heterodimer formation (‘knob-hole’) versus homodimer formation (‘hole-hole’ or ‘knob-knob’) was observed (Ridgway, J. B., Protein Eng. 9 (1996) 617-621; and WO 96/027011). The percentage of heterodimer could be further increased by remodeling the interaction surfaces of the two CH3 domains using a phage display approach and the introduction of a disulfide bridge to stabilize the heterodimers (Merchant A. M, et al., Nature Biotech 16 (1998) 677-681; Atwell, S., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 270 (1997) 26-35). New approaches for the knobs-into-holes technology are described in e.g. in EP 1870459A1. Although this format appears very attractive, no data describing progression towards the clinic are currently available. One important constraint of this strategy is that the light chains of the two parent antibodies have to be identical to prevent mispairing and formation of inactive molecules. Thus this technique is not appropriate for easily developing recombinant, bispecific antibodies against two antigens starting from two antibodies against the first and the second antigen, as either the heavy chains of these antibodies an/or the identical light chains have to be optimized.
      Another approach to circumvent the problem of mispaired byproducts in the preparation of bispecific antibodies, is to switch from heterodimers to homodimers by using an full length antibody which specifically binds to a first antigen and which has fused to its heavy chains N-termini two fused Fab fragments which specifically bind to a second antigen as described e.g. in WO2001/077342. One important disadvantage of this strategy is the formation of undesired inactive byproducts by the mispairing of the light chains of the full length antibody with the CH1-VH domains of the Fab fragments and by the mispairing of the Fab fragment light chains with CH1-VH domains of the full length antibody.
      WO 2006/093794 relates to heterodimeric protein binding compositions. WO 99/37791 describes multipurpose antibody derivatives. Morrison, S., L., et al the J. Immunolog, 160 (1998) 2802-2808 refers to the influence of variable region domain exchange on the functional properties of IgG.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002631321,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      In recent years, cancer mortality in our country has clearly been on the rise. People's lives and the quality of life are seriously threatened by cancer. Thus, it is a challenging and significant subject to search for new anticancer drugs with high efficacy and low toxicity in the life sciences nowadays. Receptor tyrosine kinase is a kind of transmembrane protein involved in signal transduction. It has been shown that over 50% of the proto-oncogene and oncogene products have tyrosine kinase activity, and their abnormal expression causes tumorigenesis. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been approved to be on the market since 2001, which have become a new class of anticancer drugs with good performance.
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. The epidermal growth factor receptor pathway plays a very important role in tumorigenesis and progression, which has become the main research subject and one of the developing targets in the field of cancer therapy. Such drugs which have been on the market now include erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib (Tykerb, GW572016), as well as neratinib, which is currently in the clinical phase. PCT Patent Application Publication WO2011029265 discloses a method for the preparation of the compound (R, E)-N-(4-(3-chloro-4-(pyridin-2-ylmethoxy)phenylamino)-3-cyano-7-ethoxyquino line-6-yl)-3-(1-methylpyrrolidino-2-yl)acrylamide (referred to as “SHR1258” below for convenience). This drug molecule has distinct advantages of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Although PCT Patent Application Publication WO2011029265 discloses the chemical structure and preparation method of compound SHR1258, it is silent to the condition of its salification. In Chinese Patent Application No. 201110062359.8, the dimaleate of this compound (referred to as “SHR1258 dimaleate” below) has been described, and its structure is as follows:
      
(MOL) (CDX)
      However, the inventors did not do further research on the polymorphs and preparation method of SHR1258 dimaleate. As known to the person skilled in the art, the polymorph structure of the pharmaceutically active ingredient always affects the chemical stability of the drug. Different storage conditions and crystallization conditions may lead to a change in the polymorph structure of the compound, which is sometimes accompanied by other forms of polymorph. In general, an amorphous drug product does not have a regular crystal structure, and often has other defects such as poor product stability, smaller particle size, hard filtration, agglomerates easily, and poor solubility. Thus, it is necessary to improve all aspects of the nature of the above product. There is a need to search for a new polymorph which has higher polymorph purity and better chemical stability.

      The inventor has tested a series of crystallization products of SHR1258 dimaleate obtained under various conditions by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests. The results show that a stable crystal form of SHR1258 dimaleate, which is referred to as form I crystal, can be obtained under normal crystallization conditions. DSC patterns of the present form I crystal of SHR1258 dimaleate show a distinct melting absorption peak at 130° C. The X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in FIG. 1, which used Cu-Kα radiation to obtain the X-ray diffraction patterns represented by 2θ angles and interplanar crystal spacing (d value) in which there are characteristic peaks at 6.28 (14.06), 6.74 (13.10), 10.60 (8.34), 11.58 (7.64), 13.50 (6.55), 14.90 (5.94), 15.80 (5.60), 18.26 (4.85), 20.66 (4.30), 21.14 (4.20), 22.96 (3.87), 24.34 (3.65), 25.54 (3.49), and 26.12 (3.41).
      In the method for the preparation of the form I crystal of the present invention, there is no special limitation for the existing form of SHR1258 dimaleate as starting material, and it can be used in any crystal form or amorphous form. A method for the preparation of form I crystal of SHR1258 dimaleate of the present invention comprises the following steps:
      When using an organic solvent with a small number of carbon atoms as a crystallization solvent, a polar organic solvent with a small number of carbon atoms and higher volatility is preferred, such as alcohols, ketones, esters, or a mixture thereof; and isopropyl alcohol, acetone, ethanol, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or a mixture thereof is more preferred for the recrystallization of SHR1258 dimaleate. The solvent for crystallization can be a single solvent or a mixture of solvents comprising the solvents mentioned above.
      Specifically, the process for the preparation of form I crystal of SHR1258 dimaleate comprises the following steps:
(1) A mixture of SHR1258 and maleic acid or the SHR1258 dimaleate solid is dissolved in a sufficient quantity of organic solvents, and the solution obtained is cooled to cause crystallization.
(2) The crystals are filtered, washed, and dried.
(1) A mixture of SHR1258 and maleic acid or the SHR1258 dimaleate solid is dissolved in a sufficient quantity of organic solvents, and the solution obtained is cooled to cause crystallization.
(2) The crystals are filtered, washed, and dried.
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the organic solvent in step 1 is selected from one or more solvents of alcohols with no more than three carbons, acetone, ethyl esters, and tetrahydrofuran, preferably ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and tetrahydrofuran.
      Furthermore, the most preferred single solvent is isopropyl alcohol.
      In another embodiment of the present invention, the preferred mixture of solvents is a mixture of ethanol and tetrahydrofuran. The ratio of the two is not limited, while the volume ratio of 1:1 is preferred in an embodiment of the present invention.
      The recrystallization method is not limited and can be performed with conventional recrystallization processes used in the art. For example, SHR1258 dimaleate can be heated to dissolve in organic solvent, and then the solution is cooled gradually and let stand to crystallize, or the solution is stirred to crystallize. After crystallization, the resulting precipitate is collected by filtration and then dried. In particular, a full conversion process is necessary for the formation of the stable crystal form, and an amorphous structure or crystals with lower purity will form easily when the crystallization process is too fast, which is usually caused by a supersatured solution. An increase in solvent volume or a decrease in crystallization rate will be helpful for the formation of a stable crystal form with high purity. The crystals obtained by filtration are usually dried under vacuum at about 30° C. to 100° C., preferably 40° C. to 60° C., to remove the recrystallization solvent.
      The resulting crystal form of SHR1258 dimaleate was determined by DSC and X-ray diffraction patterns. Meanwhile, the residual solvent was also determined.
      The crystal of SHR1258 dimaleate prepared according to the present method has no or very little residual solvent, which meets the requirement of the national pharmacopoeia for the residual solvent of drug products. Thus, the crystal of the present invention can be properly used as a pharmaceutical active ingredient.
      The research results show that the stability of the form I crystal of SHR1258 dimaleate obtained in the present invention is significantly better than the amorphous form under the conditions of high temperature and high humidity. Moreover, the form I crystal has good stability under the conditions of grinding, pressure and heating, which can meet the production, transportation, and storage requirements of medicaments. The preparation process is stable and repeatable, which is especially suitable for industrial production.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200970230,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Bones sometimes develop at different rates, leaving some bones disproportionately shorter than other bones. Alternatively, injury may leave a bone shorter than its original length. Such a condition may lead to difficulties in a patient's movement. For instance, a small jaw may cause difficulties in chewing or breathing (e.g., obstructive sleep apnea). Moreover, deformations are often psychologically distressing to the patient, especially when the deformations occur in craniofacial bones.
      One procedure for lengthening bones is referred to as osteodistraction. According to an osteodistraction procedure, an abnormally short bone is cut into two segments. The two segments are secured to a brace that permits the segments to be drawn apart. New bone then grows in the space between the separated bone segments, and eventually couples the two segments together into a lengthened bone. In certain osteodistraction procedures, support fixtures such as Kirschner wires (“K-wires”) or pins may be implanted into the bone segments to be distracted. After implantation of the fixtures into the bone, the brace may be secured to the fixtures using one or more clamps. Traditional braces may include clamps that are rigidly coupled to the brace. As the bone segments undergo distraction, the angles of the fixtures may change relative to the brace. Rigid coupling of the clamps to the brace may lead to buckling or binding of the brace components.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      In particular embodiments, the present disclosure provides for a mandibular distraction system which includes a rod and a first pin clamp assembly coupled adjacent a first end of the rod. In the system, the first pin clamp assembly includes a first clamp. The system further includes a second pin clamp assembly which includes an advancement mechanism that moveably couples the second pin clamp assembly to the rod. In the system, the second pin clamp assembly includes a second clamp. A swivel joint is disposed between the advancement mechanism and the second clamp whereby the second clamp is enabled to rotate relative to the advancement mechanism.
      In particular embodiments, the mandibular distraction system may further include a dampening mechanism which serves to dampen the rotational movement of the advancement mechanism relative to the second clamp.
      Technical advantages of particular embodiments of the present disclosure may include a swivel joint whereby a clamp may be rotationally coupled to a distraction rod such that the clamp may rotate in a single plane relative to the rod. The rotational coupling disposed between the clamp and the distraction rod may eliminate or redistribute unwanted forces caused by the distraction process. Additionally, the rotational interplay between the distraction rod and the clamp may provide for a distraction system that can compensate for changes in the positions of certain bone fixtures relative to the rod while still allowing distractive forces to be applied. Further technical advantages of the present disclosure include a circular loop of frictional material positioned in the swivel joint whereby the degree of rotational movement of the clamp relative to the distraction rod may be controlled.
      Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures, descriptions, and claims. Moreover, while specific advantages have been enumerated above, various embodiments may include all, some, or none of the enumerated advantages.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002603742,"BACKGROUND ART
      Cancer is the leading cause of death. Currently conducted therapy comprises mainly surgical therapy in combination with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In spite of the development of new operative procedures and the discovery of new anticancer agents in recent years, cancer treatment results have not been much improved recently, excluding that for some types of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biology or cancer immunology lead to identification of antibodies specifically reacting with cancer, cancer antigens to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells, genes encoding cancer antigens, and the like. Demands on specific cancer therapies targeting cancer antigens are increasing (Non-patent Literature 1).
      In cancer therapy, it is desirable that peptides, polypeptides, or proteins recognized as antigens be almost absent in normal cells, but they be present specifically in cancer cells, in order to alleviate side effects. In 1991, Boon et al., (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Belgium) isolated a human melanoma antigen MAGE1 recognized by CD8-positive T cells by the cDNA expression cloning method using autologous cancer cell lines and cancer-reactive T cells (Non-patent Literature 2). Thereafter, the SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) method that comprises identifying tumor antigens recognized by antibodies that are produced in vivo in response to autologous cancer of a cancer patient by gene expression cloning techniques was reported (Non-patent Literature 3 and Patent Literature 1). With the use of this method, some cancer antigens, which are almost never expressed in normal cells but are specifically expressed in cancer cells, were isolated (Non-patent Literatures 4-9). Furthermore, clinical trials were conducted with cell therapies targeting some cancer antigens using immunocytes specifically reactive with cancer antigens, or cancer-specific immunotherapies using vaccines or the like containing cancer antigens.
      Meanwhile, in recent years, various antibody medicines which target antigenic proteins on cancer cells for cancer treatment have appeared throughout the world. Antibody medicines exhibit some pharmacological effects as cancer specific therapeutic agents and are thus attracting attention. However, most antigen proteins to be targeted are also expressed in normal cells, so that not only cancer cells, but also normal cells expressing antigens are also damaged as a result of antibody administration. The resulting side effects cause for concern. Therefore, it is expected that identification of cancer antigens that are specifically expressed on the surface of a cancer cell and use of antibodies targeting the cancer antigens as pharmaceuticals will realize treatment with antibody medicines with lower side effects.
      Cytoplasmic- and proliferation-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN-1) is expressed when normal cells at the resting phase are activated or undergo cell division, and it is an intracellular protein known to form intracellular stress granules with RNA within cells, so as to be involved in mRNA transport and translational regulation. Meanwhile, many other names that represent CAPRIN-1 exist, such as GPI-anchored membrane protein 1 or membrane component surface marker 1 protein (M11S1), as if such proteins had been known to be cell membrane proteins. These names originated from a report that the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 is a membrane protein having a GPI-binding region and expressed in colorectal cancer cells (Non-patent Literature 10). However, the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 provided in this report was later revealed to be wrong. The following has recently been reported; i.e., deletion of a single nucleotide in the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like causes a frame shift, so that 80 amino acids are lost from the C-terminus, resulting in generation of an artifact (74 amino acids) which corresponds to the GPI-binding portion in the previous report, and additionally, another error is also present 5′ of the gene sequence, so that 53 amino acids were lost from the N-terminus (Non-patent Literature 11). It has been also recently reported that the protein encoded by the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like is not a cell membrane protein (Non-patent Literature 11).
      In addition, on the basis of the report of Non-patent Literature 10 that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein, Patent Literatures 2 and 3 describe that CAPRIN-1 (as a cell membrane protein) under the name of M11S1 can be used as a target of an antibody medicine in cancer therapy, although working examples do not describe treatment using an antibody against the protein. However, as reported in Non-patent Literature 11, it has been commonly believed from the time of the filing of Patent Literature 2 to date that CAPRIN-1 is not expressed on the surface of a cell. The contents of Patent Literatures 2 and 3 based only on incorrect information that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein should not clearly be understood as common general knowledge for persons skilled in the art.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002674894,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Bioluminescence refers to the ability of biological organisms or biomolecules to produce and emit light. Ability to produce bioluminescence is determined by the presence of a specific protein: a luciferase or a photoprotein. Luciferases are enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of low molecular weight compounds, i. e. luciferins, and convert them into oxyluciferins. The oxidation is accompanied by the emission of light and release of oxyluciferin.
      Photoproteins also catalyze the oxidation of luciferin; however, in this case, luciferin acts as a prosthetic group to form a stable photoprotein complex. The quantity of light produced by a photoprotein is approximately proportional to a concentration thereof, while for luciferase it depends on concentrations of both the enzyme and luciferin. In many cases, bioluminescent reaction catalyzed by a photoprotein is activated in response to release of metal ions in the medium. For example, aequorin photoprotein catalyzes the oxidation of luciferin (coelenterazine) in response to release of calcium ions, which results in emitting short flashes of light.
      Luciferases are used as reporter genes in many applications of biomedicine and biotechnology. In particular, they are used in diagnostic methods, methods for detecting microorganisms and toxic agents in a medium; they are also used for determining concentrations of various substances, for detecting activation of signalling cascades, etc. [Scott et al., Annu Rev Anal Chem, 2011, 4: 297-319; Badr and Tannous, Trends Biotechnol. 2011, 29: 624-33; Andreu et al., FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2011, 35: 360-94]. Many methods of the application of luciferases have been reviewed [Kaskova et al., Chem Soc Rev., 2016, 45: 6048-6077; Scott et al., Annu Rev Anal Chem, 2011, 4: 297-319; Widder and Falls, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics, 2014, 20: 232-241].
      Several types of bioluminescent systems are known nowadays. It has been shown that various organisms developed them independently in the course of evolution more than forty times [Herring, Journal of Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence, 1987, 1: 147-63; Haddock et al., Annual Review of Marine Science, 2010; 2: 443-93].
      Luciferase from Photinus pyralis (North American firefly) catalyzing the oxidation of D-luciferin has been described [de Wet et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1985, 82: 7870-3; de Wet et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1987, 7: 725-37]. Oxidation of D-luciferin is accompanied by the release of yellow-green light having an emission maximum at 560 nm. The same D-luciferin is oxidized by other insect luciferases: as of today, more than 30 enzymes from various insect species of Phengodidae, Elateridae and Lampyridae families, emitting light with emission maxima in the range of 536 to 630 nm have been cloned. Also, mutant forms of insect luciferases have been described and synthetic D-luciferin analogs have been produced making it possible to obtain luciferin-luciferase pairs having different properties [Thorne et al., Chem Biol., 2010, 17: 646-57. Despite a wide variety of analogs, D-luciferin remains the most common substrate for in vivo bioluminescence due to high quantum efficiency of the reaction (0.88+−0.25 [Seliger and McElroy, Arch Biochem Biophys, 1960, 88: 136-141]). A significant difficulty in using this system is a relatively large molecular weight of luciferase from Photinus pyralis (61 kDa). This fact makes it unsuitable for creating several chimeric proteins (for example, for investigation of viruses) because of low stability of the increased genome thereof [Tran et al., J Virol, 2013, 87: 13321-13329; Tran et al., Viruses, 2015, 7: 5319-5327]. Another difficulty is a need to obtain D-luciferin in enantiomerically pure form since an isomer thereof, L-luciferin, is a strong competitive inhibitor of the reaction [Lembert, Biochem J, 1996, 317: 273-277]. The fact that luciferase from Photinus pyralis is not secreted places additional limitations upon quantifying the in vivo bioluminescent signal.
      Also, a large group of luciferases and photoproteins catalyzing the oxidation of coelenterazine has been described. For example, coelenterazine-dependent bioluminescent systems in Renilla, Gaussia and Metridia longa have been described [O. Shimomura, Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd, Singapore, 2006, 470 p.] and are widely used. Mutant forms of coelenterazine-dependent luciferases and photoproteins and synthetic analogs of coelenterazine have also been obtained [Kaskova et al., Chem Soc Rev., 2016, 45: 6048-6077]. Despite the plurality of advantages of the coelenterazine system, i. e. the ability to be secreted, small size and a wide variety of available luciferases, the main limitations for application thereof are primarily related to the location of a bioluminescence emission maximum in the blue region; as a result, the blue light is mostly absorbed in vivo by the tissues of interest. Besides, bioluminescence substrate itself can emit light during non-enzymatic oxidation by ambient oxygen (presence of superoxide anions and peroxynitrite ions in tissues enhances the process) resulting in noise in the measured bioluminescent signal.
      Another example of a bioluminescent system related to marine bacteria has been described. This system is significantly different from other bioluminescent systems. Bacterial luciferin (myristic aldehyde) is oxidized during the reaction but is not a bioluminescence emitter [O. Shimomura, Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd, Singapore, 2006? 470 p.]. In addition to luciferin, the key components of the luminescent reaction are NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), and FMN-H 2 (flavin mononucleotide), the oxidized derivative of which acts as the true light source. Bioluminescent systems of marine bacteria are of limited use since they are applicable only for prokaryotic expression systems.
      Bioluminescent system of the ostracod Cypridina which is characterized by highly reactive luciferin and highly stable luciferase are also known. [Shimomura et al., Science, 1969, 164: 1299-300]. One of the main disadvantages of this bioluminescent system is extremely low stability of Cypridina luciferin on air, especially in the presence of impurities. The bioluminescence maximum of luciferin falls in the range of 448-463 nm (depending on the ionic strength of a solution). This fact makes this system unsuitable for in vivo application in unaltered form in deep tissues.
      Bioluminescent systems of dinoflagellates and euphausiids are also known. As of today, the genes coding three luciferases of this group have been cloned [O. Shimomura, Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods, World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd, Singapore, 2006]. A significant disadvantage of these systems is the lack of knowledge thereof: full luciferase sequences have not been identified yet, and the range of application of the system have not been determined. As of today, knowledge associated with the bioluminescence mechanism of dinoflagellates and euphausiids is fragmentary.
      Despite the plurality of bioluminescent systems used today, there is still a need for more luciferin-luciferase pairs possessing new properties. In particular, ATP- and NAD(P)H-independent luciferases capable of oxidizing water-soluble cell-permeant luciferins may be advantageous.
      In this respect, fungal luciferases are of great interest. Fungal bioluminescence is well-known. Moreover, it was referred to in Aristotle's tractates. However, the fungal bioluminescent systems remain poorly known. In 1959, Airth and McElroy showed that the fungal bioluminescent system comprises at least a heat-sensitive component, i. e. luciferase, and a heat-insensitive component, i. e. luciferin, and NAD(P)H [Airth and McElroy, Journal of Bacteriology, 1959, 77: 249-50]. In 2015, Purtov et al. detected fungal luciferin: it was a membrane-permeant molecule—3-hydroxyhispidin [Purtov et al., Angewandte Chemie, 2015, 54: 8124-28]. However, no fungal luciferases were cloned.

0002668831,"BACKGROUND
      Human Apolipoprotein A-I is the major protein component of (HDL), which is an important lipoprotein in blood. It is synthesized by the liver and intestine and is responsible for the physiological function of HDL in the blood; the removal of cholesterol from peripheral tissues, carrying it back either to the liver or to other lipoproteins, by a mechanism known as “reverse cholesterol transport” (RCT).
      The clear correlation between elevated levels of serum cholesterol and the development of coronary heart disease has been repeatedly confirmed, based on epidemiological and longitudinal studies.
      Hence, Apo A-I in HDL is thought to have an anti-inflammatory function and to restrain the occurrence and development of CHD. Furthermore, Apo A-I has shown to decrease the Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL) level in the blood and is known to bind to endotoxins, thus having a major role in the anti-endotoxin function of HDL.
      The “protective” role of HDL and Apo A-I as its major component has been confirmed in a number of studies making Apo A-I a promising candidate (particularly as part of a reconstituted HDL) for applications in atherosclerosis treatment, acute coronary syndrome treatment (ACS), anti-inflammation treatment, antitoxin treatment, liver-targeting drugs, etc.
      Human blood plasma is nowadays collected in large amounts and processed to individual fractions some of which contain apolipoprotein A-I. The fractions may be produced by ethanol fractionation according to a procedure originally developed in the United States and known as Cohn or Cohn-Oncley methods [E. J. Cohn et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 68, 459-475, 1946; J. L. Oncley et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 71, 541-550, 1949]. Plasma fractions containing apolipoproteins may also be produced by a variant of this method, the Kistler-Nitschmann procedure [H. Nitschmann et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 37, 866-873, 1954; P. Kistler and H. Nitschmann, Vox Sang 7, 414-424, 1962]. Both methods are based on differential precipitation in alcohol.
      Various approaches have been described in the literature to recover apolipoprotein A-I from ethanol precipitation fractions:
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,602 for instance, relates to the preparation of apolipoproteins from fractions of human blood plasma or serum by resuspending the fractions in an aqueous buffer solution in the pH range 3 to 5 or 6 to 9. Undesirable contaminants are precipitated by addition of a short chain aliphatic alcohol. Use is made of buffers containing high ethanol concentrations (68-96% ethanol) for precipitating contaminants. Potential aggregation of lipoproteins is inhibited through elevated temperature, slightly alkaline pH, or by the addition of chaotropic agents or surface-active substances, which is subsequently removed by gel filtration. An anion-exchange chromatography step is included to bind the contaminants, while the apolipoproteins pass through.
      Kim et al., Manufacturing and Shelf Stability of Reconstituted High- density Lipoprotein for Infusion Therapy, Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering 16, 785-792 (2011) disclose the use of extraction buffers containing urea in a concentration of 6 M.
      A combination of the two above mentioned methods is described in WO 98/07751 for recovering apolipoprotein A (Apo A-I) or apolipoprotein E (ApoE) from human plasma. Said document discloses a process comprising at least one pre-purification step through the use of an extraction buffer containing 8 M urea and a further purification step using anion-exchange chromatography. In WO 98/07751, 1% recovery of Apo A-I resulted from experiments using an extraction buffer comprising 20% ethanol. WO2009/025754 teaches methods to separate Apo A-I from alpha-1 antitrypsin including the use of lower ethanol concentrations (8 to 14%) to precipitate Apo A-I.
      Other methods such as ultra-speed centrifuge and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are also used to recover Apo A-I. However, the preparation of Apo A-I is extremely time-consuming and only minor quantities of Apo A-I can be prepared by these methods. These methods are therefore not suitable for an industrial production of Apo A-I.
      Thus, there remains a need for a method for extracting and recovering Apo A-I from Apo A-I containing protein fractions, which is suitable for large-scale production and which allows for acquiring Apo A-I in a high yield.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      Provided herein are processes of obtaining Apo A-I from an Apo A-I containing protein fraction (A), comprising a) suspending the Apo A-I containing protein fraction in a buffer solution comprising 15 to 30% of a linear or branched C 1 to C 4 alcohol (w/w) to form a suspension, wherein the suspended Apo A-I containing protein fraction (A) has a pH in the range from 6.4 to 10.0, (b) removing impurities from the suspension while keeping the Apo A-I proteins solubilized, (c) precipitating Apo A-I from the suspension, and (d) collecting the Apo A-I precipitate.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002584986,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      SHP-1, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase with two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, is a regulator of various intracellular signaling molecules, such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), KIT, CD22, CD5, CD72, SHPS-1, TIMP (metalloproteinases), CDK2, p27, SRC, ZAP70, IL-10, NF-κB, Lck, 3BP2, Lyn and cyclin D1.
      STAT3 is a transcription factor which regulates cell growth and survival by modulating the expression of target genes. It acts as an oncogene which is constitutively active in many cancers including liver, lung, head and neck, prostate, and breast as well as myeloma and leukemia. A key regulator of STAT3 activity is SHP-1. From a mechanistic perspective, SHP-1 exhibits protein phosphatase activity which reduces the level of Phospho-STAT3 (P-STAT) and subsequently blocks the dimerization of P-STAT3. Therefore, expression of target genes, such as cyclin D1 and survivin transcribed by STAT3, is significantly reduced. In addition, studies of SHP-1 protein and SHP-1 mRNA showed that expression level of SHP-1 was low in most cancer cells; and genetic increase in SHP-1 in cancer cells resulted in the suppression of cell growth, suggesting that the SHP-1 gene acts as a tumor suppressor. From the drug discovery point of view, development of a small molecule which can reduce P-STAT3 and increase SHP-1 level is a promising direction for cancer therapy. SHP-1 also play an important role in bone remodeling, a process of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Loss function of SHP-1 results in osteoclast and eventually leads to osteoporosis. Therefore, enhancement of SHP-1 activity might be a direction for osteoporosis patient. In addition, increase of SHP-1 is benefit for the macrophages of multiple sclerosis patients

","DISCLOSURE
      Turmeric is a curry spice obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa of the ginger family, and has a long history of use in ayurvedic medicine and in traditional Asian diets. The principal bioactive component of turmeric is curcumin (1,7-bis[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl]-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), a yellow pigment first identified in 1910. Curcumin is used widely in the United States for food coloring (e.g, in mustard, cheese, spices, cereals, potato flakes, soups, pickles, ice cream, and yogurt), and also as a nutraceutical. Recently, Curcumin has become a focus of pharmaceutical development. A June 2011 report stated that 61 clinical trials registered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health were completed or underway on the use of dietary curcumin in treating a variety of clinical disorders.
      Commercial curcumin contains curcumin itself (77%), desmethoxycurcumin (DMC, 17%) and bisdesmethoxycurcumin (BDMC, 3%); the latter two differ from curcumin only by lacking one or both methoxy groups, respectively. As a group these compounds and their derivatives for pharmaceutical use are referred to as curcuminoids. Among the major cellular metabolites of these three compounds are the tetrahydrocurcuminoids, in which both vinylidene groups are reduced, i.e., THC (tetrahydrocurcumin), TDMC (tetrahydrodesmethoxycurcumin) and TBDMC (tetrahydrobisdesmethoxycurcumin). The tetrahydrocurcuminoids retain the bioactivity but are colorless and more chemically stable than the curcuminoids.
      Curcumin's medicinal properties include reported effects that are antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal, antiteratogenic, antiproliferative and antimetaststic, and it is safe for human consumption even at the level of 8 g/day ingestion for sustained periods. Studies have shown that to varying degrees curcumin promotes wound healing and has therapeutic and or preventive effects against diabetes, asthma, allergies, cataracts, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, myelodysplastic syndromes, cystic fibrosis, myocardial infarctions, high cholesterol, stroke, malaria, HIV, HSV-1, psoriasis, and others. Among the diseases for which curcumin has ameliorative effects are autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, and several types of cancer.
      Medicinal use of curcumin has been limited because the compound is virtually insoluble (dissolution of only ca. 600 ng/mL) in water at acidic and physiological pH and hydrolyzes rapidly at alkaline pH. Plasma concentrations from high human oral doses (8-12 g/day) of curcumin are just in the nanomolar range. Most therapeutic in vitro studies on curcumin have solubilized it in organic solvents. Those solvents include dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), acetone and ethanol but they have limited suitability for in vivo studies themselves. Curcumin's poor solubility decreases its bioavailability throughout the body, and specifically at the brain, where curcumin does not readily cross the brain-blood barrier.
      Consequently, there is an ongoing need for methods and processes that enhance curcumin's bioavailability.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      Disclosed here are compositions comprising a curcuminoid-peptide complex. Also disclosed are methods of preparing a curcuminoid-peptide complex, comprising obtaining a curcuminoid; obtaining a peptide; and mixing the curcuminoid and the peptide in a solvent. Also disclosed are methods of treating a subject, the method comprising identifying a subject in need of treatment of a curcumin-related disorder, and administering to the subject a nutraceutical composition comprising a curcuminoid-peptide complex as described. Also disclosed are therapeutic compositions comprising a curcuminoid-peptide complex as described and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200900373,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      1. Field of the Invention
      The present invention relates to reconstituted surfactants which are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of RDS and other respiratory disorders. The present invention also relates to methods of preparing such a reconstituted surfactant and pharmaceutical compositions which contain such a reconstituted surfactant. The present invention further relates to methods for the treatment or prophylaxis of RDS and other respiratory disorders by administering such a reconstituted surfactant.
      2. Discussion of the Background
      The human lung is composed of a large number of small air sacs, called alveoli, in which gases are exchanged between the blood and the air spaces of the lungs. In healthy individuals, this exchange is mediated by the presence of a protein-containing surfactant complex that prevents the lungs from collapsing at the end of expiration.
      Lung surfactant complex is composed primarily of lipid and contains minor amounts of various proteins. An absence of adequate levels of this complex results in malfunction of the lung. This syndrome is called Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and it commonly affects preterm infants.
      Said syndrome is effectively treated with modified natural surfactant preparations extracted from animal lungs. Commercially available modified surfactant preparations are, for example, Curosurf, derived from porcine lung, Infasurf, extracted form calf lung lavage, and Survanta, a chemically modified natural bovine lung extract.
      The main constituents of these surfactant preparations are phospholipids, such as 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine commonly known as dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and surfactant hydrophobic proteins B and C (SP-B and SP-C).
      Due to the drawbacks of the surfactant preparations from animal tissues, such as the complication of the production and sterilization processes and possible induction of immune reactions, synthetic surfactants mimicking the composition of the modified natural surfactants have been developed. Said synthetic surfactants are known as reconstituted surfactants. However the development of clinically active reconstituted surfactants has turned out to be complicated since the native hydrophobic proteins are too big to synthesize, structurally complex, and unstable in pure form.
      In order to replace said native hydrophobic proteins, some synthetic polypeptides partially corresponding to their sequences and analogs thereof have been proposed in the prior art and are disclosed in for example WO 89/06657, WO 92/22315, WO 98/49191, WO 95/32992, U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,833, EP 413,957, and WO 91/18015.
      WO 00/47623 disclosed synthetic polypeptides which are analogs of the native protein SP-C wherein: i) cysteine residues in position 5 and 6 have been replaced by Ser residues; ii) the Val residues of the ‘center region’ of SP-C have been substituted with other neutral and hydrophobic residues selected from the group consisting of Leu, Ile, and norleucine (nL); iii) some of the neutral amino acids present in the ‘center region’ of SP-C have been replaced with bulky or polar residues selected from the group consisting of Lys, Trp, Phe, Tyr, and Ornithine. Said artificial polypeptides are characterized by the fact that they are capable of folding like the native protein SP-C and, hence, interacting properly with the surfactant lipids and, thus, do not give rise to self-oligomerization.
      WO 00/76535 generically discloses pulmonary surfactant preparations comprising at least one modification of the SP-B in combination with at least one modification of the SP-C protein.
      In A. J. Waring, et al., (abstract presented at the Paediatric Academy Society Annual meeting held in San Francisco on Apr. 29-May 2, 2006) a study was undertaken to examine the activity of a synthetic surfactant constituted of the SP-C-mimic, SP-Cff, that is a synthetic 34-residue SP-C with phenylalanine instead of cysteine in positions 4 and 5, and the SP-B-mimic, Mini-B.
      However, according to the available literature, in animal studies, the treatment with reconstituted surfactants gives rise to poor lung gas volumes and grade of alveolar patency at the end of expiration, and a ventilation is required with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in order to achieve an in vivo activity comparable to that achieved with modified natural surfactants (see, J. Johansson, et al., J. Appl. Physiol., 2003, 95, 2055-2063; and A. J. Davis, et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 1998; 157, 553-559). Thus, the available reconstituted surfactant preparations are indeed not capable of forming a stable phospholipidic film in the alveoli at the end of expiration.
      Moreover, all of the aforementioned documents are silent about the problem of the alveolar patency at the end of expiration and the effect of the disclosed preparations thereof.
      Thus, there remains a need for a reconstituted surfactant with improved properties in terms of lung compliance.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide novel reconstituted surfactants which are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of RDS and other respiratory disorders.
      It is another object of the present invention to provide novel reconstituted surfactants which are capable of guaranteeing alveolar stability, and hence maintaining alveolar patency at the end of expiration without requiring ventilation with PEEP.
      It is another object of the present invention to provide novel methods of preparing such a reconstituted surfactant.
      It is another object of the present invention to provide novel pharmaceutical compositions which contain such a reconstituted surfactant.
      It is another object of the present invention to provide novel methods of treating and/or preventing RDS and other respiratory disorders by administering such a reconstituted surfactant.
      These and other objects, which will become apparent during the following detailed description, have been achieved by the inventors' discovery that particular analogues of the native SP-C protein, and preferably the polypeptides of WO 00/47623 can advantageously be combined with particular analogues of the native protein SP-B in order to provide a reconstituted surfactant preparation with improved properties in terms of lung compliance, and in particular the ability to efficaciously maintain alveolar patency at the end of expiration without requiring ventilation with PEEP.
      Thus, in a first embodiment, the present invention provides a reconstituted surfactant comprising a lipid carrier, and a combination of a particular polypeptide analog of the native surfactant protein SP-C with a particular polypeptide analog of the native surfactant protein SP-B.
      In particular the invention provides a reconstituted surfactant comprising :
a) a lipid carrier;
b) a polypeptide of at least 20 amino acid residues and no more than 40 amino acid residues having the sequence represented by the general formula (I) (SEQ ID NO: 10):

wherein:
      each X is independently an amino acid residue selected from the group consisting of I, L, and nL;
      each B is independently an amino acid residue selected from the group consisting of K, R, H, W, F, Y, and Orn;
      each S is independently optionally substituted with an acyl group containing 12-22 carbon atoms, preferably 16 carbon atoms, linked to the side chain via an ester bond;
      Ω is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of M or M oxidized on the sulfur atom, I, L, and nL;
      a is an integer having a value of 1 to 8;
      b is an integer having a value of 1 to 19;
      each c is independently an integer having a value of 3 to 8;
      e, f, g, and p are each independently integers having a value of 0 or 1;
      each n is independently an integer having a value of 0 to 3; and
with the condition that the XaBXb(BXc)n is a sequence having a maximum of 22 amino acid residues; and
c) a polypeptide represented by the general formula (II) (SEQ ID NO: 11):
c) a polypeptide represented by the general formula (II) (SEQ ID NO: 11):

wherein:
      Δ is an amino acid residue independently selected from the group consisting of W and L;
      each Ω is independently an amino acid residue selected from the group consisting of M, I, L, and nL;
      Φ is an amino acid residue independently selected from the group consisting of R and T, preferably R; and
      each f is independently an integer having a value of 0 or 1,
      wherein F, G, I, P, S, V, H, L, K, R, A, C, Q, W, Y, M, and T are standard one-letter symbols for amino acid residues, nL represents an L-nor-leucine residue, and Orn represents an L-onithine residue.
      The present invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said polypeptides and their blocked N- and/or C-terminus derivatives, e.g via acetylation and amidation.
      The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions which contain such a reconstituted surfactant.
      The present invention also provides methods for improving the alveolar patency at the end of expiration by administering such a reconstituted surfactant.
      The present invention also provides methods for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and other respiratory disorders, by administering to a patient in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a reconstituted surfactant comprising a lipid carrier, a polypeptide of general formula (I), and a polypeptide of general formula (II).
      In particular it has been found that, in a model of RDS wherein the immature newborn were treated with exogenous surfactant preparations without applying PEEP, a combination of said particular analogues of the proteins SP-C and SP-B acts on the lung gas volumes which is an index of the alveolar patency at the end of expiration.

      Secretory production of heterologous proteins by coryneform bacteria has also been reported, specifically secretion of a nuclease and a lipase by Corynebacterium glutamicum (henceforth also abbreviated as C. glutamicum) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,197 and J. Bacteriol., 174, 1854-1861 (1992)), secretion of a protease such as subtilisin (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 61, 1610-1613 (1995)), secretion of a protein using signal peptides of cell surface layer proteins PS1 and PS2 (also referred to as CspB) of coryneform bacteria (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kohyo) No. 6-502548), secretion of a fibronectin-binding protein using the signal peptide of PS2 (CspB) (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 63, 4392-4400 (1997)), secretion of protransglutaminase using signal peptides of cell surface layer proteins PS2 (CspB) and SlpA (also referred to as CspA) of coryneform bacteria (Japanese Patent No. 4320769), secretion of a protein using a variant type secretion system (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 11-169182), secretion of a protransglutaminase by a variant strain (Japanese Patent No. 4362651), secretion of a protein using a Tat-dependent signal peptide (Japanese Patent No. 4730302), and so forth.
      Various proteins have been suggested as proteins which could be produced by secretory production; however, in coryneform bacteria, there are no reports of secretory production of any multimeric protein, such as, for example, antibody-related molecules.
      Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) is a generic term which describes proteins that bind with β-lactam type antibiotics, and as a result, inhibit binding with β-lactam type antibiotics. PBPs are generally membrane-binding proteins, and they are considered essential for cell wall synthesis of eubacteria. PBPs are classified as high molecular weight PBPs (HMW-PBPs) or low molecular weight PBPs (LMW-PBPs), according to their molecular weights. HMW-PBPs are further classified as class A high molecular weight PBPs (class A HMW-PBPs), which have both a transpeptidase activity domain for crosslinking peptidoglycan moieties, and a transglycosylase activity domain for forming a polysaccharide chain from disaccharides, and class B high molecular weight PBPs (class B HMW-PBPs) which have only a transpeptidase activity domain.
      The findings about PBPs of C. glutamicum are detailed in Mol. Microbiol., 66, 643-57 (2007), Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek, 94, 99-109 (2008), Mol. Microbiol., 9, 97-109 (1993), and J. Biotechnol., 112, 177-193 (2004). In C. glutamicum, at least nine PBP homologues have been found so far. Five of them are HMW-PBPs including two class A HMW-PBPs (PBP1a, PBP1b), and three class B HMW-PBPs (FtsI, PBP2a, PBP2b). It is known that the class A HMW-PBPs of C. glutamicum are responsible for cell extension, and the class B HMW-PBPs are responsible for formation of peptidoglycan of septal walls at the time of cell division.
      Cell surface layer proteins are proteins constituting the cell surface layers (S-layers) of bacteria and archaea. As the cell surface layer proteins of coryneform bacteria, PS1 and PS2 (CspB) of C. glutamicum (Mol. Microbiol., 9, 97-109 (1993)), SlpA (CspA) of C. stationis (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kohyo) No. 6-502548), and so forth are known. Regarding PS2 (CspB), for example, amino acid sequences of CspB homologues of 28 strains of C. glutamicum have been reported (J. Biotechnol., 112, 177-193 (2004)). As described above, signal peptides of cell surface layer proteins of coryneform bacteria are utilized in secretory productions of proteins (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kohyo) No. 6-502548; Japanese Patent No. 4320769, and so forth).
      However, the relationship between the decrease in the activity of a penicillin-binding protein and/or the decrease in the activity of a cell surface layer protein, and the secretory production of a heterologous protein has not been previously reported.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002492184,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Hemostasis is the mechanism by means of which living beings respond to a hemorrhage and involves the participation of two processes that become functional immediately after a lesion and remain active for a long period of time. The first of them is known as primary hemostasis and is characterized by the occurrence of vasoconstriction at the vascular lesion site and platelet aggregate formation. The second one is known as secondary hemostasis, being the phase in which the fibrin clot is formed due to the action of the different coagulation cascade proteolytic enzymes.
      Several cofactors and proteolytic enzymes participate in the second phase of the blood coagulation process, all referred to as coagulation factors, and it consists of several phases ending with fibrin formation from fibrinogen hydrolysis due to the action of thrombin. Thrombin is previously formed by proteolytic hydrolysis of an apoenzyme, prothrombin. This proteolysis is carried out by the activated coagulation Factor X (FXa), which binds to the surface of the activated platelets and only in the presence of its cofactor, activated coagulation Factor V (FVa), and calcium ions, and is able to hydrolyze prothrombin. Coagulation Factor X (FX) activation can occur in two separate pathways, the intrinsic pathway and the extrinsic pathway.
      The intrinsic pathway consists of a series of reactions in which each proenzyme is hydrolyzed, yielding its active protease form. In each step, the recently formed proteolytic enzyme will catalyze activation of the following proenzyme to successively yield the active form.
      In the blood coagulation extrinsic pathway, the Tissue Factor (TF), exposed on adventitia cells at the lesion site, binds to circulating coagulation Factor VII/activated coagulation Factor VII (FVII/FVIa) to form the TF::FVIIa complex and, in the presence of calcium, to act as a substrate so that FX activation takes place. The extrinsic pathway is currently considered the most relevant pathway in blood coagulation, and it is accepted that in the event of a hemorrhage produced by a vascular lesion, coagulation is triggered due to extrinsic pathway activation involving the interaction of TF with its ligand, FVII/FVIIa.
      TF consists of a protein component (previously referred to as tissue factor apoprotein-III) and a phospholipid. TF specifically binds to FVII/FVIIa and plays a relevant role in the blood coagulation extrinsic pathway. The physiological roles assigned to TF are well known; on the one hand, it is a receptor specific for FVIIa and, once the TF::FVIIa complex has been formed, it acts as a substrate so that FX activation takes place. In fact, after a vascular lesion, TF, which is normally sequestered on the surface of adventitia cells externally surrounding blood vessels, comes into contact and interacts with its ligand, FVII present in blood, to form the TF::FVII complex. Once this complex is formed, FVII autoactivation takes place, yielding its active form (FVIIa).
      Glycosylation is an enzyme directed site specific process by which saccharides are added to lipids and proteins. It is believed that this process is involved in stability, folding, and transport; although no evidence of its real function has been described for TF.
      It has been broadly accepted that TF is the main element responsible for the quickness with which coagulation is initiated. For coagulation to begin, it is absolutely necessary for FX to be activated and begin prothrombin hydrolysis. The source of this FXa has mainly been attributed to the interaction of FVIIa with its receptor, TF.
      Purification of TF has been reported from various tissues such as: human brain, bovine brain; human placenta; ovine brain; and, lung. It is widely accepted that while there are differences in structure of TF protein between species there are no functional differences as measured by in vitro coagulation assays.
      It is widely accepted that in order to demonstrate biological activity, TF must be associated with phospholipids in vitro. It has been shown that the removal of the phospholipid component of TF, for example by use of a phospholipase, results in a loss of its biological activity in vitro. Relipidation can restore in vitro TF activity.
      While some quantities of “purified” TF protein have been available as obtained from various tissues, the low concentration of TF protein in blood and tissues and the high cost, both economic and of effort, of purifying the protein from tissues makes this a scarce material. Therefore, there is a need to look for an alternative source of TF protein, advantageously lipidated TF protein.
      The TF protein has been expressed in various systems using the cloned human cDNA. Thus, over-expression of TF protein in E. coli has been reported (Paborsky et al., Biochemistry 28, 8072 (1989)). Further, U.S. Pat. No. 6,261,803 discloses a process for preparing functional recombinant TF in a prokaryotic host organism. High expression yield of the complete TF protein is achieved in E. coli.
      Although heterologous expression of proteins in E. coli presents some advantages, the expression of eukaryotic proteins in said bacteria is associated with a large number of problems, mainly when the protein to be expressed is a glycosylated eukaryotic protein, due to the lack in bacteria of their own glycosylation systems.
      An alternative strategy consists, therefore, in expressing a mutated TF protein which lacks the transmembrane domain. This so-called “soluble” TF (or “truncated” TF) accumulates in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cells and can be expressed in relatively large quantities. However, in this system, the TF protein so expressed is usually present in E. coli in a quasicrystalline state in the form of so-called inclusion bodies. When this is the case, the inclusion bodies have to be solubilized by using very large quantities of chaotropic agents, and the proteins which have been monomerized in this way have then once again to be refolded, with a great deal of effort and usually with only a low yield, into an active, renatured confirmation. Further, in principle, the soluble TF is not suitable for use in prothrombin time reagents since it lacks the domain for the interaction with phospholipids.
      Another approach for over-expressing TF protein is that of using a large number of known and successfully employed expression systems which encode products of gene fusions (e.g. with β-galactosidase, MalE, glutathione transferase, His-tag, etc.). However, these systems are not suitable for expressing biologically active TF. Although expression products can be detected and the level of expression can also be increased when said systems are used, the expression products so obtained are sometimes associated with a complete loss of function, which cannot be restored, either, even using elaborate renaturation methods.
      The problems of over-expression of TF protein in E. coli can be circumvented by carrying out the expression of said protein in a eukaryotic system. Thus, expression in yeast cells, in insect cell cultures using baculovirus as a vector, or in cultured mammalian cells, e.g., hamster ovary cells, or in human cell lines, is, in principle, suitable. However, these systems suffer from crucial disadvantages, among others; recombinant protein yields are much lower when compared to recombinant E. coli production.
      Yeast strains combine the advantages of the above distinct host systems. On one hand, they more closely mimic the native physiology of an eukaryotic protein than E. coli, and, on the other hand, they are ease of handling, ease of culturing, present much faster growth and much greater economy. Several factors though, affect the expression of proteins in yeast as well. These factors include, but are not confined to:
the choice of the gene regulatory sequences, such as promoters, that control the expression of an heterologous protein; the promoter sequences employed for controlling heterologous expression should typically be “strong”, i.e., they should effect very high expression of the protein, and suitably controllable, whereby the expression may at first be efficiently repressed until an optimum biomass of the culture is reached and then quickly switched on to effect protein expression; and
an efficient secretion of the expressed heterologous protein; secretion of the expressed protein (extracellular expression) is often preferred over intracellular expression as the latter would first entail breaking open the cell, thus disgorging the entire cellular contents, and then isolating the desired protein from the cesspool of cellular material and debris. Yet efficient secretion of a protein in turn depends on several factors including: (i) the choice of the signal sequences-peptide sequences which are usually the N-terminal regions of naturally secreted proteins, and which direct the protein into the cellular secretory pathway, and, (ii) the specific components of the secretory pathway that interact with signal sequences and effect the secretion of the attached protein.

      Stone M. J. et al (Biochem. J. (1995) 310, 605-614) describe the expression of the surface domain of TF (truncated TF) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For TF purification, cultures were loaded onto an immunoaffinity column conjugated with an anti-TF antibody and the protein is eluted and dialysed. This assay allowed access to milligram quantities of truncated TF.
      Brucato C. L. et al. (Protein Expression and Purification 26 (2002), 386-393) describe expression of the mature full-length recombinant rabbit TF protein in Pichia pastoris. Purification of TF protein is carried out by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography.
      There is so far no known process for preparing large quantities of biologically active, recombinant TF from yeast in high yield. Advantageously, said recombinant TF should be obtained at a high level of activity, preferably, at a level of activity suitable for therapeutical uses. Hence, it is an object of the present invention to generate useful quantities of lipidated TF protein using recombinant techniques. Advantageously, the recombinant TF protein should be useful for therapeutical applications.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002499053,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Immunoglobulins (IgGs) are complex heteromultimeric proteins with characteristic affinity for specific antigenic counterparts of various natures. Today, routine isolation of IgG-producing cell lines, and the advent of technologies for IgG directed evolution and molecular engineering have profoundly impacted their evolution as biotherapeutics and in the general life science market. Therapeutic monoclonal IgG (monoclonal antibodies, mAbs) dominate the current market of new anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drugs and hundreds of new candidates are currently under research and clinical development for improved or novel applications. The annual market demand for mAbs ranges from a few grams (diagnostics), a few kilograms (anti-toxin) to up to one or several hundreds of kilograms (bio-defense, anti-cancer, anti-infectious, anti-inflammatory).
      Although CHO cell culture is still their preferred production host at commercial scale, it is generally accepted that for mAbs to reach their full impact on the life science market, alternative production systems have to be developed, as the facilities required for these cultures are not easily modulated in scale, their building and maintenance costs are extremely high and steadily increasing, and their validation under GMP still requires an average of three years following construction. Even at the early development stages, the selection of CHO cell lines with acceptable yields and productivity remains a costly and long process. New production systems that would decrease the upstream costs (higher yields, simpler technologies and infrastructures), have shorter lead time, be more flexible in capacity, while meeting the current reproducibility, quality and safety features of current cell culture systems are likely to have a significant impact on the development of mAbs and vaccines for the life science market, at every development stages.
      Plants are suitable hosts for the production of mAbs and several other proteins which have current applications in life sciences (see Ko and Koprowski 2005; Ma et al., 2005; Yusibov et al., 2006 for recent reviews). MAbs have been produced in stable transgenic plant lines at yields up to 200 mg/kg fresh weight (FW), and through transient expression at rates of up to 20 mg/kg FW (Kathuria, 2002). Giritch et al. (2006) report expression levels of 200-300 mg/kg of leaf weight for an IgG, with one cited maximum of 500 mg/kg through the use of a multi-virus based transient expression system.
      Plant and mammalian N-glycosylation process differ. The later steps of N-glycosylation in mammalian cells add β1,4galactose, α1,6fucose (beta-1,4-galactose, alpha-1,6fucose) and terminal sialic acid residues to complex glycans. However, in plants β1,3galactose, α1,3fucose (beta-1,3galactose, alpha-1,3fucose), α1,4-fucose and β1,2xylose (alpha-1,4-fucose and beta-1,2xylose) residues are added. Alpha-1,3fucose and β1,2xylose being constituents of glyco-epitopes of some plant allergens, these residues are considered potentially immunogenic and their occurrence on therapeutic proteins, including antibodies is undesired.
      The addition of a KDEL sequence to the C-Terminal of a peptide is typically used to ensure retrieval of the peptide from the Golgi back to the ER. This approach has been used to produce a non-fucosylated and non-xylosylated antibody using agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves (Sriraman et al., 2004). However, the added KDEL peptide is potentially immunogenic, and this approach has limited applicability to the production of therapeutic proteins.
      Control of α1,3fucose (alpha-1,3fucose) and β1,2xylose (beta-1,2xylose) addition has also been attained by modifying expression of fucosyltransferase and xylosyltransferase. Mutants lacking the capacity to add α1,3fucose and β1,2xylose on complex glycans have been produced in a moss ( Physcomitrella patens; Koprivova et al., 2004) and Arabidopsis thaliana (Strasser et al., 2004). Partial inhibition of plant fucosyltransferase and xylosyltransferase expression has also been achieved by expression of interfering RNAs (RNAi) targeted to α1,3fucosyltransferase and β1,2xylosyltransferase genes in Lemna minor (Cox et al., 2006). However complete inhibition of these enzymatic activities have deleterious effects on several plant species, since they interfere with key developmental events such as pollen formation or seed set. RNAi-induced specific degradation of mRNA may not be stable over time, and it may not applicable to a large spectrum of plant-based platforms used for the production of therapeutics since it has been reported to be sensitive to environmental factors.
      WO 03/078637 discloses the use of human galactosyltransferase to catalyze the addition of terminal β1,4 galactose (GalT) on plant glycans. Expression of GalT, and targeting of its activity to the cis Golgi through the use of a fusion with the transmembrane domain of a xylosyltransferase resulted in the addition of terminal galactose and a decrease in N-glycans bearing plant specific residues (see also Bakker et al., 2006). Breeding these plants with plants containing a recombinant IgG resulted in a significant but variable decrease in glycans containing fucose and xylose.
      The attachment of a beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlnNAc) residue to beta-linked mannose to produce a bisected GlcNac is catalyzed by N-acetylglucosaminyltrasnferase III (GnT-III; EC 2.4.1.144). Introduction of this enzyme into plants has been described (Rouwendal et al., 2007), and plants expressing GnT-III comprised proteins with complex N-glycans were bisected and carried two GlnAc residues.

      According to the methods described herein a protein of interest may therefore be produced in high yield and that lack glycans that are known to be involved in hypersensitivity reactions, or be otherwise involved in allergenic reactions. This is accomplished by co-expressing glyco-engineered enzymes along with the protein of interest, and this result in the production of a less immunogenic protein than would be produced within the wild-type plant.
      As described herein, a simplified expression systems for the production of a protein of interest using a transient expression system may be used, however, the methods may also be used with stable transformation systems.

      By using transient co-expression, the system described herein avoids the lengthy production times, and the selection process of elite mutant or glyco-engineered transgenic lines and their subsequent use as parental lines (e.g. as described by Bakker, 2005). It also avoids the concurrent problems often encountered with mutant or glyco-engineered plants, in terms of productivity, pollen production, seed set (Bakker et al 2005) and viability (Boisson et al., 2005). As described herein, co-expression of a protein of interest with a modifying chimeric human galactosyltransferase had no effect on production kinetics or yields.
      The transient expression system described herein yields expression levels reaching 1.5 g of high quality antibody per kilogram of leaf fresh weight, exceeding the accumulation level reported for any antibody in plants with other expression systems, including multi-virus based systems and transgenic plants.
      The approach described herein, for example involving expression of GalT or GalT-GNT1, may also be used with stably transformed plants. While exhibiting many advantages described above, this invention is not limited to transient expression systems.
      This summary of the invention does not necessarily describe all features of the invention.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002613906,"BACKGROUND
(a) Technical Field
      The present disclosure relates to a protein-active agent conjugate. The protein (e.g., an oligopeptide, a polypeptide, an antibody, or the like) has substrate specificity for a desired target, and the active agent (e.g., a drug, a toxin, a ligand, a detection probe, and the like) has a specific function or activity. The disclosure also relates to methods for preparing the conjugate. The disclosure further relates to methods of using the conjugate to deliver an active agent to a target cell in a subject, as well as methods for treating a subject in need of the active agent (e.g., a subject having cancer).
(b) Background Art
      Methods for inhibiting growth of cancer cells by targeted delivery of anti-cancer agents have been proposed. For example, it has been shown that targeted delivery of an antibody-drug conjugate can kill a particular cancer cell. As the antibody (or antibody fragment) specifically binds the cancer cell, the drug is delivered to the target cancer cell. Targeted delivery of the drug ensures that the drug acts on the target cancer cell instead of normal host cells, thereby minimizing the side effects resulting from damage to normal cells.
      Antibody conjugates can be used to deliver chemical and/or biological molecules. Exemplary chemical and/or biological molecules include a drug conventionally used in chemical treatment, a bacterial protein toxin (e.g., diphtheria toxin), a plant protein toxin (e.g., ricin), a small molecule toxin (e.g., auristatin, geldanamycin, maytansinoid, calicheamycin, daunomycin, methotrexate, vindesine, and tubulysin), an affinity ligand, a detection probe (e.g., fluorescent probe, radioactive probe), and the like (including combinations thereof).
      Antibody-drug conjugates that have been proposed thus far are prepared by bonding a drug moiety with a plurality of lysine groups of an antibody. Alternatively, antibody-drug conjugates are prepared by reducing all or part of the interchain disulfide groups of an antibody or reducing all the interchain disulfide groups followed by partial oxidation to thereby give free cysteine thiol groups, and then bonding the free cysteine thiol groups with a drug moiety.
Existing preparation methods, however, have some problems. For example, the overall preparation process is complicated because the antibody-drug conjugates prepared by the existing preparation methods are not uniform (homogeneous). When antibody-drug conjugates are prepared by bonding a drug moiety with lysine groups, various types and forms of antibody-drug conjugates are obtained due to the presence of many lysine groups in the antibody (e.g., 100 lysine groups per antibody). Similarly, when preparing antibody-drug conjugates by bonding thiol groups with a drug moiety, a mixture of diastereomers is obtained due to bonding between thiol groups and maleimide groups. For example, if n drugs are conjugated, a mixture of 2 n stereoisomers is obtained. Thus, where the drug distribution number is 0-8 (e.g., where interchain disulfide groups are reduced), a mixture of
(NB) of stereoisomers is obtained. In addition, where i drugs are conjugated with q sites, a mixture of
(NB) of different compounds is obtained.
      Furthermore, when preparing antibody-drug conjugates by bonding lysine groups with a drug moiety, the electric charge of the lysine groups may be lost, thereby causing the antibody to lose its unique antigen specificity. Likewise, the tertiary or quaternary structure of the antibody may not be maintained when preparing antibody-drug conjugates by reducing disulfide groups, thereby causing the antibody to be inactivated or become a non-specific antibody. When preparing antibody-drug conjugates by using thiol-maleimide bonding, the drug may be cleaved (non-specifically) from the conjugates via, e.g., a reverse reaction.
      To overcome the problems associated with the prior preparation methods, an alternative method was proposed in which amino acid groups in particular positions of an antibody are replaced with cysteine groups. Although this method shows better result than the prior preparation methods in terms of toxicity, activity, and safety, this method still involves thiol-maleimide bonding and thus suffers from the diastereomer and instability problems associated with thiol-maleimide bonding. Another alternative method was proposed in which selenocysteine groups are attached to the carboxy terminals of an antibody.
      In addition to use of cysteine substitutions to control the site of conjugation, Ambrx Technology (at the World Wide Web (www) ambrx.com) has been working toward incorporating non-natural amino acids in the antibody to provide functional groups that can be used for linker chemistry. Ambrx's expression systems contain tRNA synthetases that aminoacylate the original tRNA with a non-natural amino acid, thereby inserting a non-natural amino acid whenever the amber stop is encountered.
      Redwood Bioscience's (at the World Wide Web (www) redwoodbioscience.com) technology employs genetically encoded aldehyde tags and aims to exploit a specific sequence that is posttranslationally recognized and modified by an enzyme, i.e., a formyl glycine-generating enzyme, to produce a so-called aldehyde chemical handle. The incorporation of a CxPxR sequence at specific positions in the antibody provides a means to produce a reactive aldehyde amenable to drug conjugation.
      However, in view of the above-mentioned problems in the art pertaining to making antibody-drug conjugates, new antibody-drug conjugates and new methods of making antibody-drug conjugates are highly desirable.
      The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
"
0002483065,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Integrated circuits (or chips) typically comprise a silicon substrate with semiconductor devices, such as transistors, formed from doped regions within the substrate. Interconnect structures, also referred to as metallization layers, comprising substantially parallel conductive layers connected by substantially vertical conductive vias, provide electrical connection between doped regions to form electrical circuits within the integrated circuit. Typically several metallization layers are required to interconnect the doped regions in the integrated circuit. The top metallization layer provides attachment sites for receiving conductive interconnects (e.g., bond wires) that connect the integrated circuit to terminals (e.g., pins or leads) of a chip package structure, which further connect the integrated circuit to off-chip electronic components.
       Integrated circuits are designed to operate at a nominal power supply voltage and within predetermined temperature limits. However, it is known that the integrated circuit can likely be safely and reliably operated within a supply voltage tolerance range above and below the nominal voltage and within a temperature tolerance range above and below the nominal temperature. Power supply voltage and/or temperature excursions outside design limits can cause immediate failure or reduce integrated circuit life. It is generally known that design or process modifications can be implemented to extend the supply voltage and temperature tolerance, thereby increasing the reliability margin of the integrated circuit, but at the expense of increased fabrication costs.
       The expected lifetime of an integrated circuit is influenced by the voltage and temperature at which it is operated, in addition to the effects of anomalies that may occur during the fabrication process. To estimate the expected lifetime, a reliability failure analyses is performed by subjecting the fabricated chip to accelerated life testing, also referred to as stress testing. The reliability failure analysis is based on a worst-case operating scenario, considering the manufacturing processes employed to fabricate the chip and the chip's operational environment and anticipated use pattern, the latter including out-of-tolerance voltage and temperature conditions to which the chip might be subjected. By extrapolation from the chip performance data collected during these tests, the expected lifetime under normal operating conditions can be determined. Expected aging effects as a function of the chip's operating life, assuming the integrated circuit is operated within design limits, can also be determined. For example, an integrated circuit fabricated according to a specific technology may be rated at an operating voltage of 1.2 volts and have a ten year expected lifetime according to the accelerated life tests. It can also be determined from the accelerated tests that operating the chip at five volts reduces it lifetime to a nominal five years. Thus this chip would be expected to operate successfully at five volts in a system having a five year life or at 1.2 volts in a system having a ten year life.
       Changes in manufacturing processes and the continual progression to smaller and denser devices may contribute to an erosion of the reliability margin, resulting in increased risk of premature chip failure. As semiconductor integrated circuits are scaled to smaller dimensions, the requirement to maintain operation within the power supply voltage and temperature limits becomes more critical. For instance, for integrated circuits comprising metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET's) with gate oxides having a thickness of less than about 2.5 nm, subjecting the integrated circuit to a power supply voltage of about 5% over the nominal voltage can reduce the expected mean lifetime from about ten years to about six years. If typical temperature specification limits (e.g., 90° to 125° C.) are exceeded, the chip lifetime can also be reduced.
       Failure of an integrated circuit embedded within a system will likely cause a failure of the system, an unfortunate outcome that can be expensive and disruptive to the system user. For example, failure of a disk drive requires purchase of a replacement drive and entails a data recovery cost. Consequential losses such as data recovery can be costly and can easily exceed the hardware replacement cost. System redundancy is commonly employed to avoid the effects of component faults or defects that lead to a system failure. However, redundant systems incur an extra cost, i.e., a doubled cost.
       Generally, when an integrated circuit fails in the field and is returned to the supplier for a failure analysis, it is difficult for the chip supplier to determine the failure's root cause, especially since the supplier lacks knowledge of voltage or temperature stresses or other operational abuses to which the integrated circuit may have been exposed during operation. This type of information, if available, could be invaluable to the supplier during a post-failure analysis.
       In addition to after-the-fact failure analysis, a warning of a possible integrated circuit failure can be valuable to the end user, providing an opportunity to avoid or minimize consequential losses. Given the widespread use of integrated circuits in hardware devices, including life saving devices (e.g., biomedical implants) and mission critical devices (telecommunications devices and financial transaction devices), a warning of an impending failure allows the user to replace the hardware device and avoid a costly breakdown. Even when used in commonplace personal computers and appliances, a warning can prevent an annoying failure and the consequences thereof Unlike mechanical systems that generally provide a failure warning (e.g., excessive or unusual noise emanating from the system), electronic systems provide virtly no warning prior to a complete failure. Thus, the ability to warn the user that a failure might occur in the near term can be particularly advantageous.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
201190280,"BACKGROUND
      Diabetes mellitus are disorders in which high levels of blood glucose occur as a consequence of abnormal glucose homeostasis. The most common forms of diabetes mellitus are Type I (also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) and Type II diabetes (also referred to as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus). Type II diabetes, accounting for roughly 90% of all diabetic cases, is a serious progressive disease that results in microvascular complications (including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy) as well as macrovascular complications (including accelerated atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease and stroke).
      Currently, there is no cure for diabetes. Standard treatments for the disease are limited, and focus on controlling blood glucose levels to minimize or delay complications. Current treatments target either insulin resistance (metformin, thiazolidinediones, or insulin release from beta cells (sulphonylureas, exanatide). Sulphonylureas and other compounds that act via depolarization of the beta cell promote hypoglycemia as they stimulate insulin secretion independent of circulating glucose concentrations. One approved drug, exanatide, stimulates insulin secretion only in the presence of high glucose, but must be injected due to a lack of oral bioavailability. Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, is a new drug that increases blood levels of incretin hormones, which can increase insulin secretion, reduce glucagon secretion and have other less well characterized effects. However, sitagliptin and other dipeptidyl peptidases IV inhibitors may also influence the tissue levels of other hormones and peptides, and the long-term consequences of this broader effect have not been fully investigated.
      In Type II diabetes, muscle, fat and liver cells fail to respond normally to insulin. This condition (insulin resistance) may be due to reduced numbers of cellular insulin receptors, disruption of cellular signaling pathways, or both. At first, the beta cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin output. Eventually, however, the beta cells become unable to produce sufficient insulin to maintain normal glucose levels (euglycemia), indicating progression to Type II diabetes.
      In Type II diabetes, fasting hyperglycemia occurs due to insulin resistance combined with beta cell dysfunction. There are two aspects of beta cell defect dysfunction: 1) increased basal insulin release (occurring at low, non-stimulatory glucose concentrations). This is observed in obese, insulin-resistant pre-diabetic stages as well as in Type II diabetes, and 2) in response to a hyperglycemic challenge, a failure to increase insulin release above the already elevated basal level. This does not occur in pre-diabetic stages and may signal the transition from normo-glycemic insulin-resistant states to frank Type II diabetes. Current therapies to treat the latter aspect include inhibitors of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel to trigger the release of endogenous insulin stores, and administration of exogenous insulin. Neither achieves accurate normalization of blood glucose levels and both carry the risk of eliciting hypoglycemia.
      Thus, there has been great interest in the discovery of agents that function in a glucose-dependent manner. Physiological signaling pathways which function in this way are well known, including gut peptides GLP-1 and GIP. These hormones signal via cognate G-protein coupled receptors to stimulate production of cAMP in pancreatic beta-cells. Increased cAMP apparently does not result in stimulation of insulin release during the fasting or pre-prandial state. However, a number of biochemical targets of cAMP, including the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, voltage-sensitive potassium channels and the exocytotic machinery, are modulated such that insulin secretion due to postprandial glucose stimulation is significantly enhanced. Therefore, agonist modulators of novel, similarly functioning, beta-cell GPCRs, including GPR119, would also stimulate the release of endogenous insulin and promote normalization of glucose levels in Type II diabetes patients. It has also been shown that increased cAMP, for example as a result of GLP-1 stimulation, promotes beta-cell proliferation, inhibits beta-cell death and thus improves islet mass. This positive effect on beta-cell mass should be beneficial in Type II diabetes where insufficient insulin is produced.
      It is well known that metabolic diseases have negative effects on other physiological systems and there is often co-occurrence of multiple disease states (e.g. Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, inadequate glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, obesity or cardiovascular disease in “Syndrome X”) or secondary diseases which occur secondary to diabetes such as kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, treatment of the diabetic condition should be of benefit to such interconnected disease states.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200970402,"BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
","DISCLOSURE
      Mammalian protein kinases are important regulators of cellular functions. Because disfunctions in protein kinase activity have been associated with several diseases and disorders, protein kinases are targets for drug development. The Tyrosine kinase family, and particularly the subset of receptor tyrosine kinases, is enriched with proven and putative cancer targets. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, HER2, KIT and KDR are well characterized proteins with a clearly established role in cancer. Drugs targeting these RTKs, such as Gleevec, Iressa, and Tarceva, have been approved for the treatment of certain cancers. Other RTKs are less well characterized but have also been implicated in cancer. For example, emerging data suggests that inhibitors of TRKC, ROS, CSF1R/FMS and ALK may be useful in the treatment of cancer. MET and RON are two particularly attractive RTK targets for the development of new agents to treat cancer.
      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor, is a multi-functional growth factor that enhances transformation and tumor development by inducing mitogenesis and cell motility. Further, HGF promotes metastasis by stimulating cell motility and invasion through various signaling pathways. In order to produce cellular effects, HGF must bind to its receptor, c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase. c-Met, a widely expressed heterodimeric protein comprising of a 50 kilodalton (kDa) α-subunit and a 145 kDa β-subunit (Maggiora et al., J. Cell Physiol., 173:183-186, 1997), is overexpressed in a significant percentage of human cancers and is amplified during the transition between primary tumors and metastasis. The various cancers in which c-Met overexpression is implicated include, but are not limited to, gastric adenocarcinoma, renal cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, brain cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. c-Met is also implicated in atherosclerosis and lung fibrosis.
      MET was first identified as a transforming DNA rearrangement (TPR-MET) in a human osteosarcoma cell line that had been treated with N-methyl-N′-nitro-nitrosoguanidine (Cooper et al. 1984). The MET receptor tyrosine kinase (also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor, HGFR, MET or c-Met) and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (“HGF”) have numerous biological activities including the stimulation of proliferation, survival, differentiation and morphogenesis, branching tubulogenesis, cell motility and invasive growth. Pathologically, MET has been implicated in the growth, invasion and metastasis of many different forms of cancer including kidney cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer and breast cancer. Somatic, activating mutations in MET have been found in human carcinoma metastases and in sporadic cancers such as papillary renal cell carcinoma. There is also evidence the MET signaling pathway can play an important role in resistance to cancer therapies. For example, the MET gene has been found to be amplified in lung cancer patients that have relapsed after initial response to EGFR inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotininb. In addition to cancer there is evidence that MET inhibition may have value in the treatment of various indications including: Listeria invasion, osteolysis associated with multiple myeloma, malaria infection, diabetic retinopathies, psoriasis, and arthritis. Mutations in the MET coding sequence are relatively uncommon in human cancers. However, based on the precedent of the selection of BCR-ABL mutations in chronic myelogenous leukemia patients treated with imatinib and EGFR mutations in cancer patients treated with erlotinib and gefitinib, these and/or perhaps additional MET mutations that might confer drug resistance are predicted to become increasingly prevalent if MET inhibitors become widely use in cancer. Therefore drugs that effectively inhibit some of these MET mutations could become very important tools in future cancer therapies.
      MET is closely related to a group of five receptor tyrosine kinases which have not been as thoroughly studied as MET itself. These include Tyro3/Sky, MER, AXL, RYK and RON. The tyrosine kinase RON is the receptor for the macrophage stimulating protein and is the closest relative of MET, belonging to the MET family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Like MET, RON is implicated in growth, invasion and metastasis of several different forms of cancer including colorectal cancer and bladder cancer. There is also evidence that deregulated AXL and MER can play important roles in cancer. MER has many properties consistent with activity as an oncogene. Transgenic mice expressing MER in the hematopoietic lineage develop symptoms similar to T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and it is expressed in most T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients. Studies in mouse models suggested that AXL is important for the growth of breast cancer where AXL appeared to regulate both angiogenic and tumorigenic processes. Additional studies with human cancer cell lines suggest that AXL is involved in NSCLC metastasis and drug resistance. Although very little is known of the normal and pathological roles of Tyro3/Sky this receptor tyrosine kinase shares certain properties and functions with its better studied relatives and may also eventually prove to have an important role in cancer. RYK is also expressed in certain cancers but it is an atypical orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that lacks detectable kinase activity and thus its tractability as a target for small molecule cancer therapeutics is currently uncertain.
      Because kinases have been implicated in numerous diseases and conditions, such as cancer, there is a need to develop new and potent protein kinase inhibitors that can be used for treatment. The present invention fulfills these and other needs in the art. Although certain protein kinases are specifically named herein, the present invention is not limited to inhibitors of these kinases, and, includes, within its scope, inhibitors of related protein kinases, and inhibitors of homologous proteins.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002730849,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
      The present invention relates to a pyrrolo-pyridine derivative compound, a preparation method thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition for use in preventing or treating protein kinase related disease as an active ingredient.
2. Description of the Related Art
      Protein kinase is an enzyme that catalyses the reaction to transfer the terminal phosphate group of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a specific residue of protein (tyrosine, serine, threonine), and is involved in signals that regulate cell activation, growth, and differentiation according to extracellular mediators and environmental changes.
      Inappropriately high protein kinase activity is directly or indirectly involved in various diseases resulting from abnormal cellular functions. For example, mutation, over-expression or failure of appropriate regulatory mechanism of kinases involved in inappropriate enzyme activity, or over-synthesis or deficiency of factors involved in upstream or downstream signal transduction of cytokines or kinases can cause disease. Therefore, selective inhibition of kinase activity can be a beneficial target for the development of new drugs for the treatment of disease.
      Brain cancer is a general term for primary brain cancer that occurs in the brain tissue and the cerebral meninges surrounding the brain and secondary brain cancer that has metastasized from the skull or other parts of the body. Such brain cancer is distinguished from other cancers developed in other organs in many aspects. First, cancers developed in lung, stomach and breast are limited in one or two types of cancer for each organ and their properties are the same or similar. However, many different types of cancers can be developed in the brain. For example, polymorphic glioblastoma, malignant glioma, lymphoma, blastoma, and metastatic tumor can be developed in the brain.
      Down syndrome is a disease caused by chromosome aberration, precisely caused by trisomy of human chromosome 21, which is characterized by such symptoms as mental retardation, learning disorder and memory loss, early onset of Alzheimer's disease and cranial facial disorder. In particular, it is believed that the changes in the expression levels of such genes that exist in a certain region called ‘Down syndrome critical region DSCR)’ of human chromosome 21 cause Down syndrome. DYRK1A (dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A) is a gene playing an important role in the development and function of the nerve center, and is also involved in phosphorylation of various proteins. This gene is particularly related to the symptoms like learning disorder, memory loss, synaptic flexibility change, abnormal cell cycle and neuropathological symptoms similar to Alzheimer's dementia. So, it is necessary to understand biochemical, functional and molecular biological effects of this protein for disclosing the pathogenesis of Down syndrome related diseases and for developing therapeutic agents for Down syndrome related neurodefective.
      Down syndrome is the most frequent chromosome abnormality syndrome, which is diagnosed one out of 700 new born babies. Down syndrome occurs regardless of racial, environmental and socioeconomic differences. The incidence is higher when the mother is over 35 years old. If the mother is over 40 years old, the frequency is 1 per 100 newborns. There is no way to prevent such genetic abnormality in modern medicine. It is only possible to determine whether the fetus has Down syndrome through genetic testing before birth.
      Down syndrome patients display the following common physical features. Symptoms appear in all the body, which causes behavioral development delay due to decreased brain function in children with Down syndrome. 30˜40% of down syndrome patients are born with congenital heart disease such as heart valve abnormalities and have a high incidence of pneumonia, leukemia, bowel obstruction and enteritis due to decreased immunity. Most of symptoms can be treated or prevented due to the advancement of medical technology so that the average life span of Down syndrome patients is increasing to 50 years.
      However, there have been no promising results produced so far regarding the development of a therapeutic agent for cerebral nervous system depression and neurodegenerative symptoms, and Piracetam known to improve cognitive ability has not been shown to be effective in children with Down syndrome (Lobaugh, N. J. et al. (2001). “Piracetam therapy does not enhance cognitive functioning in children with Down syndrome.” Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 155: 442-448). Therefore, it is an urgent request to develop a novel therapeutic agent based on the disclosure of the fundamental cause mechanism of cerebral nervous system abnormalities in patients with Down syndrome.
      On the other hand, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease that progresses to senile dementia. This disease can be divided into late onset developed in aged people (over 65 years old) and early onset developed in people who are at the age between and 60. The pathological aspect is equal between these two types of disease above, but when the disease is early onset, the symptoms are more severe and more prevalent.
      All the developed medicinal products including those in the course of study and development can delay the progress of Alzheimer's disease or are focused on the alleviation of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. In the recent two decades, drugs that can improve cognitive ability especially in patients in the early and intermediate stages of the disease have been developed, and these drugs have been currently used as the primary drugs to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease.
      Particularly, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AchEI) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist are the examples of those drugs to treat AD, which are still aiming to alleviate the symptoms of the disease, rather than targeting the disease pathway.
      Tacrine is the first generation acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (AchE1), which was first approved for its antidementia action. It is known that tacrine can delay the loss of cognitive function in about 30% of Alzheimer's disease patients in the early and intermediate stages by inhibiting the decomposition of acetylcholine generated in the brain. Even though tacrine has been known to delay the loss of cognitive function by inhibiting the decomposition of acetylcholine, the duration of action is short so that it has to be administered at least 4 times a day. In addition, it cannot prevent the degenerative changes of brain cells, which are the fundamental problems of Alzheimer's disease, and even worse it causes many liver related side effects, so that it is hardly used these days.
      Donepezil, as the second generation cholinesterase inhibitor (ChE1) attracting our attention these days, was developed by Eisai Co., Japan and approved by FDA, USA, in the late 1996, and thus has been sold in over 30 countries since 1997. Donepezil can be taken once a day, and is able to inhibit selectively to reduce peripheral side effects. Rivastigmine is the drug developed by Novartis Co., USA and approved in December, 1997 in Switzerland and used in EU and South American countries. This drug is being prepared for approval in USA and Canada, and was introduced in Korea in September, 1997. Rivastigmine can be taken twice a day and has significantly reduced peripheral side effects due to its high specificity to the central nervous system. Rivastigmine is reported to have little hepatotoxicity since it is metabolized in the kidney. Metrifonate is undergoing a phase 3 clinical trial in dementia patients and has been reported to have a long duration of action as an irreversible AChEI.
      The pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid plaque generated by the deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangle formed by the hyper-phosphorylation of tau protein which is functioning to stabilize microtubule.
      Plaques are produced by the excessive accumulation of beta amyloid due to the over-production or metabolic abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease patients. The loss of neurons can be caused by toxicity of beta amyloid and plaque, resulting in cognitive impairment and memory impairment.
      In the course of developing an inhibitor of the expression of DYRK1A, which is a cause of various diseases including cancer, Down syndrome, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, the present inventors confirmed that the pyrrolo-pyridine derivative compound of the present invention was able to inhibit the DYRK1A expression efficiently, leading to the completion of the present invention.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002444527,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Spider silks are nature's high-performance polymers, obtaining extraordinary toughness due to a combination of strength and elasticity. Up to seven specialized glands exist in spiders, which produce a variety of silk fiber types with different mechanical properties and functions. Dragline silk, produced by the major ampullate gland, is the toughest fiber, and on a weight basis it outperforms man-made materials, such as high tensile steel and Kevlar. The properties of dragline silk are attractive in development of new materials for medical or technical purposes.
      Dragline silk consists of two main polypeptides, mostly referred to as major ampullate spidroin (MaSp) 1 and 2, but to ADF-3 and ADF-4 in Araneus diadematus. These proteins have apparent molecular masses in the range of 200-720 kDa, depending on sample age and conditions of analysis, but no full-length dragline spider silk gene has yet been reported. The properties of dragline silk polypeptides are discussed in Huemmerich, D. et al. Novel assembly properties of recombinant spider dragline silk proteins. Curr. Biol. 14, 2070-2074 (2004). The known dragline silk spidroins are composed of highly iterated blocks of alternating alanine-rich segments, forming crystalline β-sheets in the fiber, and glycine-rich segments which are more flexible and mainly lack ordered structure. The C-terminal region is non-repetitive, highly conserved between species, and adopts α-helical conformation. The N-terminal region of dragline silk proteins has not been characterized until very recently, revealing an N-terminal domain that is highly conserved between different spidroins, and also between different spider species (Rising, A. et al. N-terminal nonrepetitive domain common to dragline, flagelliform, and cylindriform spider silk proteins. Biomacromolecules 7, 3120-3124 (2006)).
      The mechanical properties of dragline silk varies between species; Euprosthenops sp dragline silk is stiffer, stronger (requires more force to break) and less extendible than dragline silk from e.g. Araneus diadematus or Nephila clavipes. Dragline silk from Euprosthenops sp appears to have a greater proportion of crystalline β-sheet structure than dragline silk from Araneus diadematus, most likely due to that the Euprosthenops sp MaSp has the highest polyalanine content among all species analyzed so far (Pouchkina-Stantcheva, N. N. & McQueen-Mason, S. J. Molecular studies of a novel dragline silk from a nursery web spider, Euprosthenops sp. (Pisauridae). Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol 138, 371-376 (2004)).
      Attempts to produce artificial spider silks have employed natural or synthetic gene fragments encoding dragline silk proteins, since no full-length gene has yet been reported. Recombinant dragline silk proteins have been expressed in various systems including bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, plants, insect cells, transgenic silkworms and transgenic goats. See e.g. Lewis, R. V. et al. Expression and purification of a spider silk protein: a new strategy for producing repetitive proteins. Protein Expr. Purif. 7, 400-406 (1996); Fahnestock, S. R. & Irwin, S. L. Synthetic spider dragline silk proteins and their production in Escherichia coli. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 47, 23-32 (1997); Arcidiacono, S. et al. Purification and characterization of recombinant spider silk expressed in Escherichia coli. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 49, 31-38 (1998); Fahnestock, S. R. & Bedzyk, L. A. Production of synthetic spider dragline silk protein in Pichia pastoris. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 47, 33-39 (1997); and Lazaris, A. et al. Spider silk fibers spun from soluble recombinant silk produced in mammalian cells. Science 295, 472-476 (2002).
      WO 2004/016651 (The University of York) discloses nucleic acid sequences coding for internal, repetitive parts of MaSp1 proteins from Euprosthenops sp. No protein is expressed.
      Huemmerich, D. et al. Primary structure elements of spider dragline silks and their contribution to protein solubility. Biochemistry 43, 13604-13612 (2004) discloses a synthetic gene, “(AQ) 12NR3”, coding for repetitive Ala-rich and Gly/Gln-rich fragments and a non-repetitive fragment, all derived from ADF3 from Araneus. The gene is expressed into a soluble protein (59.8 kD, >528 aa), which aggregates but does not form polymers or fibers. The alanine content of the protein is 10-15%.
      WO 03/057727 discloses expression of soluble recombinant silk polypeptides in mammalian cell lines and animals. One expressed silk polypeptide (ADF-3; 60 kD, 652 aa) consists of a repetitive unit and a non-repetitive hydrophilic domain. Another expressed silk polypeptide (ADF-3 His; 63 kD, 677 aa) consists of a repetitive unit, a non-repetitive hydrophilic domain, a c-myc epitope and a six-Histidine tag. The repetitive unit has a low content of Ala (10-20%). The obtained silk polypeptides exhibit poor solubility in aqueous media and/or form precipitates. Since the obtained silk polypeptides do not polymerize spontaneously, spinning is required to obtain polymers or fibers.
      Several factors complicate the expression of dragline silk proteins. Due to the highly repetitive nature of the genes, and the concomitant restricted amino acid composition of the proteins, transcription and translation errors occur. Depletion of tRNA-pools in microbial expression systems, with subsequent discontinuous translation, leading to premature termination of protein synthesis might be another reason. Other reasons discussed for truncation of protein synthesis are secondary structure formation of the mRNA, and recombination of the genes. Native MaSp genes larger than 2.5 kb have been shown to be instable in bacterial hosts. Additionally, there are difficulties in maintaining the recombinant silk proteins in soluble form, since both natural-derived dragline silk fragments and designed block copolymers, especially MaSp1/ADF-4-derived proteins, easily self-assemble into amorphous aggregates, causing precipitation and loss of protein. See Huemmerich, D. et al. Primary structure elements of spider dragline silks and their contribution to protein solubility. Biochemistry 43, 13604-13612 (2004) and Lazaris, A. et al. Spider silk fibers spun from soluble recombinant silk produced in mammalian cells. Science 295, 472-476 (2002).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002664673,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      RdCVF is a thioredoxin-like protein specifically expressed by rod photoreceptor cells in the retina (Léveillard et al. (2004) Nature Genetics 36:755-759 and the supplemental information). Two different RdCVF genes are found in humans and they are designated RdCVF1 and RdCVF2. Both RdCVF genes encode two products via alternative splicing: a full length protein and a C-terminal post-transcriptionally truncated protein, known as RdCVF-long and RdCVF-short, respectively.
      RdCVF-short is described as a secreted trophic factor for promoting cone survival, and RdCVF-Long as a redox-active enzyme that interacts with intracellular proteins (Léveillard et al. (2010) Sci Transl Med. 2(26): 26ps16). For example, tau is described as a binding partner for RdCVF-L and tau is exclusively intracellular (Fridlich et al. (2009) Molecular & Cellular Proteomics 8(6):1206-18).
      Individuals suffering from some retinal dystrophies were found to have lower levels of RdCVF protein in their eyes than did individuals without retinal dystrophies (PCT Publication WO02/081513).
      It has been demonstrated that different forms of RdCVF protein can promote cone photoreceptor cell survival in vitro and in vivo. For example, intraocular injections of the short form of human RdCVF1 (RdCVF1S) protein not only rescued cone cells from degeneration but also preserved their function in animal models of inherited retinal degeneration (Yang et al. (2009) Mol Therapy 17:787-795). However, demonstration of the in vivo cone cell protective effect of this protein required using multiple intraocular injections.
      Expression of significant levels of RdCVF at large scale and from gene therapy vectors has been challenging, e.g., see U.S. Patent Publication No. 20110034546, paragraph [0004].

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002474582,"BACKGROUND
      This disclosure relates generally to tires, and more particularly to sensors for tires.
      Many different types of sensor devices exist for providing information about the tires of a wheeled vehicle. In order to optimize vehicle performance and minimize tire wear, it is desirable to monitor and maintain such tire characteristics as proper tire inflation and tire loading. For instance, tire over-inflation and/or under-inflation can lead to uneven tread wear, lessened grip at the tire-to-road interface, and reduced tire performance, among other things.
      Known sensors for providing such information typically are mounted to the tire in various locations, such as in the tread, sidewall, inside the tire, etc. Existing sensors tend to be complicated to operate and difficult to mount to a tire.
      For these and other reasons, there is a need for the present invention.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      In accordance with embodiments of the invention, a tire sensor system includes a first sensor a second sensor spaced apart from the first sensor. A processor receives input signals from the first and second sensors and is programmed to determine the length of a contact patch of the tire in response to the input signals.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02399619,"BACKGROUND
      The following is offered as background information only and is not admitted to be prior art to the present invention.
      Solids, including pharmaceuticals, often have more than one crystal form, and this is known as polymorphism. Polymorphism occurs when a compound crystallizes in a multiplicity of solid phases that differ in crystal packing. Numerous examples are cited in the standard references of solid state properties of pharmaceuticals, Byrn, S. R., Solid-State Chemistry of Drugs, New Your, Academic Press (1982); Kuhnert-Brandstatter, M., Thermomiscroscopy In The Analysis of Pharmaceuticals, New York, Pergamon Press (1971) and Haleblian, J. K. and McCrone, W. Pharmaceutical applications of polymorphism. J. Pharm. Sci., 58, 911 (1969). Byrn states that, in general, polymorphs exhibit different physical characteristics including solubility and physical and chemical stability.
      Because of differences in molecular packing, polymorphs may differ in ways that influence drug release, solid-state stability, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The relative stability and the interconversions of polymorphs are particularly important to the selection of a marketed drug. A suitable polymorph may hinge upon the issue of physical stability. For example, the selection of a marketed drug may depend upon the availability and selection of a suitable polymorph having desirable characteristics, such as excellent physical stability or the ability to be manufactured in large scale. The performance of the solid dosage form should not be limited by polymorphic transformations during the shelf life of the product. It is important to note that there is no reliable method to predict the observable crystal structures of a given drug or to predict the existence of polymorphs with desirable physical properties.
      PKs are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues of proteins. The consequences of this seemingly simple activity are staggering since virtually all aspects of cell life (e.g., cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation) in one way or another depend on PK activity. Furthermore, abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from relatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer).
      Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), a class of PK, are excellent candidates for molecular targeted therapy, because they play key roles in controlling cell proliferation and survival and are frequently dysregulated in a variety of malignancies. The mechanisms of dysregulation include overexpression (Her2/neu in breast cancer, epidermal growth factor receptor in non-small cell lung cancer), activating mutations (KIT in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, fms-related tyrosine kinase 3/Flk2 (FLT3) in acute myelogenous leukemia), and autocrine loops of activation (vascular endothelial growth factor/VEGF receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) in melanoma, platelet-derived growth factor/PDGF receptor (PDGF/PDGFR) in sarcoma).
      Aberrantly regulated RTKs have been described in comparable human and canine cancers. For example, aberrant expression of the Met oncogene occurs in both human and canine osteosarcoma. Interestingly, comparable activating mutations in the juxtamembrane (JM) domain of c-kit are seen in 50-90% of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and in 30-50% of advanced canine MCTs (mast cell tumors). Although the mutations in human GISTs consist of deletions in the JM domain and those in canine MCTs consist of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the JM domain, both lead to constitutive phosphorylation of KIT in the absence of ligand binding. The RTKs and their ligands, VEGF, PDGF, and FGF mediate neo-vascularization, known as angiogenesis, in solid tumors. Consequently, by inhibiting the RTKs, the growth of new blood vessels into tumors may be inhibited.
      Antiangiogenesis agents, a class of molecules that inhibits the growth of blood vessels into tumors, have much less toxicity to the body compared to conventional anti-cancer drugs. U.S. Pat. No. 6,573,293, incorporated herein by reference, discloses, among other compounds, 5-[5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-indol-(3Z)-ylidenemethyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethyl)-amide (hereinafter “Compound I”). It has the following structure:

( MOL) ( CDX)
      Compound I is a small molecule that exhibits PK modulating ability. The compound is therefore useful in treating disorders related to abnormal PK activity. It is an inhibitor of the RTKs, PDGFR, VEGFR, KIT, and FLT3. Compound I has been shown to inhibit KIT phosphorylation, arrest cell proliferation, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in malignant mast cell lines in vitro expressing various forms of mutant KIT. Compound I and related molecules are effective in preclinical models against tumor xenografts arising from cell lines of diverse human tumor origin.
      Compound I is useful for treating cancers in companion animals, mainly dogs, and is also useful for the treatment of, inter alia, cancer in humans. Such cancers include, but are not limited to, leukemia, brain cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, astrocytoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, glioblastoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancer, small-cell lung cancer, glioma, colorectal cancer, genitourinary cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal cancer. Also, Compound I is useful for the treatment of diseases related to overexpression of mast cells, including but not limited to, mastocytosis in humans and mast cell tumors in dogs.
      Compound I was recently shown to be clinically effective against a number of spontaneous malignancies in dogs. In the study, 11 of 22 canine MCTs showed durable objective responses (partial responses and complete responses) to Compound I treatment; 9 of these MCTs possessed ITDs in the JM domain of c-kit.
      Compound I readily crystallizes. Its solubility is about 10 μg/1 mL in pH 6 phosphate buffer at 25° C. When the compound was synthesized, very fine particles precipitated out of solution during the last step of synthesis. Subsequent isolation of these fine particles by filtration was slow, and a hard cake resulted after filtration. There is a need for a salt of Compound I which has physical stability and desirable physical properties.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002605900,"BACKGROUND
      Many proteins require glycosylation for their biological function. Often, the terminal, “capping,” carbohydrates of glycosylic chains are sialic acid residues. Sialic acids comprise a family of N- and O-linked neuraminic acids. N-linked sialic acids are formed by linking acetyl or glycolyl moieties to the amino residue of neuraminic acid, forming N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), respectively. If the amino group of neuraminic is substituted with a hydroxyl moiety, this yields 3-deoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulosonic acid (KDN). O-linked sialic acids are formed by the substitutions of one or more of the hydroxyl groups of Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, or KDN with methyl, acetyl, lactoyl, sulfate, or phosphate groups. Accordingly, a large and diverse population of sialic acids exists.
      Further, there is considerable interest in analyzing protein sialylation, in general, because of the numerous biological functions attributed to these modifications. Sialylation can be important for the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of protein biotherapeutics. Consequently, several analytical methods have been developed to evaluate the sialic acid content of glycoproteins. For example, antibody-based assays can be used to identify particular carbohydrate moieties.
      Terminal sialic acid resides can be enzymatically detached from the glycoprotein of interest and analyzed by HPLC. However, each of these methods has shortcomings and typically requires pure samples or high concentrations. Conventional methods used by the biopharmaceutical industry suffer from poor accuracy, high data variability, and they cannot be used with complex culture media due to matrix interference. The method described herein overcomes such shortcomings and provides accurate and reproducible quantitation of protein sialylation.
      Collectively, the method described herein comprises two steps: (1) an enzymatic reaction is used to hydrolyze the galactose and sialic acid residues from the glycoproteins; and (2) an ion-exchange chromatography method is used to separate and quantify the galactose residues. The enzymatic portion of the method involves the release of exposed (uncapped) terminal galactose residues by the specific exo-glycosidase, β-(1-4)-galactosidase (β-galactosidase), while the terminal sialic acid residues are released by α-(2-3,6,8,9)-sialidase (α-sialidase). Prior to digestion, a sample is divided among at least three tubes. The first tube, Reaction A, is a background sample, and comprises the enzyme reaction buffers only. The second tube, Reaction B, is reacted with β-galactosidase that cleaves all galactose residues that are not capped by sialic acids. The third tube, Reaction C, is co-digested with both neuraminidase and β-galactosidase. The neuraminidase enzyme removes the capping sialic acids and permits β-galactosidase to cleave all of the exposed galactose residues. High Performance Anion-exchange chromatography with Pulsed Amperometric Detection (HPAEC PAD) is then used to determine the amount of galactose present in the three samples. The ratio of uncapped galactose (i.e., Reaction B) to total galactose (i.e., Reaction C) is used to calculate percent capping of galactose residues, while also accounting for any free galactose present in the media (Reaction A).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002636459,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Mycoplasma spp. is currently known the tiniest bacteria capable of self-replication outside host cells. Although swine enzootic pneumonia would not cause swine death, it will reduce feeding efficiency and cause growth retardation, inflammation, and immunosuppression as well as make swine more vulnerable to infection of other pathogens, which therefore become economic damage of the industry.
      So far, swine enzootic pneumonia is prevented by three major strategies, including: medicine administration, environment management, and vaccination. Seeing the bad prevention efficiency of antibiotics to Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, medicine administration can only used for treatment purposes and is hard to meet prevention needs. Furthermore, considering that drug abuse may lead to a larger infection causing by drug-resistant bacteria, medicine administration needs cautious plans and exists a lot of limitations.
      Environment management forms the basis of prevention of Mycoplasma spp. infection. Good piggery sanitation and management would be helpful to reduce occurrence of infection. On the other hand, prevention could be more comprehensive through vaccination.
      The conventional vaccines in the field use inactive/dead bacteria as the active ingredient thereof. However, the price of the conventional vaccines is too high because Mycoplasma spp. is fastidious bacteria and is difficult to be cultured in the laboratory. In order to reduce the cost of Mycoplasma spp. vaccines, scientists continuously try to develop vaccines of different types, such as: (1) attenuated vaccines, (2) vector vaccines, (3) subunit vaccines, and (4) DNA vaccines. Among them, subunit vaccines show the most potential because the advantages of ease in production and high safety.
      To date, there are several potential candidate proteins that could be used for M. hyopneumoniae vaccines; however, there is no further report verifying the proteins suitable for M. hyopneumoniae vaccines.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02345137,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Labeling of a protein, cell, or organism of interest plays a prominent role in many biochemical, molecular biological and medical diagnostic applications. A variety of different labels have been developed and used in the art, including radiolabels, chromolabels, fluorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels, and the like, with varying properties and optimal uses. However, there is continued interest in the development of new labels. Of particular interest is the development of new protein labels, including fluorescent protein labels. Fluorescent proteins or fluoroprotein are proteins that exhibit low, medium or intense fluorescence upon irradiation with light of the appropriate excitation wavelength. The fluorescent characteristic of these proteins is one that arises from the interaction of two or more amino acid residues of the protein, and not from a single amino acid residue. As such, the fluorescent proteins do not include proteins that exhibit fluorescence only from residues that act by themselves as intrinsic fluors, i.e., tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine. As used herein, the term “fluorescent protein” does not include luciferases, such as Renilla luciferase.
      Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), its mutants and homologs are widely known today due to their intensive use as in vivo fluorescent markers in biomedical sciences discussed in detail by Lippincott-Schwartz and Patterson in Science (2003) 300(5616):87-91). The GFP from hydromedusa Aequorea aequorea (synonym A. victoria), discovered by Johnson et al. in J Cell Comp Physiol. (1962), 60:85-104, was found as a part of bioluminescent system of the jellyfish where GFP played role of a secondary emitter transforming blue light from photoprotein aequorin into green light cDNA encoding A. victoria GFP was cloned by Prasher et al. (Gene (1992), 111(2):229-33). It turned out, that this gene can be heterologically expressed in practically any organism due to unique ability of GFP to form fluorophore by itself (Chalfie et al., Science 263 (1994), 802-805). This finding opens broad perspectives for use of GFP in cell biology as a genetically encoded fluorescent label.
      The GFP was applied for wide range of applications including the study of gene expression and protein localization (Chalfie et al., Science 263 (1994), 802-805, and Heim et al. in Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (1994), 91: 12501-12504), as a tool for visualizing subcellular organelles in cells (Rizzuto et al., Curr. Biology (1995), 5: 635-642), for the visualization of protein transport along the secretory pathway (Kaether and Gerdes, FEBS Letters (1995), 369: 267-271).
      A great deal of research is being performed to improve the properties of GFP and to produce GFP reagents useful and optimized for a variety of research purposes. New versions of GFP have been developed, such as a “humanized” GFP DNA, the protein product of which has increased synthesis in mammalian cells (Haas, et al., Current Biology (1996), 6: 315-324; Yang, et al., Nucleic Acids Research (1996), 24: 4592-4593). One such humanized protein is “enhanced green fluorescent protein” (EGFP) mutant variant of GFP having two amino acid substitutions: F64L and S65T (Heim et al., Nature 373 (1995), 663-664). Other mutations to GFP have resulted in blue-, cyan- and yellow-green light emitting versions.
      Despite the great utility of GFP, however, other fluorescent proteins with properties similar to or different from GFP would be useful in the art. In particular, benefits of novel fluorescent proteins include fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) possibilities based on new spectra and better suitability for larger excitation. In 1999, GFP homologs were cloned from non-bioluminescent Anthozoa species (Matz et al., Nature Biotechnol. (1999),17: 969-973). This discovery demonstrated that these proteins are not necessary component of bioluminescence machinery. Anthozoa-derived GFP-like proteins showed great spectral diversity including cyan, green, yellow, red fluorescent proteins and purple-blue non-fluorescent chromoproteins (CPs) (Matz et al., Bioessays (2002), 24(10):953-959). Afterwards, cDNA of GFP homologs were cloned from several Hydroid medusae, including Aequorea macrodactyla (GenBank accession numbers AF435427-AF435433) and Aequorea coerulescens (Gurskaya et al., Biochem J. (2003), 373(Pt 2): 403-408). Thus far, the 40-years history of GFP research revealed GFP-like proteins only within two Cnidaria classes Hydrozoa and Anthozoa.
      The utility of fluorescent proteins as a tool in molecular biology has prompted the search for other fluorescent proteins with different and improved properties, as compared to known fluorescent proteins. Thus, it is an object to provide novel fluorescent proteins that exhibit properties not currently available in the limited number of known fluorescent proteins as well as DNAs encoding them that do not suffer from the drawbacks of the known GFP.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02372401,"BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
       Bleeding is a common clinical problem. It is a consequence of disease, trauma, surgery and medicinal treatment. It is imperative to mechanically stop the bleeding. This may be difficult or even impossible due to the location of the bleeding or because it diffuses from many (small) vessels. Patients who are bleeding may thus require treatment with agents that support haemostasis. This may be blood-derived products (haemotherapy), agents that cause the release of endogenous haemostatic agents, recombinant coagulation factors (F), or agents that delay the dissolution of blood clots.
       The first line treatment among the blood derived products, often obtained from the local hospital, are whole blood for volume substitution and support of haemostasis, packed red cells for the improvement of oxygen transporting capacity, platelet concentrates to raise the number of platelets (if low or defective) and fresh frozen plasma for support of the haemostasis (blood coagulation and platelet aggregation). Second line plasma derived products that support haemostasis are plasma cryoprecipitate, prothrombin complex concentrates, activated prothrombin complex concentrates and purified coagulation factors. Several coagulation factors are today available as human recombinant proteins, inactive (coagulation factors VIII and IX) and activated (coagulation factor VIIa).
       Haemophilia is an inherited or acquired bleeding disorder with either abnormal or deficient coagulation factor or antibodies directed towards a coagulation factor which inhibits the procoagulant function. The most common haemophilias are haemophilia A (lack coagulation factor VIII) and haemophilia B (factor IX). The purified or recombinant single coagulation factors are the main treatment of patients with haemophilia. Patients with inhibitory antibodies posses a treatment problem as they may also neutralise the coagulation factor that is administered to the patient. The active form of Protein C (APC) is an inhibitor of plasma coagulation by degradation of the activated coagulation factors Va and VIIIa. Recombinant APC has been shown to be an effective treatment of undue plasma coagulation in patients with sepsis.
       Coagulation factors for therapeutic use can be obtained from human plasma, although the purification process is not simple and requires many steps of which several aim at eliminating contaminating viruses. But even with extensive safety measures and testing of blood-derived products, contamination with infectious viruses or prions cannot be ruled out. Because of this risk it is highly desirable to produce human therapeutic proteins from recombinant cells grown in media without animal derived components. This is not always straightforward as many proteins require a mammalian host to be produced in a fully functional form, i.e. be correctly post-translationally modified. Among the coagulation factors commercially produced in recombinant cells are FVII (NovoSeven), FVIII (Kogenate, Recombinate, Refacto) and FIX (BeneFix) (Roddie and Ludlam. Blood Rev. 11: 169-177, 1997) and Active Protein C (Xigris). One of the major obstacles in obtaining large amounts of fully functional recombinant human coagulation factors lies in the Gla-domain present in FII, FVII, FIX, FX and Protein C. This domain contains glutamic acid residues that are post-translationally modified by addition of carboxyl groups. The production of these factors are hampered by the fact that over-expression of them result in under-carboxylated, and hence inactive, protein. The Gla modifications are a result of the action of a vitamin K-dependent enzyme called γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX). This enzyme has been extensively studied by many scientists, particularly those involved in coagulation factor research (WO-A-8803926; Wu et al. Science 254(5038): 1634-1636, 1991; Rehemtulla et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 4611-4615, 1993; Stanley J. Biol. Chem. 274(24): 16940-16944, 1999; Vo et al., FEBS letters 445: 256-260, 1999; Begley et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 275(46): 36245-36249, 2000; Walker et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 276(11): 7769-7774, 2001; Bandyopadhyay, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99(3): 1264-1269, 2002; Czerwiec et al., Eur J Biochem 269: 6162-6172, 2002; Hallgren et al., Biochemistry 41(50): 15045-15055, 2002; Harvey et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry 278(10): 8363-8369, 2003). Attempts to increase yields by co-expressing GGCX with coagulation factor FIX has been tried by at least two scientific groups but were not successful (Rehemtulla, et al. 1993, ibid; Hallgren et al. 2002, ibid). Considering the large interest in γ-carboxylated proteins, it may be assumed that many more co-expression trials have failed and thus have not been reported.
       For human FII (prothrombin) at least 8 out of 10 Glu residues have to be correctly modified in order to obtain fully functional prothrombin (Malhotra, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260: 279-287, 1985; Seegers and Walz ‘Prothrombin and other vitamin K proteins’, CRC Press, 1986). Extensive efforts to obtain high production levels of rhFII have been made using several different systems such as CHO cells, BHK cells, 293 cells and vaccinia virus expression systems, but have all failed or resulted in an under-carboxylated product and thus functionally inactive prothrombin (Jørgensen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262: 6729-6734, 1987; Russo et al., Biotechnol Appl Biochem 14(2): 222-233, 1991; Fischer et al., J Biotechnol 38(2): 129-136, 1995; Herlitschka et al. Protein Expr. Purif. 8(3): 358-364, 1996; Russo et al., Protein Expr. Purif. 10: 214-225, 1997; Vo et al. 1999, ibid; Wu and Suttie Thromb Res 96(2): 91-98, 1999). Earlier reported productivities for carboxylated recombinant human prothrombin are low; 20 mg/L for mutant prothrombin (Cote et al., J. Biol. Chem 269: 11374-11380, 1994), 0.55 mg/L for human prothrombin expressed in CHO cells (fully carboxylated, Jørgensen et al. 1987, ibid), 25 mg/L in CHO cells (degree of carboxylation not shown, Russo et al. 1997, ibid).
       WO 92/19636 discloses the cloning and sequence identification of a human and bovine vitamin K dependent carboxylase. The application suggests co-expressing the vitamin K dependent carboxylase and a vitamin K dependent protein in a suitable host cell in order to prepare the vitamin K dependent protein. No co-expression of the carboxylase and vitamin K dependent protein is exemplified.
       There is a need for improved methods to produce activated blood clotting factors in high yields. The present invention sets out to address this need.

0002662977,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Raw milk contains in addition to water (about 87%), fat (about 4.5%), lactose (about 5%) and protein (about 3.3%) also minerals and trace elements, such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, manganese, potassium, sodium, iodine and zinc. Further, milk contains also vitamins, such as A, K, B12, B6 and B2. The amino acid composition of milk proteins has better biological value than any other protein (red or white meat). Milk proteins contain a lot of so-called essential amino acids like lysine, leucine and isoleucine. The proteins of milk belong to casein or whey proteins. Typically the ratio of casein protein to whey protein in cow's milk is about 80:20. The major whey proteins in milk are beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin having molecular sizes of 14-18 kDa. Casein make up about 80% of the proteins in cow milk and are divided into alpha-, beta- and kappa-caseins. The molecular sizes of caseins are in the range of 19-23 kDa. In milk, casein exists in groups of molecules that are called micelles. These particles/micelles consist of casein, calcium, inorganic phosphate and citrate ions. In one casein particle there are about 20 000 single casein protein molecules. Casein particle has a porous structure containing water about 3 g per 1 g of casein.
      Amino acids of animal- and plant-based proteins may be cross-linked by enzymes, such as transglutaminase, laccase, tyrosinase, peroxidase, sulfhydryl oxidase and protein glutaminase in a known manner. The transglutaminase enzyme (EC 2.3.2.13) catalyzes the generation of covalent linkages between the glutamine and lysine amino acid residues present in the protein molecules. When linkages are formed, ammonia is released. The enzyme was first used in Japan in the manufacture of surimi (seafish paste) products (Kuraishi, et. al., Food Rev. Int. 17(2), 2001, pp. 221 to 246). Covalent bonds formed in the enzyme treatment withstand different process conditions, such as heating and mixing, well. From milk proteins, caseins and particularly the κ-caseins, are the best substrate for transglutaminase. β-casein is also rich in glutamine and lysine, which are linked together by transglutaminase.
      It is known that milk contains substances that inhibit the activity of transglutaminase. These inhibiting substances are deactivated in a heat treatment of milk. On the other hand, it is known that the content of said substances in relation to the total content of proteins and fat is reduced in ultrafiltration of milk.
      Meat analogs based on plant proteins, especially soy proteins are commercially available. In recent years methods for preparing meat analogs from milk and egg proteins in addition to plant proteins have been developed and such processes are described in the patent publications EP 1467628 B1, EP 1588626 B1, EP 1643850 B1 and EP 1772060 B1, for example.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200702209,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The essence of adaptive immunity is the ability of an organism to react to the presence of foreign substances and produce components (antibodies and cells) capable of specifically interacting with and protecting the host from their invasion. An “antigen” or “immunogen” is a substance that is able to elicit this type of immune response and also is capable of interacting with the sensitized cells and antibodies that are manufactured against it.
      Antigens or immunogens are usually macromolecules that contain distinct antigenic sites or “epitopes” that are recognized and interact with the various components of the immune system. They can exist as individual molecules composed of synthetic organic chemicals, proteins, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, RNA, DNA, or polysaccharides, or they may be parts of cellular structures (bacteria or fungi) or viruses (Harlow and Lane 1988a, b, c; Male et al., 1987).
      Small molecules like short peptides, although normally able to interact with the products of an immune response, often cannot cause a response on their own. These peptide immunogens or “haptens” as they are also called, are actually incomplete antigens, and, although not able by themselves to cause immunogenicity or to elicit antibody production, can be made immunogenic by coupling them to a suitable carrier. Carriers typically are protein antigens of higher molecular weight that are able to cause an immunological response when administered in vivo.
      In an immune response, antibodies are produced and secreted by the B-lymphocytes in conjunction with the T-helper (T H) cells. In the majority of hapten-carrier systems, the B cells produce antibodies that are specific for both the hapten and the carrier. In these cases, the T lymphocytes will have specific binding domains on the carrier, but will not recognize the hapten alone. In a kind of synergism, the B and T cells cooperate to induce a hapten-specific antibody response. After such an immune response has taken place, if the host is subsequently challenged with only the hapten, usually it will respond by producing hapten-specific antibodies from memory cells formed after the initial immunization.
      Synthetic haptens mimicking some critical epitopic structures on larger macromolecules are often conjugated to carriers to create an immune response to the larger “parent” molecule. For instance, short peptide segments can be synthesized from the known sequence of a protein and coupled to a carrier to induce immunogenicity toward the native protein. This type of synthetic approach to the immunogen production has become the basis of much of the current research into the creation of vaccines. However, in many instances, merely creating a B-cell response by using synthetic peptide-carrier conjugates, however well designed, will not always guarantee complete protective immunity toward an intact antigen. The immune response generated by a short peptide epitope from a larger viral particle or bacterial cell may only be sufficient to generate memory at the B cell level. In these cases it is generally now accepted that a cytotoxic T-cell response is a more important indicator of protective immunity. Designing peptide immunogens with the proper epitopic binding sites for both B-cell and T-cell recognition is one of the most challenging research areas in immunology today.
      The approach to increasing immunogenicity of small or poorly immunogenic molecules by conjugating these molecules to large “carrier” molecules has been utilized successfully for decades (see, e.g., Goebel et al. (1939) J. Exp. Med. 69: 53). For example, many immunogenic compositions have been described in which purified capsular polymers have been conjugated to carrier proteins to create more effective immunogenic compositions by exploiting this “carrier effect.” Schneerson et al. (1984) Infect. Immun. 45: 582-591). Conjugation has also been shown to bypass the poor antibody response usually observed in infants when immunized with a free polysaccharide (Anderson et al. (1985) J. Pediatr. 107: 346; Insel et al. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 158: 294).
      Hapten-carrier conjugates have been successfully generated using various cross-linking/coupling reagents such as homobifunctional, heterobifunctional, or zero-length cross linkers. Many such methods are currently available for coupling of saccharides, proteins, and peptides to peptide carriers. Most methods create amine, amide, urethane, isothiourea, or disulfide bonds, or in some cases thioethers. A disadvantage to the use of coupling reagents, which introduce reactive sites in to the side chains of reactive amino acid molecules on carrier and/or hapten molecules, is that the reactive sites if not neutralized are free to react with any unwanted molecule either in vitro (thus adversely affecting the functionality or stability of the conjugate(s)) or in vivo (thus posing a potential risk of adverse events in persons or animals immunized with the preparations). Such excess reactive sites can be reacted or “capped”, so as to inactivate these sites, utilizing various known chemical reactions, but these reactions may be otherwise disruptive to the functionality of the conjugates. This may be particularly problematic when attempting to create a conjugate by introducing the reactive sites into the carrier molecule, as its larger size and more complex structure (relative to the hapten) may render it more vulnerable to the disruptive effects of chemical treatment. In fact, no examples are known of methods whereby a conjugate is made by first activating the carrier, then reacting with the hapten in a conjugation reaction, and finally “capping” the remaining reactive sites, while preserving the ability of the resulting conjugate to function as an immunogenic composition having the desired properties of the “carrier effect”.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200601168,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The essence of adaptive immunity is the ability of an organism to react to the presence of foreign substances and produce components (antibodies and cells) capable of specifically interacting with and protecting the host from their invasion. An “antigen” or “immunogen” is a substance that is able to elicit this type of immune response and also is capable of interacting with the sensitized cells and antibodies that are manufactured against it.
      Antigens or immunogens are usually macromolecules that contain distinct antigenic sites or “epitopes” that are recognized and interact with the various components of the immune system. They can exist as individual molecules composed of synthetic organic chemicals, proteins, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, RNA, DNA, or polysaccharides, or they may be parts of cellular structures (bacteria or fungi) or viruses (Harlow and Lane 1988a, b, c; Male et al., 1987).
      Small molecules like short peptides, although normally able to interact with the products of an immune response, often cannot cause a response on their own. These peptide immunogens or “haptens” as they are also called, are actually incomplete antigens, and, although not able by themselves to cause immunogenicity or to elicit antibody production, can be made immunogenic by coupling them to a suitable carrier. Carriers typically are protein antigens of higher molecular weight that are able to cause an immunological response when administered in vivo.
      In an immune response, antibodies are produced and secreted by the B-lymphocytes in conjunction with the T-helper (T H) cells. In the majority of hapten-carrier systems, the B cells produce antibodies that are specific for both the hapten and the carrier. In these cases, the T lymphocytes will have specific binding domains on the carrier, but will not recognize the hapten alone. In a kind of synergism, the B and T cells cooperate to induce a hapten-specific antibody response. After such an immune response has taken place, if the host is subsequently challenged with only the hapten, usually it will respond by producing hapten-specific antibodies from memory cells formed after the initial immunization.

For instance, short peptide segments can be synthesized from the known sequence of a protein and coupled to a carrier to induce immunogenicity toward the native protein.

However, in many instances, merely creating a B-cell response by using synthetic peptide-carrier conjugates, however well designed, will not always guarantee complete protective immunity toward an intact antigen. The immune response generated by a short peptide epitope from a larger viral particle or bacterial cell may only be sufficient to generate memory at the B cell level. In these cases it is generally now accepted that a cytotoxic T-cell response is a more important indicator of protective immunity. Designing peptide immunogens with the proper epitopic binding sites for both B-cell and T-cell recognition is one of the most challenging research areas in immunology today.

(1985) J. Pediatr. 107: 346; Insel et al. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 158: 294).
      Hapten-carrier conjugates have been successfully generated using various cross-linking/coupling reagents such as homobifunctional, heterobifunctional, or zero-length cross linkers. Many such methods are currently available for coupling of saccharides, proteins, and peptides to peptide carriers. Most methods create amine, amide, urethane, isothiourea, or disulfide bonds, or in some cases thioethers.

Such excess reactive sites can be reacted or “capped”, so as to inactivate these sites, utilizing various known chemical reactions, but these reactions may be otherwise disruptive to the functionality of the conjugates. This may be particularly problematic when attempting to create a conjugate by introducing the reactive sites into the carrier molecule, as its larger size and more complex structure (relative to the hapten) may render it more vulnerable to the disruptive effects of chemical treatment.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002439076,"BACKGROUND
      Many therapeutically relevant recombinant proteins are produced in a variety of host organisms. Most proteins can be expressed in their native form in eukaryotic hosts such as CHO cells. Animal cell culture generally requires prolonged growing times to achieve maximum cell density and ultimately achieves lower cell density than prokaryotic cell cultures (Cleland, J. (1993) ACS Symposium Series 526, Protein Folding: In Vivo and In Vitro, American Chemical Society). Additionally, animal cell cultures often require expensive media containing growth components that may interfere with the recovery of the desired protein. Bacterial host expression systems provide a cost-effective alternative to the manufacturing scale production of recombinant proteins. Numerous U.S. patents on general bacterial expression of recombinant proteins exist, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,565,785; 4,673,641; 4,795,706; and 4,710,473. A major advantage of the production method is the ability to easily isolate the product from the cellular components by centrifugation or microfiltration. See, e.g., Kipriyanov and Little, (1999) Molecular Biotechnology, 12: 173-201; and, Skerra and Pluckthun, (1988) Science, 240: 1038-1040.
      However, bacterial expression systems such as E. coli lack the cellular machinery to facilitate proper refolding of the proteins and generally do not result in the secretion of large proteins into the culture media. Recombinant proteins expressed in bacterial host cells are often found as inclusion bodies consisting of dense masses of partially folded and misfolded reduced protein. See, e.g., Baneyx, (1999) Current Opin. Biotechnology 10:411-421; and, Villaverde and Carrio, (2003) Biotech. Letts. 25:1385-1395. Proteins may also be expressed without forming inclusion bodies. See, e.g., Id. Typically in inclusion bodies, the recombinant protein is generally inactive.
      Additionally, refolding often produces misfolded and disulfide-linked dimers, trimers, and multimers. (Morris et al., (1990) Biochem. J., 268:803-806; Toren et al., (1988) Anal. Biochem., 169:287-299). This association phenomenon is very common during protein refolding, particularly at higher protein concentrations, and appears often to involve association through hydrophobic interaction of partially folded intermediates (Cleland and Wang, (1990) Biochemistry, 29:11072-11078).
      Misfolding occurs either in the cell during fermentation or during the isolation procedure. Proteins recovered from periplasmic or intracellular space must be solubilized and the soluble protein refolded into the native state. See, e.g., Rudolph, Renaturation of Recombinant, Disulfide- Bonded Proteins From “Inclusion Bodies” in Modern Methods in Protein- and Nucleic Acid Research (Walter de Gruyter New York, 1990) pp. 149-172. In vitro methods for refolding the proteins into the correct, biologically active conformation are essential for obtaining functional proteins. Typical downstream processing of proteins recovered from inclusion bodies includes the dissolution of the inclusion body at high concentration of a denaturant such as urea followed by dilution of the denaturant to permit refolding to occur (see, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,512,922; 4,511,502; and 4,511,503). See also, e.g., Rudolph and Lilie, (1996) FASEB J. 10:49-56; Fischer et al., (1993), Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 41:3-13; Misawa & Kumagai, (1999) Biopolymers 51:297-307; and, Clark, (1998) Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 9:157-163; and, Tsumoto et al., (2003) Protein Expression and Purification 28:1-8. Such recovery methods are regarded as being universally applicable, with minor modifications, to the recovery of biologically active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. These methods have been applied to heparin binding protein (HBP) such as VEGF (Siemeister et al. (1996) supra). These methods seek to eliminate random disulfide bonding prior to coaxing the recombinant protein into its biologically active conformation through its other stabilizing forces and may not eliminate improperly folded intermediates, provide homogenous populations of properly folded product, or provide sufficient amounts of the properly folded product.
      Reversed micelles or ion exchange chromatography have been used to assist refolding of denatured proteins by enclosing a single protein within micelles or isolating them on a resin and then removing the denaturant (Hagen et al., (1990) Biotechnol. Bioeng. 35:966-975; Creighton (1985) in Protein Structure Folding and Design (Oxender, D. L. Ed.) pp.249-251, New York: Alan R. Liss, Inc.). These methods have been useful in preventing protein aggregation and facilitating proper refolding. To alter the rate or extent of refolding, conformation-specific refolding has been performed with ligands and antibodies to the native structure of the protein (Cleland and Wang, (1993), in Biotechnology, (Rehm H.-J., and Reed G. Eds.) pp 528-555, New York, VCH). For example, creatine kinase was refolded in the presence of antibodies to the native structure (Morris et al., (1987) Biochem. J. 248:53-57). In addition to antibodies, ligands and cofactors have been used to enhance refolding. These molecules would be more likely to interact with the folding protein after formation of the native protein. Therefore, the folding equilibrium could be “driven” to the native state. For example, the rate of refolding of ferricytochrome c was enhanced by the extrinsic ligand for the axial position of the heme iron (Brems and Stellwagon, (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258:3655-3661). Chaperone proteins and folding catalysts have also been used to assist with protein folding. See, e.g., Baneyx, (1999) Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 10:411-421; & Carrio & Villaverde, (2003) FEBS Letters 537:215-221. However, these methods are not always efficient or sufficient to produce quantities of protein product.
      There is a need for new and more effective methods of folding and/or recovering recombinant proteins from a host cell culture, e.g., for the efficient and economical production of recombinant proteins in bacterial cell culture. These new and more effective methods provide for improved recovery of a highly purified biologically active properly refolded protein and that are generally applicable to manufacturing scale production of the proteins. The invention addresses these and other needs, as will be apparent upon review of the following disclosure.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The invention provides a method for recovering and purifying refolded recombinant proteins from cell culture. In particular the invention provides a method of recovering a recombinant protein from prokaryotic host cells, e.g., bacterial cells. The processes of the invention are broadly applicable to recombinant proteins. In certain embodiments, the recombinant protein is a growth factor, e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In one embodiment, the growth factor is VEGF 165.
      In one embodiment, a process includes: (a) isolating said recombinant protein from the prokaryotic cell culture; (b) solubilizing said protein in a first buffered solution, pH greater than 9, comprising a first chaotropic agent; (c) refolding said solubilized protein in a second buffered solution, pH>9 but ≦11, comprising a second chaotropic agent, two or more reducing agents and addition of air or oxygen for such a time and under such conditions that refolding of the recombinant protein occurs; and (d) recovering said refolded recombinant protein. In one embodiment, the first buffered solution and/or the second buffered solution further comprises arginine. In one embodiment, the first buffered solution comprises 1 M Urea, 300 mM arginine, 10 mM CHES, 5 mM EDTA, pH 11, final concentration. In another embodiment, the first buffered solution comprises 1 M Urea, 300 mM arginine, 10 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 11, final concentration.

In another embodiment, the second buffered solution comprises 1 M Urea, 15 mM cysteine, 0.5-2 mM DTT, 100 mM arginine, 10 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 10, final concentration.
      In one embodiment, a process includes: (a) isolating said recombinant protein from the prokaryotic cell culture; (b) solubilizing and refolding said protein in a combo buffered solution, pH>9 but ≦11 with the addition of air or oxygen; and, (c) recovering said recombinant protein. In one embodiment, the combo buffered solution comprises 1 M Urea, 15 mM cysteine, 2 mM DTT, 100 mM arginine, 10 mM CHES, 5 mM EDTA, pH 10, final concentration. In another embodiment, the combo buffered solution comprises 1 M Urea, 15 mM cysteine, 0.5-2 mM DTT, 100 mM arginine, 10 mM TRIS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 10, final concentration.
      The oxygen or air for the refold reaction can be provided by an air source or an oxygen enriched compressed gas supply. In one embodiment, a k La of 0.004 min −1 is used, e.g., which represents a mixing rate of 200-400 rpm and sparging rate of 0.3 cc/min/L in a 2.5L vessel containing a marine type impeller. In other embodiments, k Lz=0.01 min −1 or 0.1 min −1 are used to produce refolded protein.
      The solubilization and/or refolding can be done at a variety of temperatures. In one embodiment, the incubation temperature for the solubilization and/or refolding is room temperature. The incubation time can vary according to the recombinant protein being recovered and refolded. In one embodiment, the recombinant protein is incubated in the first buffered solution for at least 1 hour, or 1 to 2 hours. In one embodiment, the solubilized protein is incubated in the second buffered solution for about 3 to 24 hours. In one embodiment, the isolated recombinant protein is incubated in the combo buffered solution for 3 to 24 hours.
      The invention additionally provides processes and methods for refolding of recombinant proteins either alone or in connection with the recovery of the recombinant protein as described herein. In a particular embodiment, purification methods include clarifying the solution containing the recombinant protein and contacting said refolded recombinant protein in the clarified solution with a mixed mode support, a cationic chromatographic support, a first hydrophobic interaction chromatographic support, and optionally, a second hydrophobic chromatographic support or an ion exchange support; and selectively recovering or eluting the refolded recombinant protein from each support. In one embodiment, clarifying the solution comprises adding detergent to a final concentration of 1%, adjusting pH to about 8.5-9.5, incubating solution for 1 to 10 hours at 25-30° C., centrifuging the solution; and filtering the liquid recovered from the centrifugation step. In one embodiment, the pH is about 8.7. In another embodiment, the pH is about 9.0. It is contemplated that the steps for recovery steps can be performed in any order, e.g., sequentially or altering the order of the chromatographic supports. In certain embodiments of the invention, methods are provided for recovering and purifying refolded recombinant proteins from manufacturing or industrial scale cell culture.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002624029,"BACKGROUND ART
      Cancer is the leading cause of death. Current therapies for cancer comprise combinations of principal surgical therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Furthermore, the current therapies comprise applying a similar therapy to all patients having the same type and the same stage of a cancer. At least 40% of the patients fail a primary therapy and thus are subjected to a series of further therapies. If the patients again fail the therapies, cancer metastasis takes place, finally resulting in an increased possibility of death. Thus, the current radiation therapy and the chemotherapy are unable to compatible with various types of cancers or individual cancer patients, and the surgical therapy itself is also currently insufficient for complete cure of cancers in almost all cases.
      Various antibody drugs targeting antigen proteins on cancer cells for treatment of cancers have appeared throughout the world as a technique for overcoming the above-described problems of cancer therapies. Specific examples are as follows. It has been demonstrated that HERCEPTIN (registered trademark) comprising as an active ingredient a monoclonal antibody specifically binding to Her2, the sales of which were approved in 1998 as a therapeutic agent for patients with metastatic breast cancer, has such a clinical effect that HERCEPTIN can decrease the number of death of recurrent and metastatic breast cancer patients among Her2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer patients. It has also been demonstrated that HERCEPTIN does not cause any severe side effects other than cardiac toxicity compared with conventional chemotherapeutics. As another noteworthy feature, the therapeutic effects of a combined use of HERCEPTIN with chemotherapeutics against breast cancer have been demonstrated (Patent Literatures 1-3). However, most antigenic proteins on cancer cells to be targeted by antibody drugs such as Her2 are also expressed in normal cells, so that not only cancer cells but also normal cells expressing antigens are also cytotoxically impaired by administration of antibodies. The resulting side effects may cause for concern.
      Cytoplasmic- and proliferation-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN-1) is expressed when normal cells at the resting phase are activated or undergo cell division, and it is an intracellular protein known to form intracellular stress granules with RNA within cells, so as to be involved in mRNA transport and translational regulation. Meanwhile, many other names that represent CAPRIN-1 exist, such as GPI-anchored membrane protein 1 or membrane component surface marker 1 protein (M11S1), as if such proteins had been known to be cell membrane proteins. These names originated from a report that the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 is a membrane protein having a GPI-binding region and expressed in colorectal cancer cells (Non-patent Literature 1). However, the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 provided in this report was later revealed to be wrong. The following has recently been reported; i.e., deletion of a single nucleotide in the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like causes a frame shift, so that 80 amino acids are lost from the C-terminus, resulting in generation of an artifact (74 amino acids) which corresponds to the GPI-binding portion in the previous report, and additionally, another error is also present 5′ of the gene sequence, so that 53 amino acids were lost from the N-terminus (Non-patent Literature 2). It has been also recently reported that the protein encoded by the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like is not a cell membrane protein (Non-patent Literature 2).
      In addition, on the basis of the report of Non-patent Literature 1 that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein, Patent Literatures 4 and 5 describe that CAPRIN-1 (as a cell membrane protein) under the name of M11S1 can be used as a target of an antibody medicine in cancer therapy, although working examples do not describe treatment using an antibody against the protein. However, as reported in Non-patent Literature 2, it has been commonly believed from the time of the filing of Patent Literature 4 to date that CAPRIN-1 is not expressed on the surface of a cell. The contents of Patent Literatures 4 and 5 based only on incorrect information that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein should not clearly be understood as common general knowledge for persons skilled in the art.

      As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have now obtained a cDNA encoding a protein that binds to an antibody existing in sera from dogs with breast cancer by the SEREX method using both cDNA libraries prepared from dog testis tissues and sera of dogs with breast cancer. The present inventors have now further prepared CAPRIN-1 proteins having the even-numbered amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 2 to 30 and antibodies against such CAPRIN-1 proteins based on the obtained dog gene and the corresponding human, cattle, horse, mouse, and chicken homologous genes. Thus, the present inventors have now found that: CAPRIN-1 proteins are specifically expressed in the cells of cancers, such as breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, uterine cervix cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and renal cancer cells; and that a portion of the CAPRIN-1 protein is specifically expressed on the surface of each cancer cell. The present inventors have thus now found that an antibody or antibodies against the portion of CAPRIN-1 expressed on the surface of each cancer cell are combined with a specific antitumor agent, so that significant cancer therapeutic effects can be obtained. On the basis of these findings, the present invention as described below was completed.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002548815,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      There are different known methods of producing peptides by biotechnological means. Since the stability of short polypeptide chains in microbial host cells is usually low, and since the free peptides may have a possible toxic effect on the host organism (for example antimicrobial peptides), most methods involve producing larger precursor proteins from which the peptide is excised after the precursor protein has been purified.
      One possibility of obtaining a stable precursor protein comprises expressing a peptide together with a stable protein by way of a fusion protein. The properties of said fusion protein, which greatly influence subsequent work-up steps, are determined by the fusion partner largely independently of the peptide sequence, and are therefore readily controllable and suitable for producing peptides with different sequences.
      WO 2008/085543 describes a special method of producing proteins and peptides with the aid of a fusion protein. This fusion protein comprises aside from the desired peptide sequence a fusion partner which ensures that the fusion protein exhibits an inverse phase transition behavior. This behavior firstly involves the fusion protein to be purified from the cellular context in a simple and inexpensive manner. Secondly, the fusion partner may likewise be removed in a simple and inexpensive manner, after the peptide has been removed by proteolytical cleavage. While a fusion protein may frequently be obtained with good yields, the peptide portion of the precursor protein is usually small, and the efficiency of the process is therefore suboptimal.
      Another approach involves repetitive precursor proteins which comprise multiple copies of the desired peptide being recombinantly produced. WO 03/089455 describes the production of multimeric precursor proteins from which the desired peptide sequences which have antimicrobial properties are excised by acidic cleavage.
      There are a number of further published approaches (examples: Metlitskaya et al. Biotechnol Appl. Biochem 39; 339-345 (2004); Wang & Cai Appl. Biochem and Biotechnol. 141; 203-213 (2007)), which were used for demonstrating that peptide sequences or families of peptide sequences may be produced by a particular method with the aid of repetitive precursor proteins. To some extent the use of special auxiliary sequences which are located between the repeats of the desired peptide sequences has been described. More specifically, anionic auxiliary sequences have been proposed which apparently reduce the harmful action of cationic antimicrobial peptide sequences within a repetitive precursor protein on the host cell (cf. for example WO 00/31279 and US 2003/0219854). While the precursor protein in this repetitive approach has a higher proportion of the desired peptide sequence than is the case with fusion proteins, the properties of the repetitive precursor proteins are greatly influenced by the sequence of the desired cationic peptide.
      The inventors have no knowledge of any previous method involving the possibility of producing any peptide sequences with the aid of repetitive precursor proteins according to a simple, low-cost protocol which can be carried out in an efficient manner.
      Various antimicrobial peptides have been described in the literature and are summarized in Reviews (Hancock, R. E. W. and Lehrer, R. 1998 in Trends in Biotechnology, 16: 82-88; Hancock, R. E. W. and Sahl, H. G. 2006 in Nature Biotechnology, 24: 1551-1557).
      Fusion peptides, in which two active peptides are combined, are likewise described in the literature. Wade et al. report the antibacterial action of various fusions of Hyalophora cecropia cecropin A and the poison melittin (Wade, D. et al., 1992, International Journal of Peptide and Protein Research, 40: 429-436). Shin et al. describe the antibacterial action of a fusion peptide of Hyalophora cecropia cecropin A and Xenopus laevis magainin 2, consisting of 20 amino acids. Cecropin A consists of 37 amino acids and exhibits activity against Gram-negative bacteria that lower activity against Gram-positive bacteria. magainin 2 consists of 23 amino acids and is active against bacteria but also tumor cell lines. Compared with the fusion of cecropin A and melittin, this fusion exhibits a distinctly lower hemolytic activity with a comparable antibacterial action (Shin, S. Y. Kang, J. H., Lee, M. K., Kim, S. Y., Kim, Y., Hahm, K. S., 1998, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology International, 44: 1119-1126). US 2003/0096745 A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,727 B2 claim these fusion peptides, consisting of 20 amino acids, and variants of said fusion which, due to the substitution of amino acids, in particular of positively charged amino acids and hydrophobic amino acids, are more positively charged and more hydrophobic.
      Shin et al., 1999, describe further developments of this cecropin A-magainin 2 fusion peptide. They demonstrated that the peptide having SEQ ID NO:6 had a lower hemolytic activity compared to the starting fusion but that the antibacterial activity with respect to Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis was not adversely affected (Shin at al. 1999 Journal of Peptide Research, 53: 82-90).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002432359,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. It affects almost exclusively females (Rett, 1966, Wien Med Wochenschr 116:723-6) and it is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females. RTT is characterized by a dynamically clinical course with four consecutive stages. During Stage I (age 6-18 months), girls cease to acquire new skills; they display decelerating head growth and autistic features such as emotional withdrawal and diminished eye contact. In Stage II (age 1-4 years), affected children lose learned skills such as speech and purposeful hand use. They develop irregular breathing patterns, truncal and gait ataxia/apraxia, and stereotypical hand movements. About half the girls also develop seizures and there is some stabilization of the disease during Stage III (age 4-7 years). Seizures become less frequent during Stage IV (age 5-15 years and older), but motor deterioration continues. Hypoactivity, especially among those who cannot walk, contributes to the frequent development of scoliosis, which can cause the girls to be confined to wheelchairs. Neuropathological features of the Rett patients include a decrease in the cortical thickness as well as a reduction of the cortical neuronal size. A strong reduction of the dendritic arborization has also been described but no further gross morphological features are affected (Armstrong, 2002, Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev 8:72-6). RTT is a X-linked disease with an estimated incidence of 1:10,000 to 1:15,000. Amir et al. (1999) (Nat Genet 23:185-8) have identified mutations in the gene MECP2 as the cause of RTT. The MECP2 gene is subject to X-inactivation. Therefore, heterozygous mutant females are mosaic for MeCP2 deficiency and this is most probably one of the modulating factors influencing the phenotype of the disease. Males meeting the clinical criteria for Rett syndrome have been identified in association with a 47,XXY karyotype and from postzygotic MECP2 mutations resulting in somatic mosaicism. For reference, see L. S. Weaving et al.: Journal of Medical Genetics 2005; 42:1-7; and G. Miltenberger-Miltenyi, F. Laccone: Human Mutation 2003 Volume 22, Issue 2; 107-115.
      The MECP2 gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome at position Xq28 (Adler 1995, Mamm Genome 6(8):491-2). The gene spans 76 kb and is composed of four exons. The MECP2 gene encodes for a protein called methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), believed to play a pivotal role in silencing other genes. The MeCP2 protein has two isoforms, MeCP2 e1 and MeCP2 e2, formerly called MeCP2B and MeCP2A, respectively (Mnatzakanian et al. 2004, Nat Genet 36:339-41). The isoform e1 is made up of 498 amino acids and isoform e2 is 486 amino acids long. The isoform e1 has a distinctive 21-amino-acid peptide at N terminus including polyalanine and polyglycine tracts. The mRNA of the MECP2 e1 variant has 10-fold greater expression in the brain than that of the MECP2 e2 and it is the most abundant protein isoform in mouse and human brain. MeCP2 is an abundant mammalian protein that selectively binds 5-methyl cytosine residues in symmetrically positioned dinucleotides. CpG dinucleotides are preferentially located in the promoter regions of genes. They represent one of the elements for gene regulation being target for transcriptional silencing factors after DNA methylation.
      No successful treatment is yet known to improve the neurological outcome of individuals with Rett syndrome. According to the mutational spectrum of the MECP2 in human (Lam et al. 2000, J Med Genet 37(12):E41; Lee et al. 2001, Brain Dev 23:S138-43) and results from the RTT mouse, there is a general agreement that RTT syndrome is caused by a loss of function of MeCP2. An efficient strategy aiming to restore the MeCP2 activity should be able to compensate the loss of function of MeCP2 in deficient neuronal cells. For reference, see L. S. Weaving et al.: Journal of Medical Genetics 2005; 42:1-7; and G. Miltenberger-Miltenyi, F. Laccone: Human Mutation 2003, Volume 22, Issue 2; 107-115.
      Schwarze et al. (1999, Science 285:1569-1572) report that it is possible to deliver biologically active macromolecules into living cells using a TAT domain (transcriptional transactivator protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1). They show the production of a recombinant TAT-β-galactosidase protein and its injection intraperitoneally into mice. They found that the fusion protein was distributed to all tissues including the brain and the fusion protein was biologically active.
      WO 00/62067 (Dowdy et al.) report the use of protein transduction (PTD) molecules including the TAT protein domains for targeting therapeutic molecules in the nervous system.
      The production of proteins in heterologous expression systems (i.e. human protein in Escherichia coli) requires a corresponding expression vector and the cDNA sequence of the gene of interest. The 64 codons (nucleotide triplets) of the genetic code encode for 20 amino acids and for three translation stop signals. The genetic code is therefore redundant and this means that some amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. Methionine and tryptophane are the only amino acids encoded by one codon, ATG and TGG, respectively, while arginine, leucine and serine are encoded each by six synonymous codons. Because of the degeneration of the genetic code, many alternative nucleic acid sequences encode the same protein. The frequencies of the codons usage vary between the different organisms. These biases can strongly influence the expression of heterologous proteins (Kane, 1995, Curr Opin Biotechnol 6(5):494-500). Codon usage has been identified as the single most important factor in prokaryotic gene expression (Lithwick, 2003, Genome Res 13 (12):2665-2673).
      One objective of the present inventors is therefore to provide constructs encoding for biologically active MeCP2 proteins which are capable of entering cells of the nervous system and compensate for the loss of function of MeCP2 of affected neuronal cells.
      A therapeutic approach by delivering TAT-recombinant proteins to the brain could have the tremendous advantage of a possible rapid translation from the animal model to patients. Further advantages might be its easily controllable dosage application, very high delivery efficiency, no concerns inherent to the potentially insertional mutagenenesis or clinical side effects due to the immunological reaction against viral proteins as in case of a gene therapy approach. The PTD-protein delivery approach and its further development might allow the treatment of neurogenetic and devastating diseases like Rett syndrome.
      Since attempts to express MeCP2 protein constructs using the human cDNA sequence in amounts sufficient for therapeutic purposes were so far unsuccessful, another objective of the present invention is to provide a MeCP2 expression construct that allows an increased production of recombinant MeCP2 protein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002499046,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Whooping Cough or Pertussis is an acute, highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacterium, a microorrganism formerly isolated by Bordet and Gengou in 1906 [Bordet, J. and O. Gengou. Ann Inst Pasteur (Paris), 1906. 20: p. 731-41]. Recently, the annual morbidity of infections throughout the world was estimated in 48.5 millions. The disease is particularly severe in children with less than six months of age, with 90% of the casualties being associated to this ethareal group (300,000-400,000) [Crowcroft, N. S., et al. Lancet Infect Dis, 2003. 3(7): p. 413-8].
      Several vaccines are available against B. pertussis, distributed in two main groups according to their type: cellular vaccines, and, more recently, acellular vaccines. Vaccination has dramatically decreased the incidence of the disease, moving it from children towards teenager and adult populations. Several studies have shown teenagers as the major reservoir for B. pertussis and the main source for spreading of this disease among partially protected children. Therefore, whooping cough remains as an unsolved health problem, demanding the development of new vaccines for a better control of the epidemics and re-emergent outbreaks, and possibly to eradicate this disease in endemic regions [Cherry, J. D. Pediatrics, 2005. 115(5): p. 1422-7; Singh, M. and K. Lingappan, Chest, 2006. 130(5): p. 1547-53]. The Bordetella genera includes nine species, four of them being associated to infections in mammals ( B. holmesii, B. bronchiseptica, B. parapertussis and B. pertussis), the last two being responsible for infections in humans [Mattoo, S., et al. Front Biosci, 2001. 6: p. E168-86]. Most of their virulence factors are regulated at transcriptional level by a two-components system denominated BvgA/S ( Bordetella virulence genes Activator/Sensor) [Stibitz, S., et al. Nature, 1989. 338(6212): p. 266-9]. Among them, the most relevant factors are the Pertussis toxins (PT), the tracheal colonization factor, adenylate cyclase; and adhesins filamentous Phytohemagglutinin (PHA), Fimbriae (Fim) and Pertactin (Prn), the latter being the focus of the present invention.
      Prn is an outer membrane protein belonging to the family of type V autotransporter proteins. It is characterized by catalyzing its own transportation through the bacterial outer membrane [Henderson, I.R. Trends Microbiol, 2000. 8(12): p. 534-5]. The mature Prn is a protein of 68 kDa in B. bronchiseptica [Henderson, I.R. Infect Immun, 2001. 69(3): p. 1231-43.], 69 kDa in B. pertussis [Charles, I. G., et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1989. 86(10): p. 3554-8] and 70 kDa in B. parapertussis [Li, L. J., et al. Mol Microbiol, 1991. 5(2): p. 409-17], respectively. Its structure consists on 16 paralel strands forming a β helix and a transversal section in V form [Emsley, P., et al. Nature, 1996. 381(6577): p. 90-2.]. Numerous loops protrude from this helicoidal core. One of them is the Arg-Gly-Asp triplete (RGD), a motif associated to tissue adherence [Leininger, E., et al. Infect Immun, 1992. 60(6): p. 2380-5; Emsley, P., et al. Nature, 1996. 381(6577): p. 90-2]. The presence of this motif and numerous proline-rich regions are related to Prn functions during adhesion. Experiments have shown that the Prn can mediate adhesion to cells of the respiratory epithelium [Everest, P., et al. Microbiology, 1996. 142 (Pt 11): p. 3261-8]. Nevertheless, assays on the inhibition by human sera of B. pertussis adhesion to A549 cultured cells (alveolar human epithelium) did not evidence Prn as a crucial element during that process under the tested conditions [Rodriguez, M. E., et al. FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol, 2006. 46(1): p. 39-47].
      The Prn protein is part of acellular vaccines composed of three or more components. Acellualr vaccines can be composed of: 1) one component of PT, 2) two components: PT and PHA, 3) three components: PT, PHA and Prn, and 4) five components, including the three components previously mentioned and also the Fimbriae 2 (Fim2) and Fimbriae 3 (Fim3) proteins. In humans, the levels of the anti-Prn, anti-Fim2 and anti-PT antibodies correlate with protection levels against the disease [Cherry, J. D., et al. Vaccine, 1998. 16(20): p. 1901-6; Storsaeter, J., et al. Vaccine, 2003. 21(25-26): p. 3542-9].
      The active immunization with Prn of B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica induces a specific antibody response against Prn, confering protection in different animal models [Charles, I. G., et al. Eur J Immunol, 1991. 21(5): p. 1147-53; Roberts, M., et al. Vaccine, 1992. 10(1): p. 43-8]. Similarly, the passive administration of anti-Prn monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) protected mice in the model of respiratory challenge [King, A. J., et al. Microbiology, 2001. 147(Pt 11): p. 2885-95]. Protection levels in mice subjected to the intranasal challenge assay (INCA) were increased by adding Prn to vaccines containing PT and PHA [Guiso, N., et al. Vaccine, 1999. 17(19): p. 2366-76]. It has been recently shown that Prn is the only component of acellular vaccines which generates an antibody response of such a level that correlates to the opsonophagocytic activity [Hellwig, S. M., et al. J Infect Dis, 2003. 188(5): p. 738-42]. In spite of efficacious vaccines and the well established vaccination programs available, whooping cough is still endemic in regions of America, Europe and Asia, being considered as a re-emergent disease [Raguckas, S. E., et al. Pharmacotherapy, 2007. 27(1): p. 41-52]. One of the hypotheses trying to explain this phenomenon is based on the loss of efficacy, due to appearance of resistant strains [Mooi, F. R et al. Emerg Infect Dis, 2001. 7(3 Suppl): p. 526-8]. Prn is one of the most polymorphic proteins in B. pertussis. It contains two variable regions designated as region 1 (R1) and 2 (R2), respectively, with repetitive amino acid sequences rich in proline Gly-Gly-X-X-Pro (GGXXP) (SEQ. ID. No. 7) and Pro-Gln-Pro (PQP) motifs. The R1 region is located in the protruding loop proximal to the aminoterminal sequence (N-terminal) and near to the RGD motif, while the R2 region is located near to the carboxyl terminal end (C-terminal) [Hijnen, M., et al. Infect Immun, 2004. 72(7): p. 3716-23]. Up to 12 different variants of Prn (Prn1, Prn2, Prn3 . . . Prn12) have been identified in B. pertussis, as shown in the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information of the United States of America (NCBI). Strains bearing the Prn1, Prn2 and Prn3 are distributed worldwide. Numerous strain characterization studies, either retrospective or of strains currently circulating, were carried out in American, European, Asian and Australian regions and showed a tendency towards a progressive persistence of Prn2 strains over Prn1 strains, the Prn2 strains predominating in most of the countries studied [Mooi, F. R., et al. Infect Immun, 1998. 66(2): p. 670-5; Cassiday, P et al. J Infect Dis, 2000. 182(5): p. 1402-8; Weber, C. et al. J Clin Microbiol, 2001. 39(12): p. 4396-403; Hallander, H. O., et al. J Clin Microbiol, 2005. 43(6): p. 2856-65; van Amersfoorth, S. C., et al. J Clin Microbiol, 2005. 43(6): p. 2837-43; Byrne, S, et al. BMC Infect Dis, 2006. 6: p. 53].
      Current differences in the amino acid sequence of Prn between cellular (DPTc) or acellular (DPTa) vaccines and circulating strains is one of the factors supporting the hypothesis of the efficacy loss of vaccines available, due to the appearance of new strains. Studies in populations vaccinated with DPTc or (DPTa), and non-vaccinated populations, in Netherlands and Italy indicated that these types of vaccines protect better against circulating strains similar to the vaccine strain [Mooi, F. R., et al. Infect Immun, 1998. 66(2): p. 670-5; Mastrantonio, P., et al. Microbiology, 1999. 145 (Pt 8): p. 2069-75]. In agreement with these findings, it was shown in the mice model that vaccination with DPTc differentially protects against strains bearing Prn1 and Prn2, indicating that changes in the Prn R1 region can confer resistance levels [King, A. J., et al. Microbiology, 2001. 147(Pt 11): p. 2885-95]. However, massive studies stratifying B. pertussis strains according to country of origin, vaccination status, and type of vaccines (DPTc and DPTa), did not show significant differences in the frequencies of prn, ptxC, ptxA or tcfA2 alleles for circulating strains and vaccination programs [van Amersfoorth, S. C., et al. J Clin Microbiol, 2005. 43(6): p. 2837-43].
      The high prevalence of Prn2 strains in many countries is indicative of the favored transmission of these strains by means still unraveled, although the findings mentioned above hardly link the origin of new variants to vaccination. Remarkably, in the above mentioned study [van Amersfoorth, S. C., et al. J Clin Microbiol, 2005. 43(6): p. 2837-43], the three clinically isolated strains bearing allelles similar to that of the vaccines used were found only in non-vaccinated children. Either casual or not, it suggests that Prn1 strains are favored in niches devoid of specific immunity. On the other hand, the recent identification of a phage infecting Bordetella (BPP-1) by using Prn as primary receptor, suggested that variations in this protein might be triggered by selective pressures other than those imposed by the immune system [Liu, M., et al. Science, 2002. 295(5562): p. 2091-4]. The possible influences of both phenomena, together with other unknown factors leading to harmonized variations in B. pertussis, are not excluded.
      The evolution of Pertussis epidemiology has been simulated by a mathematical model, integrating the incidence of the disease and the pathogen's transmission independently [Aguas, R., et al. Lancet Infect Dis, 2006. 6(2): p. 112-7]. This model predicts that regular boosting doses would not be capable of eliminating the severity grades of the disease, observed in current epidemics. It is highly probable that this should be caused by the short lifespan of the protection conferred by the available acellular vaccines (4-12 years), and also the variability of the immune response and the different types of vaccines. This model predicts as the most optimistic scenario that where vaccines could generate an immunity superior to the natural one, a paradigm still unreached by the cellular and acellular vaccines available.
      The main purpose of the present invention resides on the contribution to develop more efficacious acellular vaccines against Whooping Cough. The main work preceding the present invention were based on administering immunogenic preparations obtained by mixing Prn proteins (Nicole Guiso et al., WO 01/90143 A2 y US 2006/0008474 A1) or synthetic peptides of the Prn R1 region (Frederik Mooi et al., WO 02/00695 A2). Therefore, the development of more efficacious acellular vaccines is an important problem to prevent Whooping Cough.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
","DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
      This invention contributes to solve the above mentioned problems, and comprises the engineering of the prnA gene, coding for the outer membrane protein of B. pertussis denominated Pertactin (Prn). This invention suffices the needs evidenced in the state of the art, making possible obtaining different variants of engineered Prn, in such a way that they comprise in their structure two different polymorphic domains of the Prn R1 region. The versatility of the invention also covers the engineering of new Prn molecules, additionally comprising three or more different polymorphic domains of the Prn R1 region.
      Is subject of the present invention a polynucleotidic sequence coding for an engineered Prn protein, wherein said protein comprises up to the first 300 amino acids proximal to the N-terminal end of a natural, mature Prn of a given type (PrnX300), and an aminoacidic sequence comprising up to 620 amino acids proximal to the C-terminal end of a natural, mature Prn of given type (PrnY620), resulting in an engineered PrnX300-PrnY620Prn protein.
      In the context of the present invention, the term ‘engineered Prn’ refers to a protein resulting from coupling, adjacently or not, of a fragment comprising up to the first 300 amino acids proximal to the N-terminal end of a given natural, mature Prn protein, to another fragment comprising the last 620 amino acids proximal to the C-terminal end of a natural, mature Prn protein.
      The new Prn engineered variants are obtained by molecular mutagenesis, by adjacent coupling of sequences comprising up to the first 300 amino acids proximal to the N-terminal end of a natural, mature Prn of a given type, to sequences comprising up to the last 620 amino acids proximal to the C-terminal end of a natural, mature Prn of a given type. The new variants of engineered Prn comprise sequences from the same or different type of Prn in a single molecule, without affecting the protective immune response.
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, different variants of Prn engineered variants are obtained, encoded by the nucleic acid sequences identified as SEQ ID NO 1-6. Highly significantly protection levels and opsonophagocytic activities were obtained by immunizing mice with the different variants of engineered Prn, higher than those obtained with natural Prn molecules formulated alone or combined in mixes. The immune response generated with the engineered Prn was equally effective against strains expressing different types of Prn.
      In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the fragment comprising the first 300 amino acids proximal to the N-terminal end of a natural, mature Prn of a given type, named PrnX300, corresponds to Prn from the genera Bordetella. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, this fragment corresponds to Prn molecules from B. pertussis or B. parapertussis, preferably Prn1, Prn2 and Prn3 variants of B. pertussis.
      In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the las 620 amino acids proximal to the C-terminal end of a natural, mature Prn of a given type, named PrnY620, corresponds to Prn from the genera Bordetella. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, this fragment corresponds to Prn molecules from B. pertussis or B. parapertussis, preferably Prn1, Prn2 and Prn3 variants of B. pertussis.
      The polynucleotidic sequence of the present invention codes for a polypeptidic sequence comprising any possible combination of Prn types in the format PrnX300-PrnY620.
      The amino acid sequences PrnX300 and PrnY620 coded by the polynucleotide sequence of the present invention are adjacently coupled, or by using the amino acid sequences IDNATWVMTDN (SEQ. ID. No. 8) or IDNATWVMTDNIDNATWVMTDN (SEQ. ID. No. 9).
      In the present invention, the amino acid sequences PrnX300 and PrnY620 can be devoid of repetitive sequences, preferably of GGXXP (SEQ. ID. No. 7) and PQP sequences of the R1 and R2 regions. The evidences supporting this design are the following: the Region 1 (R1), comprising the repetitive sequence GGXXP is weakly recognized by human and rabbit sera, indicating that it is not an immunodominant region [Hijnen, M., F. R. Mooi, et al. (2004). Infect Immun 72(7): 3716-23]. On the other hand, recent work reported Prn mutants where the repetitive GGXXP (SEQ. ID. No. 7) and PQP sequences or regions containing these sequences were deleted. GGXXP (SEQ. ID. No. 7) deletions did not affect the physicochemical properties of the mutant Prn molecules obtained, as evidenced in the similar methods used for expression and purification of mutant and non-mutant Prn proteins [Hijnen, M., P. G. van Gageldonk, et al. (2005). Protein Expr Purif 41(1): 106-12]. Similarly, deletions of the GGXXP (SEQ. ID. No. 7) sequences did not significantly affect structural properties, since Prn molecules mutated in R1 were well recognized by MAbs generated against conformational epitopes in natural Prn molecules, and also not recognized by anti-GGXXP MAbs directed against linear GGXXP (SEQ. ID. No. 7) epitopes. Additionally, it was observed that certain mutations inside R1 can enhance the binding capacity to certain MAbs against conformational epitopes. Finally, there were evidences indicating that R1 (GGXXP) (SEQ. ID. No. 7) and R2 (PQP) form a single epitope [Hijnen, M., R. de Voer, et al. (2007). Vaccine 25(31): 5902-14].
      In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the said polynucleotidic sequence codes for an engineered Prn, wherein said amino acid PrnX300 and PrnY620 sequences comprise heterologous peptides able to function as T helper cell epitopes isolated from Diphtheria, Tetanus, the hepatitis B virus (HBV), Polioviruses, Vaccinia, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or the human Influenza virus. It is well known among people skilled in the art that the immune response against a given antigen can be enhanced by including this type of epitopes.
      An additional preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises the polynucleotidic sequences according to claim 1, wherein said polynucleotide sequences could be optimized for optimal codon usage, to increase the expression of the encoded protein in bacteria, yeast, insect or mammalian cells. The resulting increase in the expression of the molecules encoded by recombinant procedures is widely know by people skilled in the art in this particular technical field.
      In another preferred embodiment, the new protein subject of the present invention can be one of the multiple components of a new combined vaccine, emphasizing that none of the precedent inventions comprised obtaining the minimal number of molecular entities satisfying the existing requirements of this technical field.
      Finally, the demands for vaccine preparations able to generate cross-protection between B. pertussis and B. parapertussis are more than evident in the state of the art. The present invention also comprises generating engineered Prn molecules comprising in a single structure different polymorphic regions of different Bordetella species, based on the high homology levels existing between Prn proteins of the different Bordetella species.
      Unexpectedly, the engineered Prn subject of the present invention was not only capable of inducing an effective immune response against different Prn1- and Prn2-expressing B. pertussis strains, but also generated antibody responses more effective than that generated by other non-engineered recombinant Prn proteins, as evidenced in the mice respiratory challenge model and the opsonophagocytic assay. Surprisingly, the immune response induced by the engineered Prn was superior to that induced by an equimolar mix of Prn1 and Prn2 (Prn1+Prn2).
      Vaccine compositions made by mixing different Prn proteins of the same or different species, although covering polymorphisms, lead to technical difficulties associated to the new production processes, such as the undesired increase in the concentration of contaminants and the productive inconsistency between lots. This is an essential aspect to develop combined vaccines, composed of multiple antigens with quite different characteristics, which can compromise the systemic immunogenicity of the formulation. On the other hand, it is expected that strategies based on synthetic peptides of the R1 region could lead to vaccines less effective than vaccines currently available, by excluding other epitopes present in the natural Prn from the antigen, relevant to develop a protective response.
      To meet this unsolved requirement of this technical field, the present invention comprises a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more engineered Prn, coded by polynucleotidic sequences from Claims 1 to 13, in amounts sufficient to generate humoral and cellular immune responses effective against Bordetella species, when administered through immunization procedures in mammals, and preferably, in humans. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more Prn engineered variants generates humoral and cellular immune responses effective against B. pertussis.
      It is also the aim of the present invention a life or attenuated vaccine comprising one or more Prn engineered variants, coded by sequences from Claims 1 to 13, wherein said Prn engineered variants are expressed in the outer membrane of the life or attenuated organism. In this live or attenuated vaccine, said polynucleotidic sequences from Claims 1 to 13 are included in a plasmid vector or a bacterial chromosome.
      In another embodiment of the present invention, said polynucleotidic sequences from Claims 1 to 13, which code for Prn engineered variants, are included in a vector for expression in mammalian cells. In another embodiment of the present invention, said expression vector which contains the polynucleotidic sequences from Claims 1 to 13 is the basis for a nucleic acids vaccine.
      In another embodiment of the invention, the polypeptidic sequences coded by said polynucleotidic sequences from Claims 1 to 13, can be used to detect Bordetella infections. Is also the aim of the present invention a diagnostic kit to detect the presence or absence of antibodies against Bordetella, comprising polypeptidic sequences coded by the polynucleotidic sequences referred on Claims 1 to 13.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02369616,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       A variety of disorders and therapies involve a deficiency of immune cells. For example, HIV infection results in a loss of CD4+ T-cells, while therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy generally result in a loss of a wide variety of blood cells. Attempts have been made to provide specific protein drugs that can replenish specific types of immune cells that are lost as a result of a disease or therapy. For example, in cancer chemotherapy, erythropoietin is used to replenish red blood cells, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used to replenish neutrophils, and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is used to replenish granulocytes and macrophages. These protein drugs, although beneficial, have relatively short serum half-lives such that immune cell replenishment is often insufficient. Moreover, no specific treatment is currently in clinical use to specifically stimulate T or B-cell development, even though loss of these cells as a result of disease or after certain myeloablative treatments is know to be particularly deleterious to a patient's health. Thus, there exists a need in the art to develop immune system stimulators and restoratives, particularly of lymphocytes, that have extended serum half-lives.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
       The present invention is directed to interleukin-7 (IL-7) fusion proteins which have improved biological properties compared to corresponding wild-type IL-7 proteins. Moreover, the present invention is based, in part, on the finding that IL-7 fusion proteins having particular structural features have improved biological properties compared to wild-type recombinant IL-7.
       Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention features a fusion protein including a first portion comprising an immunoglobulin (Ig) chain and a second portion comprising interleukin-7 (IL-7), wherein the IL-7 fusion protein has an increased biological activity, such as an extended-serum half-life or in promoting the survival or expansion of immune cells, as compared to wild-type IL-7.
       In one embodiment, the invention features a fusion protein including a first portion including an Ig chain and a second portion including IL-7, wherein the amino acid residues at positions 70 and 91 of IL-7 are glycosylated and the amino acid residue at position 116 of IL-7 is non-glycosylated. Throughout this document, amino acid positions of IL-7 refer to the corresponding positions in the mature, human IL-7 sequence. In one embodiment, the amino acid residue at position 116 of IL-7 is asparagine. In another embodiment, the amino acid residue at position 116 of IL-7 is altered such that it does not serve as a glycosylation site. In one embodiment, the IL-7 moiety comprises disulfide bonds between Cys2 and Cys92, Cys34 and Cys129, and Cys47 and Cys141 of IL-7.
       In another embodiment, the invention includes a fusion protein including a first portion including an Ig chain and a second portion including IL-7, wherein the IL-7 comprises disulfide bonding between Cys2 and Cys92, Cys34 and Cys129, and Cys47 and Cys141 of IL-7. In one embodiment, the amino acid residue at position 116 of IL-7 is non-glycosylated. In another embodiment, the amino acid residue at position 116 of IL-7 is asparagine or is altered such that it does not serve as a glycosylation site. In another embodiment, the amino acid residues at positions 70 and 91 of IL-7 are glycosylated.
       The Ig chain is generally an intact antibody or portion thereof, such as an Fc region. The Ig chain of the IL-7 fusion protein can be derived from any known Ig isotype and can include at least a portion of one or more constant domains. For example, the constant domain can be selected from the group consisting of a CH 1 region, a hinge region, a CH2 region, and a CH3 region. In one embodiment, the Ig moiety includes a hinge region, a CH2 region and a CH3 region. The Ig chain is optionally connected to the IL-7 portion by a linker.
       Ig moieties of a single antibody isotype, such as IgG1 or IgG2, and hybrid Ig moieties are permitted in the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, the Ig moiety includes a hinge region derived from one isotype (i.e. IgG2) and a CH region from another isotype (i.e. IgG1). An Ig chain including an Fc portion of IgG1 can advantageously be modified to include the mutations Asn297Gln and Tyr296Ala. Furthermore, an Ig chain including an Fc portion of IgG2 can be advantageously modified to include the mutations Asn297Gln and Phe296Ala.
       The IL-7 portion of the IL-7 fusion protein described above may comprise the mature portion of the IL-7 portion. In one embodiment, the IL-7 portion can further include a deletion, such as an internal deletion. In one example, IL-7 can include an eighteen amino acid deletion of amino acids 96 to 114 of SEQ ID NO:1.
       In other embodiments, the invention includes purified nucleic acids encoding the IL-7 fusion proteins described above and cultured host cells including these nucleic acids.
       In another aspect, the invention includes a method of preparing an IL-7 fusion protein including expressing in a host cell the nucleic acid described above and harvesting the fusion protein.
       In another aspect, the invention includes a composition such as a pharmaceutical composition which includes the fusion protein described above.
       In another aspect, the invention includes a method of treating a patient by administering Fc-IL-7 fusion proteins.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002429243,"BACKGROUND ART
      The production of recombinant proteins for therapeutic, nutraceutical or industrial uses has enjoyed great success over the past decade. Different eukaryotic cells and organisms have been shown to be able to produce active protein-based therapeutics. Unfortunately, the high costs frequently derived from low recombinant protein production levels and/or from protein isolation and purification procedures, can invalidate their industrial application. Active research is done to improve both production levels and purification procedures by different approaches.
      A new technology based on the fusion of a plant seed storage protein domain with the protein of interest (WO 2004/003207) has been developed to increase the stability and accumulation of recombinant proteins in higher plants. These storage proteins are specific to plant seeds wherein they stably accumulate in protein bodies (Galili et al., 1993, Trends Cell Biol 3:437-442).
      The storage proteins are inserted into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a signal peptide and are assembled either in the endoplasmic reticulum developing specific organelles called ER-derived protein bodies (ER-PBs) or in protein storage vacuoles (PSV) (Okita and Rogers 1996 Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol Mol. Biol. 47: 327-50; Herman and Larkins 1999 Plant Cell 11:601-613; Sanderfoot and Raikel 1999 Plant Cell 11:629-642). Recombinant storage proteins have also been described to assemble in PB-like organelles in non-plant host systems as Xenopus oocytes and yeast.
      Expression of cereal prolamins (the most abundant cereal storage proteins) has been described in Xenopus oocytes after injection of the corresponding mRNAs. This system has been used as a model to study the targeting properties of these storage proteins (Simon et al., 1990, Plant Cell 2:941-950; Altschuler et al., 1993, Plant Cell 5:443-450; Torrent et al., 1994, Planta 192:512-518) and to test the possibility of modifying the 19 kDa α-zein, a maize prolamin, by introducing the essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan into its sequence, without altering its stability (Wallace et al, 1988, Science 240:662-664).
      Zeins, the complex group of maize prolamins, have also been produced in yeast with various objectives. Coraggio et al., 1988, Eur J Cell Biol 47:165-172, expressed native and modified α-zeins in yeast to study targeting determinants of this protein. Kim et al., 2002, Plant Cell 14: 655-672, studied the possible α-, β-, γ- and δ-zein interactions that lead to protein body formation. To address this question, they transformed yeast cells with cDNAs encoding these proteins. In addition, those authors constructed zein-GFP fusion proteins to determine the subcellular localization of zein proteins in the yeast cells. The yeast cells, then, were used as a model expression system to study zein properties. It is worth to noting that Kim et al., 2002, Plant Cell 14: 655-672, concluded that yeast is not a good model to study zein interactions because zeins, by themselves, were poorly accumulated in transformed yeast. The yeast cells were also used as a model to study the mechanisms that control the transport and protein body deposition of the wheat storage proteins called gliadins (Rosenberg et al., 1993, Plant Physiol 102:61-69).
      Here we show that fusion of a protein sequence that mediates induction of recombinant protein body-like assemblies (RPBLAs), as for instance, prolamins or prolamin domains with a peptide or protein of interest (target) mediates the accumulation of those RPBLAs in cells of organisms such as fungi (which includes yeast), algae and animals. Interestingly, these fusion proteins are stably accumulated in animal cells, inside protein body-like organelles structures.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002582247,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 3.8 million deaths in men and 3.4 million deaths in women annually. As the population grows older and comorbidities (e.g., obesity and metabolic syndrome) become more prevalent, as in recent years, the enormous public health burden caused by ischemic heart disease is likely to increase even further (reviewed in Yellon et al, N Engl J Med, 2007; 357: 1121-1135).
      Coronary heart disease refers to the failure of coronary circulation to provide adequate blood supply to cardiac muscle and surrounding tissue. The most common cause of coronary heart disease is the accumulation of atheromatous plaques (i.e., fatty deposits) within the walls of coronary arteries. Occlusion of a coronary artery limits blood flow to the heart, leads to ischemia of the myocardial cells (i.e., cell starvation secondary to a lack of oxygen) and may result in myocardial cell death, which is called myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI)—commonly known as a heart attack. AMI is the leading cause of death in both Europe and the United States, and remains a frequent (more than 1.5 million new cases per year in the United States) and disabling (leading to heart failure) disease. Infarct size is a major determinant of myocardial functional recovery and mortality after AMI. Currently, the most effective way to limit infarct size is to reperfuse the jeopardized myocardium as soon as possible with the use of coronary angioplasty or thrombolysis and to prevent reocclusion of the coronary artery with the use of antiplatelet therapy. Reperfusion, or restoration of blood flow to the ischemic myocardium, is achieved with thrombolytic therapy that dissolves the thrombus or through dilatation of the occluded artery by percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Reperfusion is necessary for the salvage of myocardial cells and cardiac function in general. However, reperfusion initiates a cascade of events that leads to “reperfusion injury”. This also occurs following recovery from cardioplegic arrest of the heart during bypass surgery. Reperfusion injury is characterized by arrhythmias, endothelial dysfunction leading to the no-reflow phenomenon and myocardial stunning (reversible loss of myocardial contractility).
      Reperfusion injury culminates in apoptotic death of cardiac cells that were viable immediately before myocardial reperfusion. The involvement of a highly-regulated form of cell death during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion may lead to novel therapeutic interventions in the reperfusion phase. However, the apoptosis signalling pathways that are involved during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion have not yet been fully delineated in vivo.
      Finding new treatments for inhibiting apoptosis (i.e., “programmed cell death”), and in particular for treating myocardial infarction and reperfusion injury, thus constitutes a real challenge to protect cardiac function and to save lives.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The invention is based on the finding that it is possible to decrease apoptosis of cardiac cells after myocardial infarction by inhibiting the Fas signalling pathway. The Fas Receptor trimerizes upon binding to the FasL (Fas Ligand) and induces apoptosis through a cytoplasmic domain called DD (Death Domain) that interacts with signalling adaptors such as FAF-1 (Fas-Associated Factor-1), FADD (Fas-Associated Death Domain), DAXX (Death-Domain Associated protein), FAP-1, FLASH (FLICE-associated huge) and RIP (Receptor-Interacting Protein). DAXX and FADD independently bind to Fas, and activate distinct apoptotic pathways. DAXX can enhance Fas-mediated apoptosis by activating the JNK kinase cascade, culminating in phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors such as c-Jun. In contrast, FADD triggers, through a cascade of signalling caspases, the release of mitochondrial pro-apoptotic factors like CytoC (Cytochrome-C) and SMAC (Second Mitochondria-derived Activator of Caspases) also called Diablo.
      The inventors have shown that inhibiting the interaction of the Fas Receptor with DAXX (SEQ ID NO: 1) or with FADD (SEQ ID NO: 8) leads to a strong decrease in the apoptosis of cardiac cells after myocardial infarction. Furthermore, the present inventors have unexpectedly found that small fragments of DAXX and of FADD retain the anti-apoptotic ability of the full proteins DAXX and FADD, respectively.
      Accordingly, the present invention relates to a peptide consisting of:
      a fragment of 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 or 24 consecutive amino acid residues of the DAXX protein of SEQ ID NO: 1, wherein said fragment comprises the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5, or
      a fragment of 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 or 17 consecutive amino acid residues of the FADD protein of SEQ ID NO: 8, wherein said fragment comprises the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12,
wherein said peptide is capable of inhibiting cell apoptosis.

In other embodiments, an anti-apoptotic peptide is a FADD fragment consisting of the amino acid sequence set forth in any one of SEQ ID NOs: 45-57.
      In another aspect, the present invention relates to a peptidomimetic of an anti-apoptotic peptide according to the invention.
      In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a conjugate comprising an anti-apoptotic peptide or a peptidomimetic according to the invention linked to a Cell Penetrating Peptide. The Cell Penetrating Peptide may be Tat, RXR, Bpep or Pip2b.

      In particular, in certain preferred embodiments, the conjugate consists of the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 58, SEQ ID NO: 59, SEQ ID NO: 60 or SEQ ID NO: 61.
      In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and an effective amount of at least one peptide, or at least one peptidomimetic or at least one conjugate according to the invention.
      In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention further comprises at least one additional biologically active agent. In particular, the biologically active agent may be selected from the group consisting of cyclosporine A, BH4, and combinations thereof.
      In still another aspect, the present invention provides the peptides, peptidomimetics, conjugates and pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body, in particular for use in a method for inhibiting cell apoptosis in the human or animal body.
      In certain embodiments, the peptides, peptidomimetics, conjugates and pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are used in a method for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cerebral infarction, organ transplantations, cardiac interventions (extra-corporally circulation and temporary vessel occlusion), or acute circulation perturbations (state of shock), in the human or animal body.
      In other embodiments, the peptides, peptidomimetics, conjugates and pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are used in a method for treatment of ischemia, in particular cardiac ischemia, kidney ischemia, ischemic colitis, mesenteric ischemia, brain ischemia, limb ischemia or skin ischemia, in the human or animal body.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002494106,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a non-enveloped small double-stranded circular DNA virus belonging to polyomavirus subfamily of papova virus family. HPV can be spread through intimate contact among human beings, leading to such lesions in the infected persons as verruca vulgaris on the skin and condylomata acuminata around the anus and genitalia, which are ranked as sexually transmitted diseases. The results of investigation published by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1995 showed that HPV is closely responsible for cervical cancer. It is thus clear that HPV has become a pathogen that is severely harmful to human health. Therefore, it is much significant to develop highly efficient and inexpensive HPV vaccines for the prevention of cervical cancer in women and the sexually transmitted diseases caused by HPV infection.
      More than 100 subtypes of HPV have been identified currently. Nearly 100% of the cervical cancer patients can be detected positive for the presence of high-risk HPV DNA in the pathologic tissues by using sensitive detection methods. In terms of the relationship between HPV subtypes and malignancies in genital tract of female patient, HPV can be classified into low-risk type and high-risk type. HPV6, 11, 34, 40 and 42 and the like are low-risk HPV subtypes, typically found in benign cervical lesions such as cervical condylomas and mild atypical hyperplasia of cervical epithelium; while HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45 are high-risk HPV subtypes, mostly found in severe atypical hyperplasia of cervical epithelium as well as cervical cancer. A series of studies on different human populations have substantiated that HPV 16 and 18 infections in genital tract are more highly associated with the occurrence of cervical cancer than other risk factors. Among cervical cancer patients, about 50 to 60% of the cases are caused by HPV 16 infection, about 14% by HPV 18, about 8% by HPV 45, and about 5% by HPV 31, with the remaining 23% of the cases caused by other HPV subtypes.
      HPV is non-enveloped and globular in shape with a diameter of about 45 to 55 nm, having an icosahedrally symmetric deflective capsid consisting of 72 capsid particles. The virion capsid is essentially comprised of major capsid proteins (L1) and minor capsid proteins (L2). After being expressed in cells, major capsid proteins L1 can be self-assembled into capsid particles called virus-like particles (VLPs).
      A normal woman has a life-time accumulative probability of about 40% for cervical infection by at least one subtype of HPV during her whole life. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop suitably-priced and advantageously protective vaccines against cervical cancer, especially vaccines against HPV 16 and HPV 18, for lowering the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer in women.
      Although some vaccines have been developed against HPV in the prior art, these vaccines generally have the problems of low expression efficiency of HPV protein, low activity of the expressed protein, inability of the protein to assemble into virus-like particles or undesirability of the immunological effect of the assembled particles. Consequently, there exists a need in the art for improved HPV vaccine products.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02358982,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      In the central nervous system (CNS) of higher vertebrates, regeneration of axons after injury is almost absent and structural plasticity is limited. Growth inhibitors associated with CNS myelin are likely to play an important role. This is evidenced by a monoclonal antibody (mAb), IN-1, that neutralizes a potent neurite growth inhibitor myelin protein, thereby promoting long-distance axonal regeneration and enhancing compensatory plasticity following spinal cord or brain lesions in adult rats.
      A number of in vitro and in vivo observations have revealed a new aspect of neurite growth regulation which is the presence of repulsive and inhibitory signals and factors (Keynes and Cook, 1995, Curr. Opin. Neurosci. 5:75-82). Most of these signals seemed to be proteins or glycoproteins. A first breakthrough towards identification of the factors was the purification and cDNA cloning of a chick brain-derived growth cone collapse inducing molecule, Collapsin-1, now called Semaphorin 3A.
      A second group of repulsive guidance cues recently purified and cloned is now designed as Ephrins. They are ligands for the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family. Ephrin-A5 and Ephrin-A2 are expressed as gradients in the optic tectum of the chick embryo, and their ectopic expression or deletion causes guidance errors of ingrowing retinal axons. Like the Semaphorins, the Ephrin family has 15 to 20 members, each with a complex and dynamic expression in and outside of the nervous system. The functions of most of these molecules remain to be analyzed.
      A third group of guidance cues which can repulse growing axons and is expressed in the developing nervous system are the Netrins. Netrin has been purified as a floor plate derived chemoattractant for commissural axons in early spinal cords, like its C. elegans ortholog unc-6. Netrin-1 turned out to have repulsive effects for certain types of neurons depending on the type of receptor present on the target neuronal growth cones (Tessier-Lavigne et al., 1996, Science 274:1123-33).
      Previously, a potent neurite growth inhibitory activity associated with adult CNS oligodendrocytes and myelin was reported by Canoni and Schwab (1988, J. Cell Biol. 106:1281-1288). A major constituent is a high molecular weight membrane protein (NI-250, with a smaller component, NI-35, in rat) which was recently purified, and which is related to the subject of the present invention, and is bound by the neutralizing mAb, IN-1 (Canoni and Schwab, 1988, J. Cell Biol. 106:1281-1288; U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,133; 5,250,414; PCT Publication WO 93/00427).
      Myelin-associated neurite growth inhibitors play a crucial role in preventing regeneration of lesioned CNS axons. When oligodendrocyte development and myelin formation is blocked in chicken or rats, the regeneration permissive period following CNS lesions is prolonged. Indeed, myelin formation coincides in time with the end of the developmental period where the CNS shows high structural plasticity and a high potential for regeneration.
      NI-250 and NI-35 are likely to be major components of the myelin-associated growth inhibition as evidenced by in vivo application of IN-1 to spinal cord lesioned adult rats which induced regeneration of corticospinal axons over long distances and allowed motor and behavior functional recovery especially with regard to locomotion. Similar experiments on the optic nerve and the cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathway also demonstrated the in vivo relevance of the IN-1 recognized antigen, NI-35/250 (Schnell and Schwab, 1990, Nature 343:269-272; Bregman et al., 1995, Nature 378:498-501).
      Unlesioned fiber systems also respond to the neutralization of neurite growth inhibitors by IN-1. Recent experiments have conclusively shown that following a selective corticospinal tract lesion (pyramidotomy), intact fibers sprout across the midline in the spinal cord and brainstem and establish a bilateral innervation pattern, accompanied by an almost full behavioral recovery of precision movements in the presence of IN-1 (Z'Graggen et al., 1988, J. Nuroscience 18(12):4744-4757).
      Isolation of the gene that encodes the neurite growth inhibitory protein provides multiple opportunities for developing products useful in neuronal regeneration and in treatment of various neurological disorders, including DNS tumor.

      The present invention provides means for controlling the chromatographic peak shape for improved removal of impurities, e.g. related impurities which are otherwise difficult to remove upon applying a high load of the protein of interest to a column of a chromatographic solid phase material. The peak shape is controlled by means of the presence of di- or polyvalent metal ions in the protein-containing solution applied (i.e. loaded) to the chromatographic column, in combination with adjustment of the pH of the eluent e.g. in view of the isoelectric point (pI) for the protein of interest, and renders it possible to collect a very concentrated pool of the protein of interest in purified form.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002758802,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      Emulsified hydrocarbon fuels have become increasingly important as a useful fuel for steam generation in power plant and other steam raising facilities to replace coal and petroleum coke, has environmental drawbacks, and natural gas which is relatively more expensive. The high cost of natural gas has particular ramifications in the petroleum processing art and specifically in the steam assisted gravity drainage technique (SAGD) as related to the production of heavy oils and natural bitumens. As is known, the SAGD and congener techniques require the use of steam turbines for injecting steam into a subterranean formation to mobilize highly viscous hydrocarbon material. Conventionally, natural gas has been used to fire the steam generators, however, this is unattractive from a financial point of view and has other inherent drawbacks. With the advent of emulsified hydrocarbons, especially those manufactured from hydrocarbons or their products from indigenous hydrocarbon production, it has been found that the heat content is adequate to burn in a steam generation environment.
      One of the first pioneering fuels in this field was Orimulsion, manufactured in Venezuela by Bitor, and shipped worldwide to supply power generation plants. Building on the success of Orimulsion, other emulsified fuels have been developed such as MSAR™ (Multi-Phase Superfine Atomized Residue), by Quadrise Ltd. and now further developed by Quadrise Canada Fuel Systems, Inc. MSAR™ is an oil-in-water emulsion fuel where the oil is a hydrocarbon with an API gravity between 15 and −10. Typical oil-water ratios lie in the range 65% to 74%. Because of the presence of oil droplets in water, MSAR™ is essentially a pre-atomized fuel. This means that the burner atomizer does not do mechanical work to produce oil droplets, as in conventional fuel oil combustion, but that it is the emulsion manufacturing equipment that produces the oil droplets. Pre-atomization literally means ‘before the atomizer’ and so the MSAR™ manufacturing equipment is essentially the atomizer of this process. Typical mean droplet size characteristics of MSAR™ are around 5 microns, whereas typical mean droplet size characteristics produced during fuel oil atomization in a burner atomizer are between 150 and 200 microns. Therefore, the enormous increase in surface area brought about by producing much smaller droplets in the MSAR™ production process, compared with a conventional burner atomizer, leads to much more rapid and complete combustion, despite the fact that there are significant quantities of water present. In addition, when MSAR™ passes through a conventional atomizer, as it must do in order to be combusted, 150-200 micron water droplets containing the 5 micron oil droplets are formed. Water therefore finds itself located in the interstitial zones between each assembly of oil droplets. This interstitial water, between the oil droplets, spontaneously vaporizes and this leads to further break-up of the already small (5 micron) droplets. This process is known as secondary atomization. Because of this secondary atomization and the earlier described pre-atomization, MSAR™ has been found to be a particularly effective fuel, with a carbon burnout rate of 99.99%. Carbon burnout is obviously an important aspect of any combustion process and the fact that MSAR™ carbon burnout is so high, substantially reduces the amount of carbon coated ash that collects in the burner and/or furnace. As is known, if the carbon burnout is low, then carbon will deposit with ash on boiler surfaces and will effectively lead to the production of coke; this leads to inefficiencies and/or inoperability in the overall process. By providing a 99.99% carbon burnout rate, these problems are obviated.
      Whilst the extremely small droplet size associated with MSAR™ has distinct advantages for the combustion process, it has disadvantages for the handling and pumping processes because the smaller the droplets, the more viscous the MSAR™. Therefore, in order to further advance emulsion fuel technology, present research, conducted by other organizations, has developed means by which the extremely small droplet size can be maintained whilst simultaneously reducing viscosity leading to improvements in storage, handling and transportation generally. Consequently, research has gone in the direction of bimodal emulsions, i.e. emulsions which have two distinct droplet size peaks in their droplet size profile.
      This is reflected in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,852 issued May 30, 1995 to Rivas, et al and U.S. Pat. No. 5,503,772, issued Apr. 2, 1996 to Rivas et al, inter alia. In these references, specific blends of independently produced and discretely different characteristic emulsions are used to describe the invention. The conclusion is made that the bimodal emulsions can be prepared to reduce viscosity and illustrate that the final emulsion is distinctively bimodal in its physical characteristics.
      Although it is desirable to have a bimodal emulsion, this technology is not without limitation. It is known in the art that the larger the average particle size is, the lower the viscosity of the mixture. Unfortunately, the larger the particles in an emulsified fuel, the greater the length of time it takes for the oil droplet to combust and travel down the furnace which results in the requirement for a longer furnace. In the event that the furnace is of an insufficient length for the selected fuel, then unburnt hydrocarbon material and/or smoke become undesirable attributes. In this manner, the existing technology is limited by the equipment used which can add costs, complications and other problems related to pollution in the overall process.
      Given the state of the art, it has now been recognized that the viscosity drives the overall system towards bigger oil droplets in the fuel, while the combustion results in the driving of the system towards smaller oil droplets. Accordingly, it would be desirable to have a formulation that results in the change in the particle size distribution of the fuel emulsion to reduce viscosity, but also to improve combustion. These latter two properties are most desirable to provide a very efficient high enthalpy emulsified fuel. Having the formation of an emulsion with the above noted properties as a goal, a novel approach was taken to resolve these properties into an emulsion.
      It was found particularly effective to look at the packing of particles in the prior art and adopt this technology. This approach had not previously been applied to the field of emulsions for the purpose of generating a composite emulsion having the most desirable properties, namely a broad particle distribution composed of n-modal distributions, but maintaining, as far as is practically possible, the n-modal distributions as a single peak or unimodal distribution.
      Representative of the particle packing references was gleaned from the Journal of Computational Physics 202 (2005), 737-764, and particularly an article entitled Neighbor list collision- driven molecular dynamics simulation for non- spherical hard particles. I. Algorithmic details. A general algorithm for a system of particles having relatively small aspect ratios with small variations in size. The article was authorized by Donev et al. A further article by the same author entitled, Neighbor list collision- driven molecular dynamics simulation for non- spherical hard particles. II. Applications to ellipses and ellipsoids, Journal of Computational Physics 202 (2005), 765-793, was also reviewed. Other general references in the spherical packing technology include: the article Modeling the packing of granular media by dissipative particle dynamics on an SGI Origin 2000, using DL — POLY with MPI, Elliott et al; Packing and Viscosity of Concentrated Polydisperse Coal- Water Slurries, Veytsman et al, Energy and Fuels 1998, 12, 1031-1039; Is Random Close Packing of Spheres Well Defined? Physical Review Letters, 6 Mar. 2000, Torquato et al.; and The random packing of heterogeneous propellants, KNOTT et al.
      In view of the prior art in the emulsion field, there still exists a need for an emulsion which facilitates changes in particle size distribution of the fuel emulsion to reduce viscosity, but also one which has improved combustion and does not lead to poor carbon burnout. The technology herein provides for burn optimization of the emulsion.
      By applying the packing models from solid fuel to the instant technology, it was found that the wider the particle size distribution, the lower the viscosity of the emulsion.
      The present invention has now collated the most desirable properties for a fuel emulsion where the final emulsion is effectively a composite emulsion of at least two precursory emulsions and which composite emulsion provides for a unimodal distribution, i.e. a single peak, emulsion as opposed to bimodal distribution which is exemplified in the prior art. Unimodal as used herein, refers to a majority peak with the potential for shoulders, but absent discrete peaks.
      The present invention has successfully unified unrelated technologies to result in a particularly efficient composite fuel emulsion.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      One aspect of the present invention is to provide a substantially improved atomized fuel emulsion, which emulsion is a composite fuel emulsion having very desirable burn properties, calorific value and which can be custom designed for burning in any furnace or burning arrangement which is vastly different from the prior art.
      According to a further aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an emulsified hydrocarbon fuel, comprising a composite of a plurality of hydrocarbon-in-water emulsions, the composite emulsion having a unimodal hydrocarbon particle distribution, the hydrocarbon being present in an amount of between 64% and 90% by volume.
      As noted herein previously with respect to the prior art, high oil content in the oil-in-water emulsion has been recognized previously, however, the emulsion formed in the prior art is bimodal. By making use of the instant technology, not only is the hydrocarbon content exceedingly high, but the viscosity is reduced for the overall system relative to the independent viscosities of the precursor emulsions forming the composite and further, the carbon burnout rate is particularly attractive at greater than four nine effectiveness.
      The precursor emulsions may contain the same hydrocarbon material or different hydrocarbon materials depending upon the specific use of the emulsion. In addition, the particle size distributions and droplet size may be the same or different. In the instance where the size distributions are the same, the hydrocarbon material will be different in the discrete emulsions. As a further possibility, the composite emulsion may be a composite emulsion combined with a hydrocarbon in water emulsion. Similar to that noted above, the composite emulsion and hydrocarbon in water may comprise the same or different hydrocarbon material, same or different droplet size and/or the same or different particle size distribution.
      According to a further aspect of one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of formulating a composite emulsion made from different hydrocarbon materials which possess widely differing viscosities and therefore widely differing emulsion preparation temperatures. Consequently, the precursor emulsion which is made at the lower temperature can be used as a cooling agent when mixed with the precursor emulsion which is made at the higher temperature. This obviates or reduces the need to use heat exchangers to reduce the temperature of emulsions which are made above 100 deg C. to below 100 deg C. prior to storage.
      According to a further aspect of one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of formulating a composite emulsion having unimodal particle distribution with reduced viscosity relative to precursor emulsions used to form said composite emulsion: providing a system having an n-modal particle distribution; forming a precursor emulsion for each n-modal distribution present in the system, each precursor emulsion having a characteristic viscosity; and mixing precursor emulsions to form the composite emulsion with a unimodal size distribution and reduced viscosity relative to each precursor emulsion.
      As briefly discussed herein previously, it has been found that by making use of the composite emulsion, the same has a viscosity which readily facilitates transportation, despite the high content of hydrocarbon material present in the emulsion. It is believed this is due to the unimodal particle size distribution which, inherently provides a broader spectrum of particle sizes. This, in turn, commensurately provides advantage in mixture viscosity.
      A still further aspect of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a method for transporting viscous hydrocarbon material comprising: providing a source of hydrocarbon material; generating a plurality of emulsions of the hydrocarbon material, each emulsion having a characteristic viscosity, each emulsion having a different particle size distribution; mixing the plurality of emulsions in a predetermined ratio to form a composite emulsion having a lower viscosity relative to the plurality of emulsions; and mobilizing the composite emulsion.
      A still further aspect of one embodiment of the present invention is a method of maximizing viscous hydrocarbon content in an aqueous system for storage or transport, comprising: providing a hydrocarbon emulsion having a hydrocarbon internal phase volume sufficiently high such that the droplets in the emulsion are aspherical; converting the emulsion at least to a bimodal emulsion system; forming at least two precursor emulsions from the system; mixing the precursor emulsions in a predetermined ratio to effect reduced viscosity; and synthesizing a composite emulsion from the precursor emulsions having the reduced viscosity.
      A still further aspect of one embodiment of the present invention is a method of formulating a composite emulsion having unimodal particle distribution with reduced viscosity relative to precursor emulsions: providing a system having an n-modal particle distribution; forming a precursor emulsion for each modal distribution present in the system; each the precursor emulsion having a characteristic viscosity; forming a plurality of composite emulsions each having a unimodal size distribution and reduced viscosity relative to each the precursor emulsions; and mixing the composite emulsions to form an amalgamated composite emulsion having a unimodal particle distribution and reduced viscosity relative to the viscosity of the composite emulsions.
      In accordance with another beneficial aspect of one embodiment of the present invention, it was found that the HIPR (High Internal Phase Ratio) emulsions, which have extremely high hydrocarbon material content in the emulsion, could also be transported efficiently. By making use of the high internal phase ratio emulsion, it was discovered that these emulsions can be converted to at least a bimodal or n-modal emulsion system depending upon the number of particle size distributions within the HIPR emulsion and then these individual bimodal emulsions could be formed into precursor emulsions and mixed to form a composite emulsion in accordance with the methodology previously discussed herein. In this matter, aspherical or substantially non-spherical oil in water particles can be reconfigured or converted into discreet modes for individual emulsion synthesis with subsequent mixing for composition of a more favorably transportable composite emulsion. This has particular utility in permitting mobilization of high hydrocarbon content material without expensive unit operations conventionally attributed to processes in the prior art such as pre-heating, the addition of diluents or other viscosity reducing agents. The material can simply be converted, to a composite emulsion and once so converted, inherently has the same transportation advantages of the composite emulsions discussed herein previously.
      A method of modifying at least one of the combustion, storage and transportation characteristics of an emulsion during at least one of pre-formation, at formation and post formation, comprising: providing an emulsion; treating the emulsion to a unit selected from the groups consisting of additive addition, mechanical processing, chemical processing, physical processing and combinations thereof; and modifying at least one characteristic of the characteristics of the emulsion from treatment.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002515108,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Depression, including major depression affects approximately 20-25% of women and 7-12% of men in Western countries at some point in their lifetime. Depression is the most common mental disease and the fourth most important cause of disability worldwide. It is expected that rates of depression in the population will increase in the future. Many patients remain undiagnosed and undertreated due to social stigma associated with psychiatric treatments, inappropriate training of general practitioners for the diagnosis of the disease, or low awareness between patients and doctors of depression as a treatable illness.
       Hypersecretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, has been reported in depressed patients, suggesting that cytokine-mediated pathways could be involved in the etiopathogenesis of depression (Levine, J. et al. Neuropsychobiology 40, 171-6 (1999); Sluzewska, A. et al. Indicators of immune activation in major depression. Psychiatry Res 64, 161-7 (1996)). Patients with major depression have higher levels of TNF-α, C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count than control patients (Tuglu et al. Psychopharmacology ( Berl) 170, 429-33 (2003)). Two independent clinical studies by Penninx et al. ( Biol Psychiatry 54, 566-72 (2003)) and Trzonkowski et al. ( Brain Behav Immun 18, 135-48 (2004)) also reported an association between high levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6 and CRP) and depressed mood in aged patients, suggesting that depressed mood causes and/or is caused by systemic inflammation (Pennix, supra and Trzonkowski supra). Increased serum TNF-α concentrations have also been associated with both major depression disorder and multiple sclerosis (Mikova et al. Eur Neuropsychopharmacol 11, 203-8 (2001)). Increased levels of cytokines in depressed patients can be normalized after chronic antidepressant treatment with serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (Tuglu et al. Psychopharmacology ( Berl) 170,429-33 (2003)).
       Despite different treatments for depression there are still several unmet needs and room from improvements for medications including improved efficacy, better tolerability, rapid onset of action and prevention of relapse and recurrence of depressive episodes. Current drug therapies are effective in only 50-70% of patients. Among responders, about 50% do not achieve full remission, 55-60% of patients experience recurrence within 5 years of the treatment and 80% suffer a recurrence within 15 years. Important progress in the treatment of affective disorders has been achieved since the serendipitous finding of monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOi (isoniazid and iproniazid) originally developed for the treatment of tuberculosis in 1951, the discovery of tricyclics antidepressants in the 1960s, and more recently the SSRIs or other compounds with a less defined pharmacology. Current antidepressant drugs are mainly based on the monoamine hypothesis of depression. SSRIs represent the first line of treatment. However, although these compounds are safer and with less side effect than other antidepressants, no improvement in terms of efficacy, onset of action or prevention of relapse has been observed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200300642,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       Advances in the technological armamentarium available to basic and clinical investigators have enabled increasingly sophisticated studies of brain and nervous system function in health and disease. Numerous hypotheses both neurobiological and pharmacological have been advanced with respect to the neurochemical and genetic mechanisms involved in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. However, CNS disorders have complex and poorly understood etiologies, as well as symptoms that are overlapping, poorly characterized, and difficult to measure. As a result, future treatment regimes and drug development efforts will be required to be more sophisticated and focused on multigenic causes, and will need new assays to segment disease populations, and provide more accurate diagnostic and prognostic information on patients suffering from CNS disorders.
       CNS disorders can encompass a wide range of disorders, and a correspondingly wide range of genetic factors. Examples of CNS disorders include neurodegenerative disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, autism, substance dependence and alcoholism, pain disorders, epilepsy, mental retardation, and other psychiatric diseases including cognitive, anxiety, eating, impulse-control, and personality disorders. Disorders can be defined using the Diagnosis and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV) classification.
       Even when considering just a small subset of CNS disorders, it is evident from the lack of adequate treatment for and understanding of the molecular basis of the disorders schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that new targets for therapeutic invention and improved methods of treatment are needed For both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, all of the currently known molecules used for their treatment have side effects and act only against the symptoms of the disease. There is thus a strong need for new molecules without associated side effects and directed against targets which are involved in the causal mechanisms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Therefore, tools facilitating the discovery and characterization of these targets are necessary and useful.
       Voltage Gated Ion Channels
       Voltage gated ion channels are part of a large family of macromolecules whose functions include the control and maintenance of electric potential across cell mambrances, secretion and signal transduction. These channel proteins are involved in the control of neurotransmitter release from neurons, and play an important role in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions, including membrane excitability, muscle contraction and synaptic transmission. The main alpha-subunits of Na+ channels and the alpha-1 subunits of the Ca+ channels consist of approximately 2000 amino acids and contain the ion conduction pathway. Biochemical analysis has revealed that the physiologically active ion channel is composed of several different subunits. There are two auxiliary subunits that copurify with the alpha subunit of Na+ channels, the beta-1 and beta-2 subunit. For Ca+ channels, additional subunits (alpha-2, beta, gamma and sigma) have been identified with modulatory action. The alpha-2 and beta-subunits appear to enhance the functional activity of the alpha-1 subunit of Ca+ channels. The alpha-subunits of K+ channels are associated with beta subunits in a 1:1 fashion resulting in a K+ channel complex exhibiting (alpha)4(beta)4 stoichiometry (Terlau et al., Naturwissenschaften 85:437-444 (1998)). The basic structure and examples of calcium and sodium ion channels are further discussed, e.g., in Williams, et al. Science 257:389-395 (1992); Mori, et al., Nature 350:398-402 (1991); and Koch, et al., J.Biol.Chem. 265 (29):17786-17791 (1990). A Ca+ and Na+ ion channel nucleic acid sequence from the rat sharing a high level of sequence homology with the CanIon channel is further described in Lee et al., FEBS Lett. 445 231:236 (1999).
       The alpha subunit shares sequence characteristics with all voltage-dependent cation channels, and exploits the same structural motif comprising a 6-helix bundle of potential membrane spanning domains. In both sodium and calcium channels, this motif is repeated 4 times within the sequence to give a 24-helix bundle. The amino acid sequences are highly conserved among species (e.g., human and Drosophila), and among different ion channels.
       There are several tissue-specific pharmacologically and electrophysiologically distinct isoforms of calcium channels, coded for by separate genes in a multi-gene family. In skeletal muscle, each tightly-bound assembly of alpha, beta and gamma subunits associates with 4 others to form a pentameric macromolecule. For example, neuronal calcium channel alpha-1 subunits are the product of at least seven different genes named alpha-1 A to H. Immunocytochemical sudies have shown differential distribution of alpha-1 calcium channel subunits. Alpha-1A and alpha-1B are expressed mainly in dendrites and presynaptic terminals, and alpha-1A is generally concentrated in a larger number of nerve terminals than is alpha-1B. In the rat and human neuromuscular junction, alpha-1A is localized presynaptically, while alpha-1B and alpha-1A are both present in axon-associated Schwann cells. Alpha-1E is localized mainly in cell bodies, in some cases in proximal dendrites, as well as in the distal branches of Purkinje cells. Alpha-1C and alpha-1D are localized in cell bodies and in proximal dendrites of central neurons.
       Native calcium channels have been classified based on their pharmacological and/or electrophysiological propoerties. The classification of voltage dependent cacium channels divides them into high voltage-activated (HVA), including L-, N-, P- and Q-types; intermediate (IVA, R-type); and low voltage-activated (LVA, T-type). (Morena et al., Annals NY Acad. Sci. 102-117 (1999).
       The principal subunits (alpha-1) belong to a gene family whose members can form functional channels by themselves when expressed in heterologous expression systems. (Zhang et al., Neuropharmacology 32 (11): 1075-1088 (1993), incorporated herein by reference). In native cells, alpha-1 subunits are expressed as multisubunit complexes with ancillary subunits which modify the functional properties of the alpha-1 subunit. In many cases, coexpression of auxiliary subunits affects the biophysical properties of the channels. Beta subunits in particular tend to have important effects on the alpha-1 subunits; beta subunits have been shown to alter activation properties, steady state inactivation, inactivation kinetics and peak current.
       Much of the molecular diversity of channels is produced by the existence of multiple forms of alpha-1 subunits. For example, it has been shown that differently spliced forms of calcium channels are differentially expressed and have different sensitivities to phosphorylation by serine-threonine kinases (Hell et al., Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci. 747:282-293 (1994)). Mutations in ion channel genes have been shown to be involved in a wide range of diseases, including several central nervous system diseases. Examles of ion channel mutations causing a number of eposodic disorders inclduing periodic paralysis, eposodic ataxia, migraine, long QT syndrome and paroxysmal dyskenesia are reviewed in Bulman et al., Hum. Mol. Gen. 6(10) 1679-1685 (1997). Several Ca+ channel mutation disorders, for example, are shown in Table A (from Moreno, supra).

           Modulators of calcium and sodium channels are also commonly used in the treatment of various diseases and conditions. For example, calcium and/or sodium channel blockers have been shown to be useful for the treatment or prevention of one or more symptoms associated with various diseases or conditions such as various heart diseases and conditions (e.g., angina, arrythmias), hypertension, migraines, neurological effects of strokes, mania, neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia, bipolar disorder, pain, epilepsy, and others.
       It has been shown that significant functional differences in the nervous system exist between different ion channels. In addition, functional differences exist between different mutations in the same ion channel gene as well as between splice variants of the same ion channel. Thus, despite the implication of ion channels in CNS disease, it has been difficult to predict which ion channel may be an effective target for therapeutic intervention for a particular disease. One problem has been to provide an ion channel gene implicated in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or diseases related thereto.
       The present invention addresses these and other needs.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002478645,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
      The tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily, has biological activities of modulating immunological response, cell apoptosis, cell differentiation, and the like. TNFα has two intracellular receptors, TNF receptor 1 (TNFRp55) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFRp75). Overproduction of TNFα is an underlying mechanism of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Blocking excess TNFa by its antagonists including soluble TNFRp75:Fc fusion proteins such as Etanercept and anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies such as Infliximab has been validated as an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.
      Etanercept can bind both TNFα and lymphotoxin (LT), but it requires a relatively large clinical dose at about 25-50 mg, which tends to cause erythema when administered via subcutaneous injection. Therefore, it is highly demanded to develop a TNFRp75 which can bind TNF and lymphotoxin with high affinity, and in turn to develop a TNFRp75:Fc fusion protein as an antibody drug.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      One of the objectives of the present invention is to provide a soluble receptor having a high neutralizing activity to TNFα and/or lymphotoxin, thereby reducing dose of the soluble receptor required for neutralizing TNFα, improving therapeutic effect on autoimmune diseases and decreasing production cost of the drug.
      Another objective of the present invention is to provide a fusion protein formed between a soluble receptor having a higher neutralizing activity and an additional amino acid fragment.
      Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a DNA sequence encoding the soluble receptor or the fusion protein stated above.
      Still another objective of the present invention is to provide use of a soluble receptor having a higher neutralizing activity to TNFα and/or lymphotoxin or a fusion protein thereof in pharmaceuticals.
      Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising the soluble receptor or a fusion protein thereof stated above.
      Inventors of the present invention have made intensive studies on the structures of TNF receptor 2, TNFα and LT through molecular structure modeling and found that the amino acid at position 92 of the TNF receptor 2 is essential for its binding with TNFα and LT. Then, the inventors made a rational point mutation at the amino acid position 92 and obtained a soluble mutant of TNF receptor 2, which has a high neutralizing activity to TNFα and lymphotoxin.
      In the first aspect, the present invention discloses a soluble TNFRp75 mutant that has an amino acid substitution at the amino acid position 92 of the wild-type sequence (SEQ ID NO. 1). The neutralizing activity of the soluble TNFRp75 mutant against the cytotoxicity of TNFα and lymphotoxin is increased by above 30% when compared with the wild type.
      In a preferred embodiment, the glutamic acid residue (E) at the amino acid position 92 is substituted by one of Asn, His, Ser, Ala, Lys or Gln. That is, the amino acid E at position 92 of the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO. 1 is substituted by N, H, S, A, K or Q, respectively. The exemplary examples are as follows.
      The amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92H) mutant is set forth in SEQ ID NO. 2, wherein the position 92 is Histidine (His), and the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-22 are a signal peptide.

      The amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92N) mutant is set forth in SEQ ID NO. 4, wherein the position 92 is Asparagine (Asn), and the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-22 are a signal peptide.
      The amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92S) mutant is set forth in SEQ ID NO. 5, wherein the position 92 is Serine (Ser), and the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-22 are a signal peptide.
      In some preferred embodiments, the Tryptophan (Trp) at position 89 is further substituted by Tyr, Phe, His, Lys, Met or Leu, in addition to the substitution of Glu (E) at position 92. The exemplary examples are as follows.
      The amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92N, W89Y) mutant is set forth in SEQ ID NO. 6, wherein the position 89 is Tyrosine (Tyr), position 92 is Asparagine (Asn), and the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-22 are a signal peptide.
      The amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92S, W89Y) mutant is set forth in SEQ ID NO. 7, wherein the position 89 is Tyrosine (Tyr), position 92 is Serine (Ser), and the N-terminal amino acid residues 1-22 are a signal peptide.

      In the second aspect, the present invention discloses a fusion protein comprising a soluble TNFRp75 mutant and an additional amino acid fragment. Said additional amino acid fragment acts to enhance the stability and improve the biological half-life of the TNFRp75 mutant.
      Said additional amino acid fragment is selected from the group consisting of the human immunoglobulin (IgG) constant region (Fc) and one of the five functional regions of Albumin.
      Said additional amino acid fragment is at the C-terminus of the TNFRp75 mutant.
      In a preferred embodiment, said additional amino acid fragment is the 232 amino acid residues of human immunoglobulin (IgG) constant region (Fc). A fusion protein is formed by the soluble TNFRp75 mutant and the 232 amino acids of the Fc fragment at the C-terminus of human IgG, with or without an additional connecting fragment between the two components, preferably without an additional connecting fragment. The exemplary examples are as follows:
      the amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92H): Fc set forth in SEQ ID NO. 9;
      the amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92A): Fc set forth in SEQ ID NO. 10;
      the amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92N): Fc set forth in SEQ ID NO. 11;
      the amino acid sequence of TNFRp75 (E92S): Fc set forth in SEQ ID NO. 12;

As well known in the art, the DNA sequences encoding the soluble receptors or the fusion proteins according to the present invention may vary according to codon degeneracy and codon bias of different host cells, but these DNA sequences still fall into the scope of the present invention, as long as the amino acid sequences encoded by these DNA sequences do not change.
      In the fourth aspect, the present invention discloses use of the soluble TNFRp75 mutant or a fusion protein thereof stated above in pharmaceuticals, in particular, in the treatment of diseases associated with over-expression of TNFα and/or lymphotoxin, including but not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome.
      In the fifth aspect, the present invention discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising the soluble TNFRp75 mutant or a fusion protein thereof stated above.
      The TNFRp75 mutants and the fusion proteins thereof in the present invention have an increased binding capacity to TNF and lymphotoxin. For example, the neutralizing activity of the soluble TNFRp75 (E92N): Fc to TNFα is 1.33 times that of the wild-type soluble TNFRp75: Fc (ENBREL from AMGEN), and the neutralizing activity to LT is 2.77 times that of the wild-type soluble TNFRp75: Fc (ENBREL from AMGEN). The TNFRp75 mutant and the fusion protein thereof in the present invention are useful in the treatment of diseases related to TNFα and LT. Because of the increased activity, the clinical dose could be reduced so as to decrease the probability of rising erythema when the drug is administered via subcutaneous injection. In addition, increase of the dissociation time in terms of TNFα binding will be advantageous for an extended action time of the drug.

      Nowadays, cardio-cerebrovascular disease is one of the main diseases threatening human health, among which brain stroke leads to an extraordinarily high mortality rate. The main pathological symptoms thereof include: (1) the formation of cerebral hematoma, (2) cerebral thrombosis, (3) cerebral ischemia, and (4) the occurrence of cerebral edema. At present, above pathological symptoms are considered to be associated with leukocyte infiltration, thrombin activation and microcirculation disorders. It is known that neutrophil inhibitory factor and hirudin can inhibit leukocyte infiltration and thrombin activation, respectively (Moyle M et al: U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,175; Madden Ketal, Inflamm Res 1997, 46(6):216-223; Masadda T. et al, Brain Res, 2000, 867(2):173-179.). Neutrophil inhibitory factor (NIF) consists of 257 amino acids and contains seven glycosylation sites. It has been proved that recombinant deglycosylated NIF retains the biological activities. NIF can effectively inhibit neutrophil activities including adhesion to endothelial cells, release of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide ions, as well as chemotaxis, aggregation and phagocytosis of neutrophil, etc (Moyle M et al: J Biol chem 1994, 269(13):10008-10015). In view of the above efficacies of NIF, it is demonstrated in the animal model that recombinant NIF has clinical values on preventing and treating ischemic neural injury (rat MCAO model), improving blood supply during brain injury, and alleviating brain tissue injury area (Zhang L et al: stroke. 2003, 34(7):1790-1795).
      It is found that the C-terminal dodecapeptide (i.e. 53 rd-64 th amino acids) of the hirudin possesses all the functions as hirudin antithrombin activities by investigating the structure and function of hirudin (Naski M C. et al: J Biocchem. 1990, 265(23):13484-13489; Maraganore J metal: Biochemistry. 1990, 29(30):7095-7101). An artificial dodecapeptide is synthesized artificially based on above results, denominated as hirugen. It is proved that hirugen can bind to the anion-binding region of thrombin, but can not bind to the catalytic site region and fibrin. Thrombin can bind to fibrin, so hirugen can not specifically bind to thrombin, i.e., hirugen can not target to thrombin. However, hirugen can inhibit thrombin both in vivo and in vitro to convert fibrinogen to fibrin, and elongate APTT, PT and TT, thus achieving anticoagulation effect.
      Upon above pathological studies and biological activities of NIF and hirugen, Chinese patent application (Application No. 031011551) discloses a bifunctional chimeric protein (NIF-hirudin hybrid, or NHH for short) derived from NIF and hirugen by genetic recombination technique. The chimeric protein is represented as NIF-(Gly) 5 (SEQ ID No: 10)-hirugen. The NHH consists of 274 amino acids, and possesses the functions of inhibiting the adhesion and activation of neutrophil, as well as inhibiting thrombin activity, thus being suitable for treating acute cerebrovascular diseases. Unfortunately, since the hirugen contained in the NHH can not bind to the catalytic site region, the NHH can not target to thrombin, which greatly decreases the therapeutic efficacy of NHH on cardio-cerebrovascular disease.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      To overcome the disadvantages in the prior art, the invention aims to provide a novel recombinant chimeric protein of neutrophil inhibitory factor and hirugen, capable of targeting inhibition of thrombin activity, thus improving the therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular disease, such as brain stroke.
      For achieving above purposes, the invention in the first aspect provides a recombinant chimeric protein of neutrophil inhibitory factor and hirugen (TNHH) with the following structure: Met-NIF-linker 1-FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11)-linker 2-hirugen, or NIF-linker 1-FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11)-linker 2-hirugen. Preferably, the linker 1 is 5-15 glycines, and more preferably is 5-10 glycines; and the linker 2 is (GSGG) n, n=1-3 (SEQ ID No: 12-14).
      In the second aspect, the invention provides a polynucleotide sequence encoding the recombinant chimeric protein of neutrophil inhibitory factor and hirugen.
      In the third aspect, the invention provides an expression vector comprising the polynucleotide sequence.
      In the fourth aspect, the invention provides a microorganism comprising the expression vector.
      In the fifth aspect, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the recombinant chimeric protein of neutrophil inhibitory factor and hirugen.
      The TNHH according to this invention has the structure of: Met-NIF-linker 1-FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11)-linker 2-hirugen, or NIF-linker 1-FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11)-linker 2-hirugen. Preferably, linker 1 of TNHH is 5-15 glycines, more preferably 5-10 glycines; and the linker 2 is (GSGG) n, wherein n=1-3 (SEQ ID No: 12-14), more preferably n=1. Within the FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11), phenylalanine (F) is preferably in L-form; and Met stands for methionine. Preferably, the chimeric protein is Met-NIF(257)-(Gly) 5-FPRPGSGG (SEQ ID No: 15)-Hirugen, wherein phenylalanine (F) in the FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11) is in L-form.
      The TNHH according to this invention also includes an amino acid sequence sharing about 80% or more, preferably 90% or more identity with the amino acid sequence of Met-NIF-linker 1-FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11)-linker 2-hirugen, or NIF-linker 1-FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11)-linker 2-hirugen, and having therapeutic activity for cardio-cerebrovascular disease, such as brain stroke. Typically, a higher value is preferred for the identity value. The identity of the amino acid sequences can be determined by the BLAST Algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87: 2264-2268, 1990; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5873, 1993).
      The FPRP (SEQ ID No: 11) structure within TNHH can specifically bind to fibrin, rendering TNHH targeting for inhibition of thrombin activity and treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular disease.
      Furthermore, the TNHH according to this invention has an excellent behavior on treating or preventing cardio-cerebrovascular disease, such as treating or preventing brain ischemic injury or cerebral hematoma, and has a notable progress on inhibiting platelet aggregation or inhibiting peripheral leukocyte activation. The cardio-cerebrovascular disease is preferably brain stroke.
      To prepare TNHH, the invention takes following steps: (1) designing a cDNA sequence corresponding to NHH to be artificially synthesized, based on the cDNA of NIF from GenBank and the codon sequence deduced from the hirugen dodecapeptide, in combination with the preferable codons of Escherichia coli, yeast or CHO, (2) designing plural pairs of complementary over-lapped primers based on above-designed cDNA sequence, amplifying the cDNA sequence by a recursive PCR, inserting the amplified product into the sequencing plasmid pUC57, and sequencing with an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI) for ensuring the identity between the designed cDNA sequence and the artificially synthesized cDNA sequence, (3) designing primers by use of pUC57 comprising the base sequence designed in step (2) as a template for amplifying TNHH gene, and in the amplified gene, the front region and the terminal region comprise cleavage sites, respectively, and the terminal region additionally comprises a terminator, preferably a TAATGA terminator, in the front of the cleavage site, for conveniently inserting the amplified gene into an expression vector and expressing the expression vector in host cells; the cleavage sites of Nde I and BanH I are respectively preferred in the front region and the terminal region for conveniently inserting the amplified gene into prokaryotic expression vector pET-3c, (4) using a sequencing plasmid with the same cleavage sites as the amplified TNHH gene for detecting the identity between the designed sequence and the amplified TNHH gene, as the amplified TNHH gene comprise cleavage sites in the front region and the terminal region, subsequently cleaving the sequencing plasmid comprising the correct TNHH gene and an expression vector, and ligating the correct TNHH gene to the expression vector to obtain the expression vector comprising TNHH gene, and (5) transforming a host cell with the expression vector comprising TNHH gene, performing sequencing analysis on the transformant host cell for ensuring the correct insertion of TNHH gene and identity between the designed sequence and the target gene sequence, expressing the TNHH protein in the host cell, and extracting and purifying the TNHH protein from the host cell. The TNHH protein sequence consists of NIF, linkers and hirugen, wherein the NIF sequence is located at N-terminal and consists of 274 amino acids. According to examples 1-7, the expression vector for preparing recombinant TNHH is PET system expressed in E. coli. When expressing in prokaryotic organisms, the start codon ATG at the 5′-terminal of the recombinant TNHH is translated into methionine (Met). Thus, the recombinant TNHH product expressed by E. coli is met-TNHH. When the same TNHH polynucleotide sequence is expressed in eukaryotic expression systems, such as yeast, mammalian cell (CHO) and like, the recombinant TNHH product is free of Met at N-terminal. In this invention, the biological effects and pharmacodynamic efficacies of TNHH are independent of Met at the N terminal of the recombinant TNHH product obtained by expressing the amino acid sequence of TNHH according to this invention in prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms.
      The invention also provides polynucleotide sequences encoding the recombinant chimeric protein of neutrophil inhibitory factor and hirugen, among which the polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO: 2 is preferred.
      Preferably, the expression vector comprising the polynucleotide according to present invention is pET system.
      The host cells comprising the expression vector according to present invention include E. coli, yeast cell, and CHO cells, etc., among which E. coli is preferred.
      The pharmaceutical composition according to present invention can be any conventional dosage forms administrated by any conventional delivery routes, among which parenteral administration is preferred. The preferable dosage form is injection formulation, including injection solution, lyophilized powder for injecting, etc. When preparing the injection formulation, the TNHH according to present invention is added to a certain amount of an inorganic salt or an amino acid buffer, such as phosphate, acetate, carbonate, citrate, glycine, histidine, wherein the salt is preferably sodium salt, and the ionic strength thereof is in the range of 5-100 mmol/L. The pH value of the pharmaceutical composition is in the range of 5.0-9.0. A protein protector, such as albumin, gelatin, polysaccharide, starch, glycerol and the like, can also be added into the composition, wherein the polysaccharide is selected from one or more of mannitol, sucrose and trehalose to a concentration (g/ml) of 2.0-6.0%.
      The pharmaceutical composition comprising TNHH according to present invention can be used for treating cardio-cerebrovascular disease, especially brain stroke.

1. Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to the area of recombinant technology. In some aspects, it concerns simplified and efficient methods of generating recombinant adenovirus. In other aspects, novel compositions and methods involving p53 adenovirus constructs are provided, including methods for restoring normal p53 functions and growth suppression to cells with abnormal p53.
2. Description of Related Art
Current treatment methods for cancer, including radiation therapy, surgery, and chemotherapy, are known to have limited effectiveness. Lung cancer alone kills more than 140,000 people annually in the United States. Recently, age-adjusted mortality from lung cancer has surpassed that from breast cancer in women. Although implementation of smoking-reduction programs has decreased the prevalence of smoking, lung cancer mortality rates will remain high well into the 21st century. The rational development of new therapies for lung cancer will depend on an understanding of the biology of lung cancer at the molecular level.
It is now well established that a variety of cancers are caused, at least in part, by genetic abnormalities that result in either the over expression of one or more genes, or the expression of an abnormal or mutant gene or genes. For example, in many cases, the expression of oncogenes is known to result in the development of cancer. ""Oncogenes"" are genetically altered genes whose mutated expression product somehow disrupts normal cellular function or control (Spandidos et al., 1989).
Most oncogenes studied to date have been found to be ""activated"" as the result of a mutation, often a point mutation, in the coding region of a normal cellular gene, i.e., a ""proto-oncogene"", that results in amino acid substitutions in the expressed protein product. This altered expression product exhibits an abnormal biological function that takes part in the neoplastic process (Travali et al., 1990). The underlying mutations can arise by various means, such as by chemical mutagenesis or ionizing radiation. A number of oncogenes and oncogene families, including ras, ntyc, neu, raf, erb, src, fins, jun and abl, have now been identified and characterized to varying degrees (Travali et al., 1990; Bishop, 1987).
During normal cell growth, it is thought that growth-promoting proto-oncogenes are counterbalanced by growth-constraining tumor suppressor genes. Several factors may contribute to an imbalance in these two forces, leading to the neoplastic state. One such factor is mutations in tumor suppressor genes (Weinberg, 1991).
An important tumor suppressor gene is the gene encoding the cellular protein, p53, which is a 53 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that controls cell proliferation. Mutations to the p53 gene and allele loss on chromosome 17p, where this gene is located, are among the most frequent alterations identified in human malignancies. The p53 protein is highly conserved through evolution and is expressed in most normal tissues. Wild-type p53 has been shown to be involved in control of the cell cycle (Mercer, 1992), transcriptional regulation (Fields et al., 1990, and Mietz et al., 1992), DNA replication (Wilcock and Lane, 1991, and Bargonetti et al., 1991), and induction of apoptosis (Yonish-Rouach et al., 1991, and, Shaw et al., 1992).
Various mutant p53 alleles are known in which a single base substitution results in the synthesis of proteins that have quite different growth regulatory properties and, ultimately, lead to malignancies (Hollstein et al., 1991). In fact, the p53 gene has been found to be the most frequently mutated gene in common human cancers (Hollstein et al., 1991; Weinberg, 1991), and is particularly associated with those cancers linked to cigarette smoke (Hollstein et al., 1991; Zakut-Houri et al., 1985). The overexpression of p53 in breast tumors has also been documented (Casey et al., 1991).
One of the most challenging aspects of gene therapy for cancer relates to utilization of tumor suppressor genes, such as p53. It has been reported that transfection of wild-type p53 into certain types of breast and lung cancer cells can restore growth suppression control in cell lines (Casey et al., 1991; Takahasi et al., 1992). Although DNA transfection is not a viable means for introducing DNA into patients' cells, these results serve to demonstrate that supplying wild type p53 to cancer cells having a mutated p53 gene may be an effective treatment method if an improved means for delivering the p53 gene could be developed.
Gene delivery systems applicable to gene therapy for tumor suppression are currently being investigated and developed. Virus-based gene transfer vehicles are of particular interest because of the efficiency of viruses in infecting actual living cells, a process in which the viral genetic material itself is transferred. Some progress has been made in this regard as, for example, in the generation of retroviral vectors engineered to deliver a variety of genes. However, major problems are associated with using retroviral vectors for gene therapy since their infectivity depends on the availability of retroviral receptors on the target cells, they are difficult to concentrate and purify, and they only integrate efficiently into replicating cells.
Adenovirus vector systems have recently been proposed for use in certain gene transfer protocols, however, the current methods for preparing recombinant adenovirus have several drawbacks. These methods rely on calcium phosphate-mediated transfection of expression vectors and adenoviral plasmids into host cells and subsequent plaque assays on the transfected cells. These types of transfection steps and assays are inefficient and typically result in low levels of viral propagation.
There remains, therefore, a clear need for the development of new methods for introducing tumor suppressor genes, such as p53, into cells as a means for restoring growth suppression. Methods for producing recombinant adenovirus which avoid calcium-phosphate mediated transfection and agarose overlay for plaque assays would also be advantageous.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention addresses the foregoing and other problems by providing efficient methods for producing recombinant adenovirus, such as p53 adenovirus, and effective means by which to restore p53 functions to cells with aberrant p53. Recombinant adenovirus vectors and virions are disclosed, as are methods of using such compositions to promote wild type p53 expression in cells with aberrant p53 functions, such as cancer cells. Also disclosed is a simplified protocol for propagating recombinant adenovirus using liposome-mediated DNA transfection followed by observation of cytopathic effect (CPE) and, preferably, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Furthermore, utilizing this new method for generating and propagating recombinant adenoviruses, it is envisaged that other genes may be incorporated into the virion genome. These genes could include tumor suppressor genes such as the retinoblastoma (rb) gene, antisense oncogenes, i.e. anti-c-myc and anti-k-ras, and other growth control related genes for cancer gene therapy.
Using the present invention the inventors have demonstrated a remarkable effect in controlling metastatic growth. The Ad5CMV-p53 recombinant adenovirus was shown to markedly reduce the growth rate of transformed cells. The virus inhibited tumorigenicity of virus-infected H358 cells. Furthermore it prevented orthotopic lung cancer growth when the virus was instilled intratracheally following the intratracheal inoculation of the H226Br cells. The inhibition of tumorigenicity also suggests that even transient expression of a high-level of the p53 protein may be enough to induce a tumoricidal effect.
In one specific embodiment, this invention concerns vector constructs for introducing wild type p53 genes into target cells, such as target cells suspected of having mutant or aberrant p53 genes, including malignant cell types. These embodiments involve the preparation of a gene expression or transcription unit wherein the p53 gene is placed under the control of a promoter and the unit is incorporated into an adenoviral vector within a recombinant adenovirus. The invention as a whole is surprising and advantageous for several reasons. Firstly, it was previously thought that p53 virus could not be generated into a packaging cell, such as those used to prepare adenovirus, as it would be toxic; secondly, E1B of adenovirus binds to p53 and thus interferes with its function; thirdly, once generated, the p53 adenovirus was found to be unexpectedly effective at inhibiting the growth of various cancer cells; and finally the tumorigenicity of the lung cancer cells was inhibited through the treatment by Ad5CMV-p53 but not a control virus indicating that the novel p53 protein delivery and preparation has astonishing therapeutic efficacy.
The invention therefore concerns adenovirus vector constructs that involve using Adenovirus to carry tumor suppressor genes such as p53, anti-sense oncogenes and other related genes for human cancer therapy. In one embodiment recombinant Adenovirus virions or particles incorporating such vectors, and pharmacological formulations thereof, which comprise a recombinant insert including an expression region encoding wild type p53, by which vectors are capable of expressing p53 in human metastatic cells are encompassed. The p53 expression region in the vector may comprise a genomic sequence, but for simplicity, it is contemplated that one will generally prefer to employ a p53 cDNA sequence as these are readily available in the art and more easily manipulated. The recombinant insert of the vector will also generally comprise a promoter region and a polyadenylation signal, such as an SV40 or protamine gene polyadenylation signal.
In preferred embodiments, it is contemplated that one will desire to position the p53 expression region under the control of a strong constitutive promoter such as a CMV promoter, viral LTR, RSV, or SV40 promoter, or a promoter associated with genes that are expressed at high levels in mammalian cells such as elongation factor-1 or actin promoters. Currently, the most preferred promoter is the cytomegalovirus (CMV) IE promoter.
The p53 gene or cDNA may be introduced into recombinant adenovirus in accordance with the invention simply by inserting or adding the p53 coding sequence into a viral genome which lacks E1B. However, the preferred adenoviruses will be replication defective viruses in which a viral gene essential for replication and/or packaging has been deleted from the adenoviral vector construct, allowing the p53 expression region to be introduced in its place. Any gene in addition to E1B, whether essential (e.g., E1A, E2 and E4) or non-essential (e.g., E3) for replication, may be deleted and replaced with p53.
Particularly preferred are those vectors and virions in which the E1A and E1B regions of the adenovirus vector have been deleted and the p53 expression region introduced in their place, as exemplified by the genome structure of FIG. 1.
Techniques for preparing replication defective adenoviruses are well known in the art, exemplified by Ghosh-Choudhury and Granham (1987); McGrory et al. (1988); and Gluzman et al. (1982), each incorporated herein by reference. It is also well known that various cell lines may be used to propagate recombinant adenoviruses, so long as they complement any replication defect which may be present. A preferred cell line is the human 293 cell line, but any other cell line that is permissive for replication, i.e., in the preferred case, which expresses E1A and E1B may be employed. Further, the cells can be propagated either on plastic dishes or in suspension culture, in order to obtain virus stocks thereof.
The invention is not limited to E1-lacking virus and E1-expressing cells alone. Indeed, other complementary combinations of viruses and host cells may be employed in connection with the present invention, so long as the p53 vector does not have E1B. Virus lacking functional E2 and E2-expressing cells may be used, as may virus lacking functional E4 and E4-expressing cells, and the like. Where a gene which is not essential for replication is deleted and replaced, such as, for example, the E3 gene, this defect will not need to be specifically complemented by the host cell.
Other than the requirement that the adenovirus vectors and virions not have E1B, their nature is not believed to be crucial to the successful practice of the invention. The adenovirus may be of any of the 42 different known serotypes or subgroups A-F. Adenovirus type 5 of subgroup C is the preferred starting material in order to obtain the conditional replication-defective adenovirus vector for use in the method of the present invention. This is because Adenovirus type 5 is a human adenovirus about which there is significant amount of biochemical and genetic information known, and which has historically been used for most constructions employing adenovirus as a vector.
Further related aspects of the invention concern novel p53 DNA segments, or expression vectors, and recombinant host cells which incorporate an adenoviral p53 vector prepared in accordance herewith. The DNA segments of the invention will generally comprise, in the 5'-3' direction of transcription, a cytomegalovirus IE promoter, a structural gene for the wild-type human p53, and an SV40 early polyadenylation signal. The recombinant adenovirus-containing host cell will generally be a eukaryotic or mammalian host cell, such as a 293 cell, or may be a cell with a defect in a p53 gene which has been infected with the adenovirus of the invention.
Other embodiments concern pharmaceutical compositions comprising a recombinant adenovirus which encodes wild type p53, dispersed in a pharmacologically acceptable solution or buffer. Preferred pharmacologically acceptable solutions include neutral saline solutions buffered with phosphate, lactate, Tris, and the like. Of course, one will desire to purify the adenovirus sufficiently to render it essentially free of undesirable contaminants, such as defective interfering adenovirus particles or endotoxins and other pyrogens such that it will not cause any untoward reactions in the animal or individual receiving the vector construct. A preferred means of purifying the vector involves the use of buoyant density gradients, such as cesium chloride gradient centrifugation.
In still further embodiments, the invention relates to a method for providing p53 functions, or restoring wild-type p53 protein functions, to a cell deficient in wild-type p53. To achieve this, one would contact the cell bearing the p53 mutation with an amount of recombinant adenovirus of the invention effective to express wild-type p53 in the cell. This may be achieved by administering a physiologically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the adenovirus to an animal or human subject which harbors cells with defective p53, such as, e.g., cancer cells. Therefore, the present invention also encompasses effective methods for treating human malignancies such as breast and lung cancer.
In another embodiment of the invention the p53 expressing adenovirus is used to prevent malignant and even metastatic growth. In one embodiment the recombinant p53 expressing adenovirus is used to inhibit the uncontrolled growth of cells that have mutations of the p53 gene. In a more preferred embodiment the p53 expressing adenovirus inhibits the tumorigenicity and growth of H358 cells, but any other cell that is an indicator of p53 function may be used.
In a further embodiment the p53 expressing virus is used to prevent orthotopic lung tumor growth when the virus is instilled intratracheally. The Ad5CMV-p53 virus yielded encouraging results in the nude mouse tests. The virus inhibited tumorigenicity of virus-infected H358 cells, a cell that normally produces a significant tumor mass. The virus also prevented orthotopic lung cancer growth when the virus was instilled intratracheally following the intratracheal inoculation of H226Br cells confirming the in vitro effects of Ad5CMV-p53 on the lung cancer cells. The tumorigenicity of the lung cancer cells was inhibited through the treatment by Ad5CMV-p53 but not by the control virus Ad5/RSV/GL2, indicating that the p53 protein has therapeutic efficacy. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that other methods of viral delivery are encompassed by the invention.
While aspects of the invention are exemplified through the use of p53 constructs in connection with restoring normal cell function and for use in cancer treatment, it is proposed that the invention is generally applicable to any situation where one desires to achieve high level expression of a tumor suppressor protein in a target or host cell through the use of recombinant adenovirus. For example, in the context of cancer treatment modalities, a particular example in addition to p53 replacement that is contemplated by the inventors is the introduction of the retinoblastoma gene (rb), anti-sense oncogenes (c-myc or c-ras), and other related genes for human cancer therapy.
It should be pointed out that because the adenovirus vector employed is replication defective, it will not be capable of replicating in the cells, such as cancer cells, that are ultimately infected. Thus, where continued treatment in certain individuals is required, such as at the beginning of therapy, it may be necessary to reintroduce the virus after a certain period, for example, 6 months or a year.
The adenoviral vectors of the present invention will also have utility in embodiments other than those connected directly with gene therapy. Alternative uses include, for example, in vitro analyses and mutagenesis studies of various p53 genes, and the recombinant production of proteins for use, for example, in antibody generation or other embodiments. In embodiments other than those connected with human therapy, including all those concerned with further defining the molecular activity of p53, other related viruses may even be employed to deliver p53 to a cell. Those belonging to the herpes family, e.g., herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) would be suitable.
A different aspect of the present invention concerns simplified procedures for producing any type of recombinant adenovirus which avoid using the inefficient calcium phosphate transfection and tedious plaque assays. To produce recombinant adenovirus in accordance with the present invention, one would generally introduce an adenovirus plasmid and an expression vector into a suitable host cell by liposome-mediated transfection, and then analyze the cultured host cell for the presence of a cytopathic effect (CPE), which is indicative of homologous recombination and virus production. It is the increase in transfection efficiency of the first step which renders the second and advantageous CPE step possible.
A preferred composition for use in the liposome-mediated transfection is DOTAP (N-[1-(2,3-dideoyloxy) propyl]-N,N,N-trimethyl-ammoniummethysulfate) which is commercially available. CPE is a directly observable phenomenon, which may be assessed using phase contrast microscopy. CPE describes the morphologic features of Adenovirus cytotoxicity that begin with the shrinking of the lytically infected cell and conclude with the formation of a lytic plaque. A particular advantage of this method is that viral propagation is readily determined after a 10 to 14 day incubation. This is a significant improvement over the calcium phosphate-mediated transfection and subsequent plaque assays require at least 14 and usually up to a minimum of 21 days, and frequently up to several weeks before the results can be assessed.
In certain embodiments, the method of the invention may be used in connection with adenovirus plasmids which are replication-defective, along with a host cell which complements the defect, as exemplified by E1-lacking plasmids and 293 cells. Adenovirus plasmids which lack functional E1A and E1B and which incorporate a p53 expression region are used herein in working examples of the invention, but any expression region may be incorporated into a recombinant adenovirus in this manner. The precise methodological aspects may be varied as desired; however, it is contemplated that the use of MEM media will be preferred in certain cases.
These new methods may be combined with PCR analysis to confirm the presence of the correctly recombined virus. PCR is well known to those in the art, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195, incorporated herein by reference. To use PCR in connection with the invention, one would obtain DNA from the supernatant of cells exhibiting a cytopathic effect and analyze the DNA by PCR using two pairs of primers, one expression vector-specific and the other adenoviral genome-specific DNA primers. Vector- or insert-specific DNA is, by definition, a gene segment which is part of the DNA encoding the polypeptide or RNA one ultimately desires to be expressed, as illustrated by p53 DNA expression as mRNA and protein production. Adenovirus genome specific DNA may be any part of the genome that is expressed during the stage of propagation being monitored.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200800300,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       The essence of adaptive immunity is the ability of an organism to react to the presence of foreign substances and produce components (antibodies and cells) capable of specifically interacting with and protecting the host from their invasion. An “antigen” or “immunogen” is a substance that is able to elicit this type of immune response and also is capable of interacting with the sensitized cells and antibodies that are manufactured against it.
       Antigens or immunogens are usually macromolecules that contain distinct antigenic sites or “epitopes” that are recognized and interact with the various components of the immune system. They can exist as individual molecules composed of synthetic organic chemicals, proteins, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, RNA, DNA, or polysaccharides, or they may be parts of cellular structures (bacteria or fungi) or viruses (Harlow and Lane 1988a,b,c; Male et al., 1987).
       Small molecules like short peptides, although normally able to interact with the products of an immune response, often cannot cause a response on their own. These peptide immunogens or “hastens” as they are also called, are actually incomplete antigens, and, although not able by themselves to cause immunogenicity or to elicit antibody production, can be made immunogenic by coupling them to a suitable carrier. Carriers typically are protein antigens of higher molecular weight that are able to cause an immunological response when administered in vivo.
       In an immune response, antibodies are produced and secreted by the B-lymphocytes in conjunction with the T-helper (T H) cells. In the majority of hapten-carrier systems, the B cells produce antibodies that are specific for both the hapten and the carrier. In these cases, the T lymphocytes will have specific binding domains on the carrier, but will not recognize the hapten alone. In a kind of synergism, the B and T cells cooperate to induce a hapten-specific antibody response. After such an immune response has taken place, if the host is subsequently challenged with only the hapten, usually it will respond by producing hapten-specific antibodies from memory cells formed after the initial immunization.
       Synthetic haptens mimicking some critical epitopic structures on larger macromolecules are often conjugated to carriers to create an immune response to the larger “parent” molecule. For instance, short peptide segments can be synthesized from the known sequence of a protein and coupled to a carrier to induce immunogenicity toward the native protein. This type of synthetic approach to the immunogen production has become the basis of much of the current research into the creation of vaccines. However, in many instances, merely creating a B-cell response by using synthetic peptide-carrier conjugates, however well designed, will not always guarantee complete protective immunity toward an intact antigen. The immune response generated by a short peptide epitope from a larger viral particle or bacterial cell may only be sufficient to generate memory at the B cell level. In these cases it is generally now accepted that a cytotoxic T-cell response is a more important indicator of protective immunity. Designing peptide immunogens with the proper epitopic binding sites for both B-cell and T-cell recognition is one of the most challenging research areas in immunology today.
       The approach to increasing immunogenicity of small or poorly immunogenic molecules by conjugating these molecules to large “carrier” molecules has been utilized successfully for decades (see, e.g., Goebel et al. (1939) J. Exp. Med. 69: 53). For example, many immunogenic compositions have been described in which purified capsular polymers have been conjugated to carrier proteins to create more effective immunogenic compositions by exploiting this “carrier effect.” Schneerson et al. (1984) Infect. Immun. 45: 582-591). Conjugation has also been shown to bypass the poor antibody response usually observed in infants when immunized with a free polysaccharide (Anderson et al. (1985) J. Pediatr. 107: 346; Insel et al. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 158: 294).
       Hapten-carrier conjugates have been successfully generated using various cross-linking/coupling reagents such as homobifunctional, heterobifunctional, or zero-length cross linkers. Many such methods are currently available for coupling of saccharides, proteins, and peptides to peptide carriers. Most methods create amine, amide, urethane, isothiourea, or disulfide bonds, or in some cases thioethers. A disadvantage to the use of coupling reagents, which introduce reactive sites in to the side chains of reactive amino acid molecules on carrier and/or hapten molecules, is that the reactive sites if not neutralized are free to react with any unwanted molecule either in vitro (thus adversely affecting the functionality or stability of the conjugate(s)) or in vivo (thus posing a potential risk of adverse events in persons or animals immunized with the preparations). Such excess reactive sites can be reacted or “capped”, so as to inactivate these sites, utilizing various known chemical reactions, but these reactions may be otherwise disruptive to the functionality of the conjugates. This may be particularly problematic when attempting to create a conjugate by introducing the reactive sites into the carrier molecule, as its larger size and more complex structure (relative to the hapten) may render it more vulnerable to the disruptive effects of chemical treatment. In fact, no examples are known of methods whereby a conjugate is made by first activating the carrier, then reacting with the hapten in a conjugation reaction, and finally “capping” the remaining reactive sites, while preserving the ability of the resulting conjugate to function as an immunogenic composition having the desired properties of the “carrier effect”.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200601169,"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
       The essence of adaptive immunity is the ability of an organism to react to the presence of foreign substances and produce components (antibodies and cells) capable of specifically interacting with and protecting the host from their invasion. An “antigen” or “immunogen” is a substance that is able to elicit this type of immune response and also is capable of interacting with the sensitized cells and antibodies that are manufactured against it.
       Antigens or immunogens are usually macromolecules that contain distinct antigenic sites or “epitopes” that are recognized and interact with the various components of the immune system. They can exist as individual molecules composed of synthetic organic chemicals, proteins, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, RNA, DNA, or polysaccharides, or they may be parts of cellular structures (bacteria or fungi) or viruses (Harlow and Lane 1988a,b,c; Male et al., 1987).
       Small molecules like short peptides, although normally able to interact with the products of an immune response, often cannot cause a response on their own. These peptide immunogens or “hastens” as they are also called, are actually incomplete antigens, and, although not able by themselves to cause immunogenicity or to elicit antibody production, can be made immunogenic by coupling them to a suitable carrier. Carriers typically are protein antigens of higher molecular weight that are able to cause an immunological response when administered in vivo.
       In an immune response, antibodies are produced and secreted by the B-lymphocytes in conjunction with the T-helper (T H) cells. In the majority of hapten-carrier systems, the B cells produce antibodies that are specific for both the hapten and the carrier. In these cases, the T lymphocytes will have specific binding domains on the carrier, but will not recognize the hapten alone. In a kind of synergism, the B and T cells cooperate to induce a hapten-specific antibody response. After such an immune response has taken place, if the host is subsequently challenged with only the hapten, usually it will respond by producing hapten-specific antibodies from memory cells formed after the initial immunization.
       Synthetic haptens mimicking some critical epitopic structures on larger macromolecules are often conjugated to carriers to create an immune response to the larger “parent” molecule. For instance, short peptide segments can be synthesized from the known sequence of a protein and coupled to a carrier to induce immunogenicity toward the native protein. This type of synthetic approach to the immunogen production has become the basis of much of the current research into the creation of vaccines. However, in many instances, merely creating a B-cell response by using synthetic peptide-carrier conjugates, however well designed, will not always guarantee complete protective immunity toward an intact antigen. The immune response generated by a short peptide epitope from a larger viral particle or bacterial cell may only be sufficient to generate memory at the B cell level. In these cases it is generally now accepted that a cytotoxic T-cell response is a more important indicator of protective immunity. Designing peptide immunogens with the proper epitopic binding sites for both B-cell and T-cell recognition is one of the most challenging research areas in immunology today.
       The approach to increasing immunogenicity of small or poorly immunogenic molecules by conjugating these molecules to large “carrier” molecules has been utilized successfully for decades (see, e.g., Goebel et al. (1939) J. Exp. Med. 69: 53). For example, many immunogenic compositions have been described in which purified capsular polymers have been conjugated to carrier proteins to create more effective immunogenic compositions by exploiting this “carrier effect.” Schneerson et al. (1984) Infect. Immun. 45: 582-591). Conjugation has also been shown to bypass the poor antibody response usually observed in infants when immunized with a free polysaccharide (Anderson et al. (1985) J. Pediatr. 107: 346; Insel et al. (1986) J. Exp. Med. 158: 294).
       Hapten-carrier conjugates have been successfully generated using various cross-linking/coupling reagents such as homobifunctional, heterobifunctional, or zero-length cross linkers. Many such methods are currently available for coupling of saccharides, proteins, and peptides to peptide carriers. Most methods create amine, amide, urethane, isothiourea, or disulfide bonds, or in some cases thioethers. A disadvantage to the use of coupling reagents, which introduce reactive sites in to the side chains of reactive amino acid molecules on carrier and/or hapten molecules, is that the reactive sites if not neutralized are free to react with any unwanted molecule either in vitro (thus adversely affecting the functionality or stability of the conjugate(s)) or in vivo (thus posing a potential risk of adverse events in persons or animals immunized with the preparations). Such excess reactive sites can be reacted or “capped”, so as to inactivate these sites, utilizing various known chemical reactions, but these reactions may be otherwise disruptive to the functionality of the conjugates. This may be particularly problematic when attempting to create a conjugate by introducing the reactive sites into the carrier molecule, as its larger size and more complex structure (relative to the hapten) may render it more vulnerable to the disruptive effects of chemical treatment. In fact, no examples are known of methods whereby a conjugate is made by first activating the carrier, then reacting with the hapten in a conjugation reaction, and finally “capping” the remaining reactive sites, while preserving the ability of the resulting conjugate to function as an immunogenic composition having the desired properties of the “carrier effect”.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002670491,"BACKGROUND
      Phage display of peptides or proteins on filamentous phage particles is an in vitro technology which allows the selection of peptides or proteins with desired properties from large pools of variant peptides or proteins (McCafferty et al., Nature, 348: 552-554 (1990); Sidhu et al., Current Opinion in Biotechnology, 11: 610-616 (2000); Smith et al., Science, 228: 1315-1317 (1985)). Phage display may be used to display diverse libraries of peptides or proteins, including antibody fragments, such as Fabs in the antibody discovery field, on the surface of a filamentous phage particle which are then selected for binding to a particular antigen of interest. The antibody fragment may be displayed on the surface of the filamentous phage particle by fusing the gene for the antibody fragment to that of a phage coat protein, resulting in a phage particle that displays the encoded antibody fragment on its surface. This technology allows the isolation of antibody fragments with desired affinity to many antigens form a large phage library.
      For phage-based antibody discovery, evaluation of selected antibody fragments and the properties of their cognate IgGs in functional assays (such as target binding, cell-based activity assays, in vivo half-life, etc.) requires reformatting of the Fab heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) sequences into a full-length IgG by subcloning the DNA sequences encoding the HC and LC out of the vector used for phage display and into mammalian expression vectors for IgG expression. The laborious process of subcloning dozens or hundreds of selected HC/LC pairs represents a major bottleneck in the phage-based antibody discovery process. Furthermore, since a substantial percentage of selected Fabs, once reformatted, fail to perform satisfactorily in initial screening assays, increasing the number of clones carried through this reformatting/screening process greatly increases the ultimate probability of success.
      Here, we describe the generation of an expression and secretion system for driving expression of a Fab-phage fusion when transformed into E. coli, and of driving expression of a full-length IgG bearing the same Fab fragment when transfected into mammalian cells. We demonstrate that a mammalian signal sequence from the murine binding immunoglobulin protein (mBiP) (Haas et al., Immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, Nature, 306: 387-389 (1983); Munro et al., An Hsp70-like protein in the ER: identify with the 78 kd glucose-regulated protein and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, Cell, 4:291-300 (1986) can drive efficient protein expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Using mammalian mRNA splicing to remove a synthetic intron containing a phage fusion peptide inserted within the hinge region of the human IgG 1 HC, we are able to generate two distinct proteins in a host cell-dependent fashion: a Fab fragment fused to an adaptor peptide for phage display in E. coli and native human IgG 1 in mammalian cells. This technology allows for the selection of Fab fragments that bind to an antigen of interest from a phage display library with subsequent expression and purification of the cognate full-length IgGs in mammalian cells without the need for subcloning.

Accordingly, described herein are nucleic acid molecules for the expression and secretion of a Fab fragment fused to a phage particle protein, coat protein or adaptor protein for phage display in bacteria when the nucleic acid is transformed into prokaryotic host cells (e.g. E. coli) and a Fab fragment fused to Fc when the nucleic acid is transformed into eukaryotic cells (e.g. mammalian cells), without the need for subcloning, and methods of use.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002760997,"BACKGROUND
      Approximately 10-15 million people suffer from type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), the most common metabolic disorder in infancy and adolescence, affecting 112,000 children younger than 16 years of age in Europe alone. T1D results from a progressive immune-mediated destruction of the pancreatic insulin-producing islet beta-cells (“beta-cells”) in genetically-susceptible individuals, leading to chronic hyperglycemia which instigates micro- and macrovascular complications. See, e.g., van Belle, T. L. et al., Physiol. Rev. 2011, 91(1): 79-118. While therapeutic options are available for some autoimmune diseases, no therapies are currently approved for T1D. Patients with T1D require lifelong treatment with insulin. Moreover, long-term management requires a multidisciplinary approach that includes physicians, nurses, dieticians, and other specialists.
      Blocking autoreactive effector T cells using generalized immunosuppression, either in the context of short-term therapy or chronic regimens, has been the sole therapeutic strategy in autoimmune diseases. It is believed that activating or expanding regulatory T (Treg) cells can restore a balance between effector T cells and Treg cells, and may achieve the same objective without the toxicity associated with immunosuppression.
      Interleukin-2 (“IL-2”) has key functions of the immune system, primarily via its direct effects on T cells. In the thymus, where T cells mature, it prevents autoimmune diseases by promoting the differentiation of certain immature T cells into regulatory T cells, which suppress other T cells that are otherwise primed to attack healthy cells in the body. At higher concentrations, IL-2 also promotes the differentiation of T cells into effector T cells and into memory T cells when the initial T cell is also stimulated by an antigen, thus helping the body fight off infections.
      Native IL-2 was initially identified as a lymphocyte growth factor, and thought to primarily promote effector T cell responses in vivo, and recombinant IL-2 was developed for the treatment of conditions calling for the boosting of effector T cells, i.e. cancer and infectious diseases. However, it was shown that IL-2 is dispensable for the differentiation, survival and function of effector T cells, as IL-2 knockout mice develop T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease. IL-2 is now known to be a cytokine critical for Treg cell development, expansion, survival and peripheral activity. A deficiency in IL-2 production or lack of IL-2 responsiveness leads to a loss of Treg cell function and an increase in autoimmunity. Treg cells constitutively express the trimeric high affinity receptor for IL-2 (IL-2Rαβγ) at higher levels than CD4 + and CD8 + effector T cells, NK cells, and eosinophils. Induction of STAT5a signaling occurs at lower doses of IL-2 in Treg cells than in effector T cells. Hence, low dose IL-2 appears to stimulate preferential activation and promote the survival of Treg cells in vivo. See, e.g., Yu, A., et al., Diabetes 2015, 64: 2172-2183.
      In clinical studies, administration of IL-2 induced immunological changes, but did not change variables of glucose metabolism. See, e.g., Hartemann A. et al., Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. 2013; 1:295-305; and Rosenzwajg M. et al., J Autoimmun. 2015; 58:48-58.
      Pharmaceutical IL-2 preparations are administered by injection. Although oral delivery is attractive, e.g., as a result of the ease of administration, gastrointestinal degradation and low levels of absorption generally render this route ineffective for the delivery of polypeptides. Alternative routes such as nasal, rectal, pulmonary, and ocular routes are being investigated for polypeptide-based therapeutics.
      Genetically modified bacteria have been used to deliver therapeutic molecules to the mucosal tissues. See, e.g., Steidler, L., et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2003, 21(7): 785-789; and Robert S. and Steidler L., Microb. Cell Fact. 2014, 13 Suppl. 1: S11.
      Intestinal introduction of antigens implicated in beta-cell autoimmunity via genetically-altered Lactococcus lactis, has been shown to arrest T1D in NOD mice via induction of Foxp3+ Treg cells. Oral administration of genetically-altered Lactococcus lactis targets human pro-insulin (PINS) along with human IL-10 to the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, and in combination with systemic low-dose anti-CD3 antibody, resets the immune system towards long-term tolerance in nearly 60% of new-onset diabetic NOD mice. See, e.g., Robert, S. et al., Diabetes 2014, 63: 2876-2887; and Takiishi, T. et al., J. Clin. Inv. 2012, 122(5): 1717-1725. However, clinical translation of such antigen-specific combination therapy involving additional immuno-modulators, such as anti-CD3 antibodies, is being hampered, e.g., because Fc-modified anti-human CD3 antibodies have not been approved by regulatory agencies for the treatment of T1D.
      There is a need in the art for efficacious, targeted, and controlled methods for the treatment of T1D, without off-target activities and systemic toxicities. Such strategies should facilitate administration, increase safety, and ideally, improve efficacy and reduce therapeutically effective doses. The present disclosure addresses these needs.

BRIEF SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      Accordingly, provided are compositions and methods involving live lactic acid fermenting bacteria (LAB), e.g., genetically modified Lactococcus lactis (LL) strains, as delivery vehicles for the mucosal delivery of low-dose IL-2, e.g., in combination with T1D-specific self-antigens, such as proinsulin (PINS). The LAB are genetically modified to express the bioactive polypeptides, which induce biological responses, which in turn, block further autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Such strategy can reverse established T1D, e.g., in subjects with sufficient residual beta-cell function, and thus represent a “true” treatment for auto-immune diabetes.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002585226,"PRIOR ART
      Terrestrial bloodsucking ectoparasites such as mosquitoes, fleas and ticks are vectors for transmission of infectious agents causing diseases. Some of these diseases directly affect human and/or their affective animals, while others are causing great economic losses in the agricultural field. Examples of diseases transmitted by ectoparasites are malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue fever, ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease. Ticks are considered the second transmitter of diseases to humans after mosquitoes (P. Parola and D. Raoult, Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2001, 7: 80-83). Haemoparasitic infections transmitted by ticks cause annual losses in the order of billions of U.S. dollars in the livestock industry, primarily affecting cattle production in tropical and subtropical areas. Among the diseases most important in this regard include anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burdogferi) and the so-called East Coast fever ( Theileria parva produced).
      Ectoparasites known as sea lice ( Copepoda, Caligidae) are the most widespread marine pathogen in the last 30 years in the salmon industry, ranging over the past 15 years other species of farmed fish and wild stocks of salmonids (Pike, A W and Wadsworth, S L Advances in Parasitology 2000, 44:233-337, Ragi, V. et al. Aquaculture 2004, 242: 727-733). The economic losses are caused by organisms of the genera Caligus and Lepeophtheirus. The so-called sea lice can cause physiological changes in their hosts, including the development of a stress response, reduced immune function, osmoregulation failure and death if untreated infection (Johnson, S C, et al. Zool Studies 2004, 43: 8-19). There is also some evidence to suggest that sea lice could be vectors for transmission of infections caused by viruses and bacteria to fish (Barker, E D, et al. Parasitology Research 2009, 105: 1173-1177).
      A wide variety of chemicals and drugs have been used to control tick infestations and sea lice. The use of chemical pesticides as amidines, organophosphates, hydrogen peroxide and other currently constitutes the fundamental measure to control these ectoparasites. However, the intensive use of these chemicals has drawbacks as the contamination of food (fish, meat and milk), environmental pollution and development of resistance by ectoparasites (Y E Shahein Vet. Immunol. And Immunopathol. 2008, 121: 281-289, Denholm, I. Pest Manag Sci 2002, 58: 528-536, Bravo, S. et al. Aquaculture 2008, 282: 7-12, Lees et al. J. Fish Dis. 2008, 31: 947-951).
      Vaccination is considered a promising alternative for controlling infestations by ectoparasites from the standpoint of efficacy, environmental safety and economic sustainability. The feasibility of using antigens produced by recombinant DNA techniques for this purpose has been demonstrated with Bm86-based commercial vaccines against Rhipicephalus microplus tick (TickGARD, Hoechst Animal Health, Australia, and Gavac marketed by Heber Biotec, Cuba). The latter has proven effective in field studies where the application is included within an integrated control program. In the case of sea lice there are some advances in the use of proteins as vaccine candidates, as is the case of akirin-2 of Caligus rogercresseyi, which is called my32. Challenging trials with my32 have been performed with promising results (Patent Application WO2008/145074 “Sequences of nucleic acids and amino acids, and vaccine for the control of infestations by ectoparasites in fish”).
      Identification of novel protective antigens is the limiting step in increasing the effectiveness of these vaccines. Although emerging tick proteins have been identified recently, and have been proposed as potential protective molecules, only a limited number of them have been evaluated in vaccine trials as antigens produced by recombinant DNA techniques. In the case of sea lice which are ectoparasites that feed on mucus, skin and blood of the host and therefore have only limited contact with the host immune system (Boxaspen, K. ICES Journal of Marine Science 2006, 63: 1304-1316) have been investigated as vaccine candidates, the parasite immunomodulatory proteins that suppress the host immune response in the adhesion and feeding sites (Wikel, S K et al. “Arthropod modulation of host immune responses”. In: The Immunology of Host-Ectoparasiticide Arthropod Relationships. Editors: Wikel, S K, CAB Int, 1996, pp. 107-130). Have also studied other vitellogenin-like molecules and adhesion proteins to the host (Johnson, S C et al. Zool Studies 2004, 43: 8-19; Boxaspen, K. ICES Journal of Marine Science 2006, 63: 1304-1316) but due to poor knowledge of the mechanisms and pathology of the salmon infestation by sea lice, targets identification for prevention and treatment of this infection have not been successful. However, the research results in the evaluation of different vaccine candidates in immunization trials have shown that the combined use of several molecules involved in different physiological processes, is a feasible method to control ectoparasite infestations.
      Eukaryotic ribosomes are composed of individual molecules of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and more than 80 proteins organized into major and minor subunits. Most ribosomal proteins are basic (isoelectric point (pI)>8.5), but there is also a group of acidic proteins (pI=3.0 to 5.0) whichs form a stalk-like structure in the largest ribosome subunit. These acidic proteins are called P proteins (P0, P1 and P2), due to its ability to be phosphorylated, which plays a fundamental role in regulating translational activity of ribosomes (Wojda I. et al. Acta biochar. Pol. 2002, 49: 947-957). P proteins contain a conserved C-terminal region of about 17 amino acids, whose last six residues are highly conserved, which forms the basis of immunological cross-reactivity between them and the P proteins of other species. The P0 protein is essential for the assembly of 60S ribosomal subunit. P0 binds directly to P1, P2, 28S rRNA and the factor eEF2. Its absence leads to the generation of deficient ribosomes of the 60S subunit, which are inactive for protein synthesis, leading to cell death.
      The P proteins are highly immunogenic and have been extensively studied in humans because of its association with autoimmune diseases and carcinogenesis. These applications of ribosomal proteins have been protected by patents by their respective authors. The ribosomal protein P0, in particular, is a promising vaccine candidate against several protozoa and bacteria. It was immunogenic as recombinant antigen (either using the whole protein or C-terminal region consisting of the last 11-16 amino acids) or by naked DNA immunization against Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum (H. Zhang et al. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol 2007, 153: 141-148), Trypanosoma cruzi (Skeiky Y A et al. J. Immunol. 1993, 151: 5504-5515), Leishmania infantum (S. Iborra et al., Infect. Immunol. 2003, 71: 6562-6572 and 2005, 72: 5515-5521) and several species of Babesia (Terkawi M A et al., Vaccine 2007, 25: 2027-2035; Terkawi M A et al. Parasitol. Res 2007, 102: 35-40) and Plasmodium (S. Chatterjee et al. Infect. Immunol. 2000, 68: 4312-4318; Rajeshwari K. et al. Infect. Immunol. 2004, 72: 5515-5521). The immune response obtained in most of these experiments was characterized by the generation of high titers of specific antibodies, capable of conferring active and passive protection against infection, activation of T lymphocytes and the gamma interferon production (IFNγ) as part of a Th1 response pattern.
      Its use as an immunogen against various bacteria and protozoa, without the report of autoimmune reactions in the host was due to the relatively low amino acid sequence identity of this protein between these microorganisms and mammals. The most striking case was the immunization of mice with a peptide consisting of the last 16 amino acids of P0ribosomal protein of Plasmodium falciparum (Rajeshwari K. et al., Infect. Immunol. 2004, 72: 5515-5521), which presents 68% identity with the C-terminus of this same protein in mice. However, the use of this whole protein or its C-terminal region as immunogens to control ticks and sea lice infestations is limited by the high degree of amino acid identity that exists for this antigen among ectoparasites and their host organisms.
      Recent experiments with specific interference RNA silencing expression of this protein in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks showed a significant decrease in weight gain of ticks, and a mortality of 96%, caused by structural level affectations of salivary gland and cuticle, suggesting that P0 ribosomal protein is necessary for the ingestion of blood and viability of ticks and possibly of other ectoparasites (Gong H et al. Vet. Parasitol. 2008, 151: 268-278). However, the development of a vaccine candidate based on this antigen has as drawbacks the high degree of identity between the reported sequences of host vertebrates and his ectoparasites such as ticks and sea lice, which is higher in the C-terminus of the protein. This can result in the induction of tolerance or the generation of autoantibodies in the host organism.
      The intensive use of chemicals and drugs to control infestations of ticks and sea lice has drawbacks as the contamination of food with chemical residues, environmental pollution and the development of resistance by ectoparasites. Therefore, vaccination is considered a promising alternative and there is a need to identify new vaccine antigens that are capable of conferring protection by itself or can be incorporated into existing vaccines.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention solves the above problem by providing a vaccine composition for the control of infestations by ectoparasites comprising a peptide of the P0 ribosomal protein of these ectoparasites. This composition comprises as antigen, an immunogenic region of the P0 ribosomal protein that is little conserved among ectoparasites and the organisms affected by them, according to results of a study to be disclosed in this invention, the first time. The region identified in the P0 ribosomal protein is between 267 and 301 amino acids of the same.
      The presence of P0 protein in all organisms as a structural component of ribosomes and essential for cell viability is an advantage for the use of these sequences with the objective to obtain vaccine candidates against different species of ectoparasites. However, the use of this protein or its C-terminal region as immunogen to control infestations of ticks and sea lice is limited by the high degree of amino acid identity that exists for this antigen among ectoparasites and their host organisms.
      This situation is avoided for the first time in this invention, by identifying highly immunogenic regions within the protein, which coincide with areas of low sequence similarity between these groups of organisms. By bioinformatics' predictions, it was found that this region coincides with an area of low hydrophobicity and high degree of accessibility of protein, which makes likely this amino acid sequence to be exposed.
      Complementary DNAs (cDNA) were generated by reverse-transcription starting from total RNA of Rhipicephalus microplus and R. sanguineus larvae and adult sea lice from Caligus rogercresseyi specie. The nucleotide sequences encoding P0 ribosomal protein of these ticks (SEQ ID NO. 1 and SEQ NO. 2) and that sea lice were amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using these cDNAs and specific oligonucleotides.
      The polypeptide sequences for P0 protein of ectoparasites R. microplus and R. sanguineus were identical between them, and were designated as SEQ ID NO. 3. This sequence and that of the C. rogercresseyi's P0 showed a sequence identity greater than 70% with the P0 proteins of its host organisms, while still higher for the last 16 amino acids of the C-terminal, described as the most immunogenic within the protein. The lesser similarity area in amino acid sequence, which in turn is likely to be exposed and be immunogenic, was detected in all cases in the region between amino acids 267 and 301 (SEQ ID NO.4, peptide corresponding P0 protein of Rhipicephalus microplus [pP0] SEQ ID NO.6, peptide corresponding P0 protein of Ixodes scapularis [pP0Is] SEQ ID NO.8, peptide corresponding P0 protein of Caligus clemensi [pP0Cc], SEQ ID No.9, peptide corresponding P0 protein of L. salmonis [pP0Ls] and SEQ ID NO.10, peptide corresponding P0 protein of C. rogercresseyi [pP0Cr]).
      Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, the vaccine composition comprises a peptide with an amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO. 4, SEQ ID NO. 6, SEQ ID NO. 8, SEQ ID NO. 9 or SEQ ID NO. 10, a fragment of those sequences, or a peptide or polypeptide that exhibits at least 70% identity with such sequences. The present invention relates also to those vaccine compositions where the indicated P0 peptide is fused, is combined or co-administered with another molecule, to increase their immunogenicity or enhance their protective effect. Such molecules are carrier proteins and immune-carriers. In one embodiment of the invention, this molecule is selected from the group consisting of hemocyanin, T-cell epitopes, the proteins that form virus-like particles, Bm86 protein from the R. microplus tick, the Rs86 protein from the R. sanguineus tick and my32 protein of C. rogercresseyi or L. salmonis. sea lice.
      The peptides identified as SEQ ID NO. 4, 6, 9 and 10, between 35 and 36 amino acids, and 20 amino acids fragments of these were obtained by chemical synthesis and conjugated to hemocyanin (Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin English, abbreviated as KLH) of Megathura crenulata, to enhance immunogenicity. Immunization experiments with challenge under controlled conditions were conducted with these conjugates to assess their protective capabilities. P0 peptide (pP0-SEQ ID NO. 4) was tested against R. sanguineus and R. microplus in rabbits and cattle, respectively. pP0Is (SEQ ID NO. 6) was evaluated against I. scapularis in rabbits. For its part, the peptides pP0Ls and pP0Cr (SEQ ID NO. 9 and SEQ ID NO.10, respectively) were evaluated against L. salmonis and C. rogercresseyi, respectively, both in Salmo salar.
      Immunization of rabbits and cattle with the vaccine formulation containing the protein conjugate (pP0-KLH) and adjuvant Montanide 888 was able to induce a strong specific humoral immune response against the peptide in both cases. There was no evidence of the occurrence of an autoimmune specific response in experimental animals used, which was triggered by the recognition and reactivity of the P0 protein of these mammals by the antibodies generated against the pP0 peptide. This was confirmed by an “in vitro” cross-reactivity test in the RK-13 cell line of rabbit kidney, using hyperimmune serum against the peptide obtained in mice. Vaccinations with pP0-KLH conjugate induced protection against infestations by R. sanguineus and R. microplus, causing structural damages and affected biological parameters in both species of ticks. In addition, similar results were obtained against I. scapularis ticks after immunization with the synthetic peptide of the P0 protein of this tick (pP0Is) conjugated to hemocyanin.
      The vaccination of salmon with pP0Ls-KLH and pP0Cr-KLH conjugates induced protection against infestations by both species of sea lice, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the number of parasites per fish. Immunization experiments were also conducted with pP0 and pP0Cr obtained by recombinant techniques, fused to the T epitopes of tetanus toxin and the fusion protein of measles virus (Measles Virus Fusion English protein, abbreviated MVF) in the same gene construct. As a result of immunization experiments with these chimeric antigens, in the case of sea lice, we found that fusion to the promiscuous T epitopes significantly improves the protection in comparison with antigen conjugated to KLH.
      The pP0 was also fused to virus-like particles (VLPs) of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV), and found further that when the P0 peptide is fused to Bm86 antigen, the protective effect of the peptide is enhanced. This could be due to the combined effect of the antibodies produced against both immunogens and/or the fact that the structural damage caused by antibodies directed against the Bm86 antigen, at the gut of ticks, facilitates the action of specific antibodies against the peptide of P0 ribosomal protein. On the other hand, pP0Cr was fused to the my32 protein in another gene construct, and in this case, the most relevant effects on damages to C. rogercresseyi were obtained, presumably by enhancing of the individual specific effect of the two antigens.
      Thus, in the invention was demonstrated that the vaccine compositions based on the pP0 peptide are effective for controlling infestations by ectoparasites such as ticks and sea lice. Therefore, pP0 based compositions are also useful for controlling the transmission of pathogens associated with these ectoparasites.
      This vaccine comprises immunologically effective amount of antigen in a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, by which to control infestations by these pathogens. As stated, the antigen in this vaccine is a peptide of the P0 ribosomal protein of these ectoparasites, between 267 and 301 amino acids, which corresponds to the region of least similarity in the amino acid sequence of the ectoparasite protein with the same region of the protein in their respective host organisms. This peptide is obtained by recombinant techniques or by chemical synthesis. Fused polypeptides comprising the P0 peptide can also be obtained by recombinant techniques. As known to those versed in this field of technology, the production of such antigens by recombinant means can use an expression system in yeast, bacteria, plants, insect larvae, insect cells or mammalian cells.
      In one embodiment of the invention, the vaccine compositions may further comprise a vaccine adjuvant. In the context of the invention, vaccine formulations were evaluated comprising an oily adjuvant type. However, as adjuvants can be used aluminum salts, liposomal vesicles, immune system related molecules such as cytokines, among others.
      The compositions of the invention can be administered in many different ways. In one embodiment of the invention, the composition is administered by injection. In another embodiment, formulations are administered through feed. In the event that the compositions are administered to fish can be applied using immersion baths.
      Another object of the present invention is a vaccine composition for controlling infestations by ectoparasites comprising nucleic acids encoding the peptide of P0 ribosomal protein of these ectoparasites, corresponding to the region between 267 and 301 amino acids of the protein, and generates an immune response against the peptide by immunization with naked DNA. In one embodiment of the invention, this peptide has an amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO. 4, SEQ ID NO. 6, SEQ ID NO. 8, SEQ ID NO. 9 or SEQ ID NO. 10, or it is a fragment of those sequences, or a peptide or polypeptide that exhibits at least 70% identity with such sequences.
      The invention also relates to the use of the region between 267 and 301 amino acids of P0 ribosomal protein of ectoparasites in the manufacture of a vaccine composition to control infestations by these parasites or pathogens associated to them. In one embodiment, said peptide has an amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO. 4, SEQ ID NO. 6, SEQ ID NO. 8, SEQ ID NO. 9 or SEQ ID NO. 10, or it is a fragment of those sequences, or a peptide or polypeptide that exhibits at least 70% identity with such sequences.
Advantages of the Proposed Solution
      The present invention demonstrates the protective capacity of a vaccine formulation, which contains a peptide between amino acids 267 and 301 of the P0 ribosomal protein of different ectoparasites, against ticks as R. microplus, R. sanguineus and I. scapularis, and ectoparasites known as L. salmonis and C. rogercresseyi sea lice, without the occurrence of cross-react with the same protein in the host organisms. In all immunizations, the pP0 was administered conjugated or fused to an immune-carrier molecule to enhance the immune response of animals. In the case of ticks, the application of this peptide (or fragments thereof) fused to the Bm86 protein or combined with it, induces a greater damage on the viability and biological parameters of these arthropods than the damages caused by antigens when used individually. Therefore, the application of this chimera protein or combination of them as part of an integrated control program, could result in greater control of infestations by these or other tick species as well as in reducing the incidence of tick borne haemoparasitic diseases. In the case of sea lice, the greatest damages was observed when the pP0Cr was fused to promiscuous T epitopes and my32 protein. The high conservation degree of the peptide amino acid sequence among most arthropod species and sea lice, and low identity of this sequence with the corresponding fragment of the protein in mammals and fish, makes this peptide of P0 ribosomal protein (or fragments thereof) an antigen for the development of vaccines against ectoparasites.
BRIEF FIGURE DESCRIPTIONS"
0002529950,"BACKGROUND
      In the course of evolution, many organisms tackled the task of introducing macromolecules into living cells. Aside from the cell-specific, usually receptor-mediated or active uptake mechanisms, the general solution that has independently emerged in many lineages relies on peptides specifically evolved to interact with, and insert into lipid bilayer membranes. Thus, bacterial colicins, human porins, and protein transduction domains (PTDs) from diverse species share the motif of a positively charged alpha-helix, frequently with an amphipathic structure, which is capable of inserting into lipid membranes, and delivering larger cargoes intracellularly. Recent research reports confirm the successful use of PTDs fused to proteins for their delivery across biological boundaries, including the blood-brain barrier, and the placenta.
      Mitochondria are the α-proteobacterial, energy producing and cell death controlling endosymbionts in all eukaryotic cells (Fitzpatrick, et al., Mol Biol Evol., 23(1):74-85 (2006)). The mitochondrial outer membrane has a lipid composition similar to that of eukaryotic plasma membranes, whereas the mitochondrial inner membrane contains a unique lipid, cardiolipin, and more closely resembles bacterial membranes. Mitochondria contain their own DNA, transcription and translation machinery, involved in producing proteins necessary to carry out oxidative phosphorylation. Many diseases are associated with a decline in mitochondrial number, mitochondrial function, or more specifically, oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, increasing mitochondrial function, number and/or oxidative phosphorylation in a basal or healthy state may increase the capabilities of cells and tissues heavily reliant on mitochondrial metabolism, such as brain and muscle.
      Therefore it is an object of the invention to provide compositions and methods for increasing mitochondrial number, mitochondrial function and/or oxidative phosphorylation in a subject.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002766890,"BACKGROUND
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common kidney cancer and constitutes about 3% of all malignant tumors in adults. Until 2005, interferon-alpha (IFN-α) and high-dose interleukin (IL)-2 therapies were the standards of care for patients with advanced RCC (aRCC), albeit with modest efficacy. Since then, development and approval of multiple vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have significantly improved the outcomes of aRCC patients. These agents include the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib and sorafenib, the mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus, and the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. However, despite the substantial improvement of patient outcomes with these agents, durable and complete responses in aRCC patients are uncommon; the majority of patients will eventually develop resistance, exhibit disease progression while on therapy, and succumb to death due to metastatic disease.
      The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and PD-1 ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2, respectively) play integral roles in immune regulation. Expressed on activated T cells, PD-1 is activated by PD-L1 (also known as B7-H1) and PD-L2 expressed by stromal cells, tumor cells, or both, initiating T-cell death and localized immune suppression (Dong et al., Nat Med 1999; 5:1365-69; Freeman et al. J Exp Med 2000; 192:1027-34), potentially providing an immune-tolerant environment for tumor development and growth. Conversely, inhibition of this interaction can enhance local T-cell responses and mediate antitumor activity in nonclinical animal models (Iwai Y, et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2002; 99:12293-97). Avelumab is a fully human mAb of the IgG1 isotype that specifically targets and blocks PD-L1. Avelumab is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MSB0010718C.
      Axitinib is a VEGF receptor (VEGFR) TKI. The antitumor activity of single-agent axitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID) in previously untreated patients with clear cell aRCC was assessed against sorafenib in a randomized, open-label, Phase 3 trial. Although the study did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS) between patients treated with axitinib or sorafenib, axitinib was associated with a longer median PFS (mPFS) time (mPFS of 10.1 months (95% CI 7.2,12.1) with axitinib vs. 6.5 months (95% CI 4.7, 8.3) with sorafenib, stratified hazard ratio 0.77 (95% CI 0.56, 1.05)).
      4-1BB (CD137 and TNFRSF9), which was first identified as an inducible costimulatory receptor expressed on activated T cells, is a membrane spanning glycoprotein of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. Current understanding of 4-1BB indicates that expression is generally activation dependent and encompasses a broad subset of immune cells including activated NK and NKT cells; regulatory T cells; dendritic cells (DC) including follicular DC; stimulated mast cells, differentiating myeloid cells, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and activated B cells. 4-1BB expression has also been demonstrated on tumor vasculature (19-20) and atherosclerotic endothelium. The ligand that stimulates 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is expressed on activated antigen presenting cells (APCs), myeloid progenitor cells and hematopoietic stem cells. 4-1BB agonist mAbs increase costimulatory molecule expression and markedly enhance cytolytic T lymphocyte responses, resulting in anti-tumor efficacy in various models. 4-1BB agonist mAbs have demonstrated efficacy in prophylactic and therapeutic settings and both monotherapy and combination therapy tumor models and have established durable anti-tumor protective T cell memory responses.
      Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a member of the family of proteins referred to as colony stimulating factors (CSFs). M-CSF, also known as CSF-1, is a secreted or a cell surface glycoprotein comprised of two subunits that are joined by a disulfide bond with a total molecular mass varying from 40 to 90 kD (Stanley E. R., et al., Mol. Reprod. Dev., 46:4-10 (1997)). Similar to other CSFs, M-CSF is produced by macrophages, monocytes, and human joint tissue cells, such as chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts, in response to proteins such as interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. M-CSF stimulates the formation of macrophage colonies from pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (Stanley E. R., et al., Mol. Reprod. Dev., 46:4-10 (1997)). M-CSF typically binds to its receptor, c-fms, in order to exert a biological effect. c-fms contains five extracellular Ig domains, one transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain with two kinase domains. Upon M-CSF binding to c-fms, the receptor homo-dimerizes and initiates a cascade of signal transduction pathways including the JAK/STAT, PI3K, and ERK pathways.
      The OX40 receptor (OX40, also known as CD134, TNFRSF4, ACT-4, ACT35, and TXGP1L) is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. OX40 is found to be expressed on activated CD4+ T-cells. High numbers of OX40+ T cells have been demonstrated within tumors (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) and in the draining lymph nodes of cancer patients (Weinberg, A. et al., J. Immunol. 164: 2160-69, 2000; Petty, J. et al., Am. J. Surg. 183: 512-518, 2002). It was shown in tumor models in mice that engagement of OX40 in vivo during tumor priming significantly delayed and prevented the appearance of tumors as compared to control treated mice (Weinberg et al., 2000). Therefore, it has been contemplated to enhance the immune response of a mammal to an antigen by engaging OX40 through the use of an OX40 binding agent (WO 99/42585; Weinberg et al., 2000).
      The rituximab antibody is a genetically engineered chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen. Rituximab is the antibody called “C2B8” in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,137 issued Apr. 7, 1998 (Anderson et al.). Rituximab is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular, CD20 positive, B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In vitro mechanism of action studies have demonstrated that rituximab binds human complement and lyses lymphoid B cell lines through complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) (Reff et al. Blood 83(2):435-445 (1994)). Additionally, it has significant activity in assays for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
      There is a need for improved therapies for the treatment of cancers. Furthermore, there is a need for therapies having greater efficacy than existing therapies. Preferred combination therapies of the present invention show greater efficacy than treatment with either therapeutic agent alone.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002681730,"BACKGROUND
      KIT (or c-Kit) is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-kit gene. KIT comprises five extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a single transmembrane region, an inhibitory cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain, and a split cytoplasmic kinase domain separated by a kinase insert segment (see, e.g., Yarden et al., Nature, 1986, 323:226-232; Ullrich and Schlessinger, Cell, 1990, 61:203-212; Clifford et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278:31461-31464). The human c-kit gene encoding the KIT receptor has been cloned as described by Yarden et al., EMBO J., 1987, 6:3341-3351. KIT is also known as CD117 or stem cell factor receptor (“SCFR”), because it is the receptor for the stem cell factor (“SCF”) ligand (also known as Steel Factor or Kit Ligand). SCF ligand binding to the first three extracellular Ig-like domains of KIT induces receptor dimerization, and thereby activates intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity through the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane and kinase domains (see, e.g., Weiss and Schlessinger, Cell, 1998, 94:277-280; Clifford et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278:31461-31464). Members of the Stat, Src, ERK, and AKT signaling pathways have been shown to be downstream signal transducers of KIT signaling.
      The fourth (D4) and fifth (D5) extracellular Ig-like domains of KIT are believed to mediate receptor dimerization (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2008/153926; Yuzawa et al., Cell, 2007, 130:323-334).
      Expression of KIT has been detected in various cell types, such as mast cells, stem cells, brain cells, melanoblasts, ovary cells, and cancer cells (e.g., leukemia cells). Studies of loss-of-function KIT mutations indicate that KIT is important for the normal growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells, mast cells, melanocytes, primordial germ cells, and the interstitial cells of Cajal (see, e.g., Besmer, P., Curr. Opin. Cell Biol., 1991, 3:939-946; Lyman et al., Blood, 1998, 91:1101-1134; Ashman, L. K., Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol., 1999, 31:1037-1051; Kitamura et al., Mutat. Res., 2001, 477:165-171; Mol et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278:31461-31464). Moreover, KIT plays an important role in hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis (see Ueda et al., Blood, 2002, 99:3342-3349).
      Abnormal KIT activity has been implicated in connection with a number of cancers. For example, gain-of-function KIT mutations resulting in SCF-independent, constitutive activation of KIT are found in certain cancer cells and are associated with certain cancers such as leukemia (e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (see, e.g., Mol et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278:31461-31464).

4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002650788,"BACKGROUND
      The selective destruction of an individual cell or a specific cell type is often desirable in a variety of clinical settings. For example, it is a primary goal of cancer therapy to specifically destroy tumor cells, while leaving healthy cells and tissues intact and undamaged.
      An attractive way of achieving this is by inducing an immune response against the tumor, to make immune effector cells such as natural killer (NK) cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) attack and destroy tumor cells. Effector cells can be activated by various stimuli, including a number of cytokines that induce signaling events through binding to their receptors on the surface of immune cells. For example interleukin-2 (IL-2), which, inter alia, stimulates proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. However, rapid blood clearance and lack of tumor specificity require systemic administration of high doses of a cytokine in order to achieve a sufficiently high concentration of the cytokine at the tumor site to activate an immune response or have an anti-tumor effect. These high systemic levels of cytokine can lead to severe toxicity and adverse reactions, as is the case also for IL-2. For use in cancer therapy, it is therefore desirable to specifically deliver cytokines to the tumor or tumor microenvironment. This can be achieved by conjugating the cytokine to a targeting moiety, e.g. an antibody or an antibody fragment, specific for a tumor antigen. A further advantage of such immunoconjugates is their increased serum half-life compared to the unconjugated cytokine. Their ability to maximize immunostimulatory activities at the site of a tumor whilst keeping systemic side effects to a minimum at a lower dose makes cytokine immunoconjugates optimal immunotherapeutic agents.
      Another way of activating effector cells is through the engagement of activating Fc receptors on their surface by the Fc portion of immunoglobulins or recombinant fusion proteins comprising an Fc region. The so-called effector functions of an antibody which are mediated by its Fc region are an important mechanism of action in antibody-based cancer immunotherapy. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, the destruction of antibody-coated target cells (e.g. tumor cells) by NK cells, is triggered when antibody bound to the surface of a cell interacts with Fc receptors on the NK cell. NK cells express FcγRIIIa (CD16a) which recognizes immunoglobulins of the IgG 1 or IgG 3 subclass. Further effector functions include antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and vary with the class and subclass of the antibody since different immune cell types bear different sets of Fc receptors which recognize different types and subtypes of immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domains (e.g. α, δ, γ, ε, or μ heavy chain constant domains, corresponding to IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, or IgM class antibodies, respectively). Various strategies have been employed to increase the effector functions of antibodies. For example, Shields et al. (J Biol Chem 9(2), 6591-6604 (2001)) show that amino acid substitutions at positions 298, 333, and/or 334 of the Fc region (EU numbering of residues) improve the binding of antibodies to FcγIIIa receptor and ADCC. Further antibody variants having amino acid modifications in the Fc region and exhibiting improved Fc receptor binding and effector function are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,737,056, WO 2004/063351 and WO 2004/099249. Alternatively, increased Fc receptor binding and effector function can be obtained by altering the glycosylation of an antibody. IgG1 type antibodies, the most commonly used antibodies in cancer immunotherapy, have a conserved N-linked glycosylation site at Asn 297 in each CH2 domain of the Fc region. The two complex biantennary oligosaccharides attached to Asn 297 are buried between the CH2 domains, forming extensive contacts with the polypeptide backbone, and their presence is essential for the antibody to mediate effector functions including antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Lifely et al., Glycobiology 5, 813-822 (1995); Jefferis et al., Immunol Rev 163, 59-76 (1998); Wright and Morrison, Trends Biotechnol 15, 26-32 (1997)). Protein engineering studies have shown that FcγRs interact with the lower hinge region of the IgG CH2 domain (Lund et al., J Immunol 157, 4963-69 (1996)). However, FcγR binding also requires the presence of the oligosaccharides in the CH2 region (Lund et al., J Immunol 157, 4963-69 (1996); Wright and Morrison, Trends Biotech 15, 26-31 (1997)), suggesting that either oligosaccharide and polypeptide both directly contribute to the interaction site or that the oligosaccharide is required to maintain an active CH2 polypeptide conformation. Modification of the oligosaccharide structure can therefore be explored as a means to increase the affinity of the interaction between IgG 1 and FcγR, and to increase ADCC activity of IgG 1 antibodies. Umaña et al. (Nat Biotechnol 17, 176-180 (1999) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684 (WO 99/54342), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety) showed that overexpression of β(1,4)-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII), a glycosyltransferase catalyzing the formation of bisected oligosaccharides, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells significantly increases the in vitro ADCC activity of antibodies produced in those cells. Overexpression of GnTIII in production cell lines leads to antibodies enriched in bisected oligosaccharides, which are generally also non-fucosylated and of the hybrid type. If in addition to GnTIII, mannosidase II (ManII) is overexpressed in production cell lines, antibodies enriched in bisected, non-fucosylated oligosaccharides of the complex type are obtained (Ferrara et al., Biotechn Bioeng 93, 851-861 (2006)). Both types of antibodies show strongly increased ADCC, as compared to antibodies with unmodified glycans, but only antibodies in which the majority of the N-glycans are of the complex type are able to induce significant complement-dependent cytotoxicity (Ferrara et al., Biotechn Bioeng 93, 851-861 (2006)). The critical factor for the increase of ADCC activity appears to be the elimination of fucose from the innermost N-acetylglucosamine residue of the oligosaccharide core, which improves binding of the IgG Fc domain to FcγRIIIa (Shinkawa et al., J Biol Chem 278, 3466-3473 (2003)). Further methods for producing antibodies with reduced fucosylation include, e.g. expression in α(1,6)-fucosyltransferase deficient host cells (Yamane-Ohnuki et al., Biotech Bioeng 87, 614-622 (2004); Niwa et al., J Immunol Methods 306, 151-160 (2006)).
      Despite the successes achieved in anti-cancer immunotherapy by the use of free cytokines, immunoconjugates or engineered antibodies, there is a continuous need for novel efficacious and safe treatment options in cancer therapy.

","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present inventors have found that the combination of these two strategies for local immune cell activation, i.e. simultaneous stimulation of effector cells by cytokine immunoconjugates and by antibodies engineered to have increased effector functions, greatly improves the efficacy of anti-cancer immunotherapy.
      Accordingly, the present invention provides a combination of (a) an immunoconjugate comprising a first antibody engineered to have reduced effector function and an effector moiety, and (b) a second antibody engineered to have increased effector function, for use in treating a disease in an individual in need thereof. In one embodiment the effector moiety is a cytokine. In one embodiment the cytokine is selected from the group consisting of IL-2, GM-CSF, IFN-α, and IL-12. In a particular embodiment the effector moiety is IL-2. In another embodiment the effector moiety is IL-12. In another particular embodiment the IL-2 effector moiety is a mutant IL-2 effector moiety comprising at least one amino acid mutation, particularly an amino acid substitution, that reduces or abolishes the affinity of the mutant IL-2 effector moiety to the α-subunit of the IL-2 receptor but preserves the affinity of the mutant IL-2 effector moiety to the intermediate-affinity IL-2 receptor, compared to the non-mutated IL-2 effector moiety. In a specific embodiment, the mutant IL-2 effector moiety comprises one, two or three amino acid substitutions at one, two or three position(s) selected from the positions corresponding to residue 42, 45, and 72 of human IL-2 (SEQ ID NO: 1).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002759846,"BACKGROUND
      Antibodies of defined specificity are being employed in an increasing number of diverse therapeutic applications. A number of methods have been used to obtain useful antibodies for human therapeutic use. These include chimeric and humanized antibodies, and fully human antibodies selected from libraries, e.g., phage display libraries, or from transgenic animals. Immunoglobulin libraries constructed in bacteriophage can derive from antibody producing cells of naïve or specifically immunized individuals and could, in principle, include new and diverse pairings of human immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. Although this strategy does not suffer from an intrinsic repertoire limitation, it requires that complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the expressed immunoglobulin fragment be synthesized and fold properly in bacterial cells. Many antigen binding regions, however, are difficult to assemble correctly as a fusion protein in bacterial cells. In addition, the protein will not undergo normal eukaryotic post-translational modifications. As a result, this method imposes a different selective filter on the antibody specificities that can be obtained. Alternatively, fully human antibodies can be isolated from libraries in eukaryotic systems, e.g., yeast display, retroviral display, or expression in DNA viruses such as poxviruses. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,858,559, and U.S. Patent Appl. Publication No. 2013-028892, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
      Many important targets for therapeutic antibodies are integral membrane proteins (IMPs), e.g., multi-pass membrane proteins (GPCRs, Ion Channels, etc.) that are difficult to express and purify in a conformationally-intact state. The absence of properly folded target proteins in an isolated state makes the identification and selection of antibodies to these targets challenging. While certain IMPs can be expressed on the surface of cells, e.g., mammalian cells, whole cells are problematic for use in antibody discovery because they are complex antigen mixtures, target expression can be low, and because certain display packages used to construct antibody libraries (e.g., vaccinia virus antibody libraries) can bind to whole cells non-specifically. There remains a need for new methods to express and display target IMPs of interest in their native conformation at a sufficient concentration and with minimal competition from other cell proteins to allow for identification and selection of therapeutic antibodies and antibody-like molecules from display libraries.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      This disclosure provides compositions and methods for expressing and displaying isolated integral membrane proteins (IMPs) or fragments thereof in a native conformation for use in the screening, selecting, and identifying of antibodies or antibody-like molecules that bind to a target IMP of interest.
      In certain embodiments, the disclosure provides an isolated polynucleotide that includes: a first nucleic acid fragment that encodes an integral membrane protein (IMP) or fragment thereof, where the IMP or fragment thereof includes at least one extra-membrane region, at least one transmembrane domain and at least one intra-membrane region, and where a portion of the first nucleic acid fragment encoding at least one intra-membrane region is situated at the 5′ or 3′ end of the first nucleic acid fragment; and a second nucleic acid fragment that encodes a vaccinia virus F13L protein or functional fragment thereof, where the second nucleic acid fragment is fused in frame to a portion of the first nucleic acid fragment that encodes an intra-membrane region of the IMP.

In certain aspects the IMP or fragment thereof displays on the surface of the EEV in a native conformation. In certain aspects the EEV-specific protein can be the vaccinia virus A33R protein, A34R protein, A56R protein, B5R protein, A36R protein, F13L protein, any membrane-associated fragment thereof, or any combination thereof.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002764740,"BACKGROUND
      Rabies is an acute infectious disease caused by rabies virus, and affects both humans and animals. Rabies virus is transmitted mainly among dogs, wolves, and cats, but other mammals such as raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes are also common hosts. Animals transmit the virus by biting each other, and humans are frequently infected by bites of diseased animals. Currently, there is no effective treatment for rabies. The mortality of rabies patients is nearly 100%. Patients generally die from respiratory or circulatory failure within 3-6 days. It is estimated that more than 70,000 people worldwide die each year from the disease and millions need post-exposure treatment.
      Rabies virus is a bullet-shaped, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus, and belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family, and the lyssavirus genus. The genome of rabies virus encodes five viral proteins, i.e. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L), nucleoprotein (N), phosphorylated protein (P), matrix protein (M) located inside the envelope of the viral protein, and outer surface glycoprotein (G). The glycoprotein (G protein) of rabies virus binds to acetylcholine, which determines the neurophagocytosis of rabies virus. The G protein (62-67 kDa) is a type I glycoprotein consisting of 505 amino acids, forms a protuberance covering the outer surface of the viral particle envelope, and has been shown to induce viral neutralizing antibodies. The G protein has at least five neutralizing epitopes. Epitope II is a discontinuous spatial epitope including amino acid residues 34-42 and amino acid residues 198-200. Epitope III is located at positions 330-338 and is a linear epitope. About 97% of the reported antibodies recognize epitope II and epitope III. Rabies virus neutralizing antibody CR4098 binds to epitope III. Few antibodies recognize epitope I and epitope IV. Rabies virus neutralizing antibody CR57 recognizes linear epitope I, i.e., position 218-240, in which the core binding domain is KLCGVL at position 226-231. Epitope IV contains residues 251 and 264. Yet another epitope is microepitope a that does not overlap with epitope III and separate from epitope III by three amino acid residues, and has only two amino acid residues 342-343.
      For prevention and treatment of rabies virus, WHO recommends that, for class III exposure and exposure above class II with wildlife bites, the subjects should receive both active and passive immunotherapies for rapid protection. Currently, the development of rabies virus vaccines for active treatment is relatively mature, and multiple rabies virus vaccines are marketed domestically and abroad for active prevention of rabies virus. While the drugs used for passive treatment after rabies virus exposure are mainly human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and equine rabies immune globulin (ERIG). Since ERIG is a heterologous protein to humans, it sometimes comes up with serious side effects. HRIG is expensive, has limited supply and has risk of potential contamination by blood-borne pathogens. There is a clinical need to develop novel passive therapeutic drugs for rabies virus infection.
      In 1989, Schumacherl et al. prepared a number of murine monoclonal antibodies against the glycoprotein and nucleoprotein of rabies virus. The protective experiments against mice and hamsters using such a monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy showed that the method not only had the ability to completely resist the attack of the lethal dose of rabies virus after passive immunization, but also had the post-exposure protective effect. In 1990, Bernhard Dietzschold et al. prepared a number of human anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies using cell fusion techniques in which Mab57 showed high affinity to the glycoprotein of rabies virus, widely neutralized rabies virus and provided protection to against mice from rabies virus attack. After obtaining the gene of anti-rabies virus antibodies, it becomes possible to prepare a human anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies using a bioreactor. In 2005, Goudsmit et al. and Bakker's research group reported two human monoclonal antibodies CR57 and CR4098 against the G protein of rabies virus. These two monoclonal antibodies were directly mixed in use and compared with HRIG. The result showed that the monoclonal antibody mixture was comparable to HRIG in post-exposure prophylaxis and had good cross-reactivity with multiple rabies virus strains, demonstrating the practical availability of recombinant human anti-rabies virus monoclonal antibodies, or even replacement of RIG. Currently, drug CL184 based on the two monoclonal antibodies has been in clinical research and has not found any side effects at the time of clinical trials. The drug is safe and effective, and may clinically replace RIG for post-exposure prophylaxis. However, CL184, which is being studied clinically, is a mixed preparation based on two monoclonal antibodies and requires relatively high cost for preparation.
      The development and use of novel bispecific antibodies against the G protein of rabies virus is desirable in the art.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002705304,"BACKGROUND ART
      RGM (repulsive guidance molecule), which is a GPI-anchored membrane protein with a molecular weight of about 33 kDa, has been initially identified as an axon guidance molecule in the visual system (see Non-Patent Document 1). The RGM family includes three members called RGMa, RGMb and RGMc. Among them, RGMa is re-expressed after central nervous system injury in adult humans and rats as well as at developmental stage, and RGMa inhibition in rat accelerates neurite outgrowth after spinal cord injury and promotes functional recovery (see Non-Patent Document 2). Thus. RGMa is thought to be a neurite inhibitor after central nervous system injury.
      RGMa also has been reported to have effects in the immune system. RGMa is expressed on dendritic cells and acts on T cells, thereby enhancing adhesion of T cells to ICAM-1 and fibronectin and inducing cytokine production (
       4). In a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, administration of anti-RGMa antibody suppresses symptoms due to encephalomyelitis and also shows effects of suppressing onset and relapse. It is thought, that anti-RGMa antibody binds to RGMa expressed on dendritic cells to inhibit the activation of T cells, thereby exerting effects on multiple sclerosis.
      The signal transduction mechanism of RGMa is also being elucidated, and neogenin protein has been reported as an RGMa receptor (Patent Document 3). Neogenin is a single-transmembrane protein expressed on neurons and T cells.
      RGMa binds to neogenin on a cell membrane to induce intracellular RhoA activation and Ras inactivation, thereby providing a neurite outgrowth inhibitory effect. Meanwhile, neogenin is known to cause apoptosis in the absence of RGMa binding in a developing chicken brain (Matsunaga et al., Dev. Growth Differ. 46, 481, 2004). Thus, the RGMa/neogenin pathway is thought to have two conflicting effects of promoting neuronal survival, which is a favorable effect for nerve regeneration, and of inhibiting neurite outgrowth, a negative effect.
      As a pharmaceutical agent targeting RGM, Patent Document 1 discloses an axon regeneration promoting agent containing an anti-RGM neutralizing antibody as an active ingredient. Patent Documents 2 and 3 disclose a therapeutic agent for mechanical damage to brain and spinal cord, an anti-RGM antibody that regulates the binding of RGM to its receptor neogenin. Patent Document 4 discloses medical uses of anti-RGM antibody such as for multiple sclerosis Patent Document 5 discloses therapeutic uses of anti-RGM antibody for diseases including multiple sclerosis, mammalian brain injury, spinal cord injury, apoplexy, neurodegenerative disease and schizophrenia. Furthermore, Patent Document 6 discloses therapeutic uses of RGM modulators such as anti-RGM antibody for spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, and Non-Patent Document 3 discloses a therapeutic use for progressive multiple sclerosis.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002625011,"BACKGROUND
      Hepcidin, a peptide hormone typically existing in two forms made of either 20 or 25 amino acids, is expressed and secreted by a number of cells in response to iron loading and inflammation. Hepcidin is produced predominantly in hepatocytes of the liver, plays a central role in the regulation of iron homeostasis, acts as an antimicrobial peptide and is directly or indirectly involved in the development of most iron-deficiency/overload syndromes. A major action of hepcidin is to internalize and degrade the iron exporter ferroportin, which is expressed on all iron-exporting cells. Hepcidin directly binds to ferroportin. A high hepcidin level thus leads to the suppression of intestinal iron absorption and iron release from macrophages and hepatocytes, while a low concentration of hepcidin leads to acceleration of iron release from these cells.
      Hepcidin is also suspected to play role in pathogenesis of anemia of inflammation and iron-deficiency anemia. Anemia of inflammation, also known as anemia of chronic disease (ACD) or anemia of chronic disorders, currently is the most frequent anemia among hospitalized patients and a common syndrome complicating many infectious, non-infectious inflammatory and neoplastic disorders. ACD is a normocytic, normochromic anemia characterized by decreased iron and iron-binding capacity (transferrin), increased ferritin and the presence of iron in bone marrow macrophages, indicating impaired mobilization of iron from its stores. While in anemia of inflammation hepcidin levels are increased, in iron-deficiency anemia low hepcidin levels are found. Hence, hepcidin could be used as a marker to distinguish these diseases. Hepcidin may also be a useful marker for screening, prognosis and monitoring hereditary hemochromatosis and iron loading anemias. Hepcidin levels may further be useful in monitoring EPO treatment and predicting a response to EPO.
      Methods of isolating, analyzing and quantifying hepcidin as well as agents for the treatment of diseases and conditions associated with hepcidin have been described in international patent applications WO 2008/011158, WO 2008/097461, WO 2009/094551A1, WO 2009/139822, WO 2009/058797 and WO 2010/017070. However, no hepcidin-binding protein having the features attendant to the proteins provided by present invention has been previously described.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

      Cyclin-dependent protein kinase CDK8, along with CDK19 isoform, which is closely related thereto based on its structural and functional characteristics, is an oncogenic kinase that regulates transcription (Xu, W. & Ji, J. Y. (2011) Dysregulation of CDK8 and Cyclin C in tumorigenesis, J. Genet. Genomics 38, 439-452; Galbraith, M D, et al. (2010) CDK8: a positive regulator of transcription, Transcription. 1, 4-12; Firestein, R. & Hahn, Wsee prev.C. (2009) Revving the Throttle on an oncogene: CDK8 takes the driver seat, Cancer Res 69, 7899-7901). In contrast to the more well-known members of the CDK family (such as CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4/6), CDK8 does not play a role in the regulation of the cell cycle, however, the knockout of the CDK8 gene in embryonic stem cells leads to a halt in embryo development (Adler, A. S., et al. (2012) CDK8 maintains tumor de-differentiation and embryonic stem cell pluripotency, Cancer Res. 72, 2129-2139) because of its important role in the formation of the pluripotent stem cell phenotype (Firestein, R., et al. (2008) CDK8 is a colorectal cancer oncogene that regulates beta-catenin activity, Nature 455, 547-551). It should be noted that blocking CDK8 does not inhibit normal cell growth (Adler, A. S., et al. (2012) CDK8 maintains tumor differentiation and embryonic stem cell pluripotency, Cancer Res. 72, 2129-2139, Kapoor, A., et al. (2010) The histone variant macroH2A suppresses melanoma progression through regulation of CDK8, Nature 468, 1105-1109). The role of CDK8 in carcinogenesis is associated with its unique function as a regulator of several transcription factors (Xu, W. & Ji, J. Y. (2011) Dysregulation of CDK8 and Cyclin C in tumorigenesis, J. Genet. Genomics 38, 439-452). High expression of CDK8 was detected during colon cancer (Firestein, R., et al. (2010) CDK8 expression in 470 colorectal cancers in relation to beta-catenin activation, other molecular alterations and patient survival, Int. J. Cancer 126, 2863-2873) and melanoma (Kapoor, A., et al. (2010) The histone variant macroH2A suppresses melanoma progression through regulation of CDK8, Nature 468, 1105-1109), although, with these types of cancer, increased expression of CDK8 is observed in ˜50% of cases. A similar situation is observed with breast cancer (E. Broude, et al. (2015) Expression of CDK8 and CDK8-interacting genes as potential biomarkers in breast cancer, Curr. Cancer Drug Targets, 15 (8), 739-749). Increased CDK8 expression is associated with poor prognosis for colon cancer (Gyorffy, B., et al. (2010) An online survival analysis tool to rapidly assess the effect of 22,277 genes on breast cancer prognosis using microarray data of 1, 809 patients, Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 123, 725-731).
      Known mechanisms associated with CDK8 during cancer include upregulation of the Wnt/[beta] catenin pathway (Kapoor, A., et al. (2010) The histone variant macroH2A suppresses melanoma progression through regulation of CDK8, Nature 468, 1105-1109; Alarcon, C., et al. (2009) Nuclear CDKs drive Smad transcriptional activation and turnover in BMP and TGF-beta pathways, Cell 139, 757-769), growth factor-induced transcription (DiDonato, J. A., et al. (2012) NF-kappaB and the link between inflammation and cancer, Immunol. Rev. 246, 379-400), and the TGF-beta signaling pathway (Acharyya, S., et al. (2012) A CXCL1 paracrine network links cancer chemoresistance and metastasis, Cell 150, 165-178). It has also been shown that CDK8 can support the pluripotent phenotype of embryonic stem cells, which can be associated with the cancer stem cell phenotype (Firestein, R., et al. (2008) CDK8 is a colorectal cancer oncogene that regulates beta-catenin activity, Nature 455, 547-551). Chemotherapeutic drugs that cause DNA damage induce TNF-α, an activator of the NF-kB transcription factor (Fabian et al. (2005) A small molecule-kinase interaction map for clinical kinase inhibitors, Nat. Biotechnol. 23, 329-336), in endothelial cells and in other stromal elements of the tumor microenvironment. Stromal TNF-α activator affects tumor cells, where it induces NF-kB-mediated production of CXCL1 and CXCL2 cytokines, which contribute to the survival and growth of tumor cells. CXCL1/2 attract myeloid cells to the tumor by binding to the CXCR2 receptor on the surface of myeloid cells. Myeloid cells then secrete small calcium-binding proteins S 100A8 and A9, which are associated with the processes of chronic inflammation and tumor growth. S 100A8/9 affect tumor cells, promoting metastasis thereof as well as survival secondary to chemotherapy (Huang, et al. (2012) MED 12 Controls the response to multiple cancer drugs through regulation of TGF-b receptor signaling, Cell 151, 937-950).
      Currently, it is important to search for new compounds inhibiting cyclin-dependent protein kinases CDK8/19.

200970738,"BACKGROUND
      The internet affords every person more or less anonymity and with it, the possibility of also adopting various identities. Such identities are associated, on the internet, with an e-mail or IP address. E-mail addresses last as long as the user needs them. IP addresses can dynamically change and are not directly associated with a person. Furthermore, IP addresses can also be utilized by multiple people at the same time.
      A typical internet user normally utilizes no fewer than three different e-mail addresses, for example, professional, private, and the so-called throw-away address, i.e. those used to register for secured websites. Each of these email addresses is normally associated to a specific identity and with it contact data, (for example, name, private address, business address).
      In business, the trend has become to separate private and business use of the internet and email. Often, business computers, for reasons of data security, should not be used for private purposes. Thus, a trend to a second (business) identity arises.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      The present invention relates to a method for generating a physical address. The method includes providing an email address and querying a database for the email address. The method also includes identifying the physical address associated with said email address.
      The present invention also relates to a method for establishing a relational database. The method includes obtaining a user's actual name associated with that user's email address. The method also includes associating the user's physical address with the user's email address.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200870260,"BACKGROUND ART
      Atherosclerotic diseases, such as myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction, account for major part of the cause of death in Japan, along with cancers. Risk factors for arteriosclerosis include hyperlipemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, hyperuricemia, aging, stress, and the like, which are interrelated to cause angiopathy. Thus even if each risk factor is low, cumulation of the factors additively and synergistically increases the risk.
      There have conventionally been identified various physiological functions of fermented milk, lactic acid bacteria, and enzymatic hydrolysates of milk. For example, Patent Publications 1 and 2 report the cholesterol-lowering effect, Patent Publication 3 and Non-Patent Publication 1 report the hypotensive effect, and Patent Publication 4 reports the anti-stress effect. Patent Publication 5 describes that a casein hydrolysate, which contains free amino acids and peptides and has been obtained by hydrolyzing animal milk casein to have an average chain length of not longer than 2.1 in terms of the number of amino acid residues, has angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity or hypotensive effect. These publications provide information regarding mitigation of each risk factor for arteriosclerosis.
      On the other hand, it is envisaged that mere mitigation of one of the above risk factors will not result in prevention of onset of arteriosclerosis. For example, Non-patent Publications 2 and 3 report the absence of interrelationship between the blood cholesterol level and onset of arteriosclerosis, Non-patent Publication 4 teaches that suppression of hypertension does not change the degree of arteriosclerosis, and Non-patent Publication 5 describes that administration of an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) does not result in an arteriosclerosis inhibitory effect.
      Accordingly, even though the particular casein hydrolysate disclosed in Patent Publication 5 is known to mitigate each risk factor for arteriosclerosis, this does not mean that the disclosed particular casein hydrolysate has an anti-arteriosclerotic effect.
      An artery is mainly composed of the adventitia, the media including the smooth muscle layer which causes the blood vessel to dilate and constrict, and the intima in direct contact with blood and including the endothelial cell layer, which commands the smooth muscle layer in the media. The endothelial cells in the intima are recently being revealed to control various commands relating to vascular functions, such as fibrinolysis and coagulation of blood, dilation and constriction of blood vessels, inhibition and development of inflammation, and proliferation and regression of blood vessels. The vascular endothelial functions are believed to be associated with arteriosclerosis and various other diseases. Thus it is expected that improvement of vascular endothelial functions may prevent arteriosclerosis.
      Arteriosclerosis is a pathology wherein the arterial wall is thickened to loose its elasticity. In particular, atherosclerosis is characterized by arterial subintimal spot-like thickening (atheroma), and produces symptoms of reduced or disrupted blood flow. Such symptoms are recently considered to be attributed to injury or decreased function of vascular endothelial cells.
      Therefore, inhibition of vascular endothelial thickening may be expected to mitigate or prevent onset of atherosclerosis.
      Diagnostic measurement of the vascular endothelial functions in human under harmless conditions is known to be performed by plethysmography, as disclosed in Non-patent Publication 6. Plethysmography is a method for determining the functions of endothelial cells through vasodilatability, utilizing the phenomenon that, when the arterial blood flow is temporarily stopped, the amount of the vasodilating substance generated and released by the endothelial cells is increased, which transiently increases the blood flow, and when the endothelial functions are impaired, the release of the vasodilating substance is lowered, which results in reduced blood flow.

      Recently, numerous molecular targeted drugs that act specifically on a specific molecule have been developed for use as anticancer drugs. In particular, development has been proceeding on various antibody drugs having, as antigens, molecules specifically expressed in certain cancer cells or molecules exhibiting increased expression in cancer cells. In the development of such antibody drugs, a comparison is first made between expression of mRNA in cancer tissue collected at the time of surgery and expression of mRNA in normal tissue collected from a nearby site, molecules specifically expressed only in cancer tissue or molecules exhibiting increased expression in cancer tissue are identified, and antibodies are then prepared by using those molecules as antigens.
      Colon cancer is manifest from cells of the intestinal mucosa. Cetuximab has previously been developed for use against colon cancer as an antibody drug that targets epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (Non-Patent Documents 1 to 3). However, since EGFR is also expressed in normal tissue, Cetuximab also has the potential to act on normal tissue, thereby resulting in the desire to develop a molecular targeted drug that targets molecules more specifically expressed during colon cancer. With regard to this point, since there is only a small amount of mucosal tissue in which colon cancer occurs, there has been the problem of it being difficult to identify a target molecule by comparing cancerous mucosal cells and normal mucosal cells.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
Technical Problem
      An object of the present invention is to provide an anticancer drug capable of treating cancer by finding a target molecule specifically expressed in cancer cells and by specifically acting on the target molecule, and to provide a cancer testing method comprising a step of measuring the target molecule in a sample.
Solution to Problem
      In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the inventors of the present invention compared mRNA expression between various types of colon cancer cell lines and normal mucosal cells contained in the washing liquid obtained during colonoscopy by analyzing using a DNA microarray to seek out molecules that are only expressed in colon cancer cell lines. As a result, transmembrane protein 180 (TMEM-180) was identified as a protein that is expressed in all colon cancer cell lines but which is not observed to be expressed in the cells of healthy subjects. Moreover, in addition to confirming that TMEM-180 is not expressed in normal colon tissue by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization, TMEM-180 was also confirmed to not be expressed in prominent normal tissues, thereby confirming TMEM-180 to be an ideal molecule for use as a target of anticancer drugs and as an indicator in cancer testing.
      Antibody to TMEM-180 was produced, and this antibody was confirmed to demonstrate a cytocidal effect on colon cancer cells as well as be able to detect recurrence in particular with greater sensitivity than conventional colon cancer markers, thereby leading to completion of the present invention.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200870244,"BACKGROUND
      Incubation of proteins or lipids with aldose sugars results in nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of amino groups on proteins to form Amadori adducts. Over time, the adducts undergo additional rearrangements, dehydrations, and cross-linking with other proteins to form complexes known as Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). Factors which promote formation of AGEs include delayed protein turnover (e.g. as in amyloidoses), accumulation of macromolecules having high lysine content, and high blood glucose levels (e.g. as in diabetes) (Hori et al, J. Biol. Chem. 270: 25752-761, (1995)). AGEs have been implicated in a variety of disorders including complications associated with diabetes and normal aging.
      AGEs display specific and saturable binding to cell surface receptors on monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells of the microvasculature, smooth muscle cells, mesengial cells, and neurons. The Receptor for Advanced Glycated Endproducts (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin-supergene family of molecules. The extracellular (N-terminal) domain of RAGE includes three immunoglobulin-type regions: one V (variable) type domain followed by two C-type (constant) domains (Neeper et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:14998-15004 (1992); Schmidt et al., Circ. ( Suppl.) 96#194 (1997)). A single transmembrane spanning domain and a short, highly charged cytosolic tail follow the extracellular domain. The N-terminal, extracellular domain can be isolated by proteolysis of RAGE or by molecular biological approaches to generate soluble RAGE (sRAGE) comprised of the V and C domains.
      RAGE is expressed on multiple cell types including leukocytes, neurons, microglial cells and vascular endothelium (e.g., Hori et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270:25752-761 (1995)). Increased levels of RAGE are also found in aging tissues (Schleicher et al., J. Clin. Invest., 99 (3): 457-468 (1997)), and the diabetic retina, vasculature and kidney (Schmidt et al., Nature Med., 1:1002-1004 (1995)).
      In addition to AGEs, other compounds can bind to and modulate RAGE. RAGE binds to multiple functionally and structurally diverse ligands including amyloid beta (Aβ), serum amyloid A (SAA), Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs), S100 (a proinflammatory member of the Calgranulin family), carboxymethyl lysine (CML), amphoterin and CD11b/CD18 (Bucciarelli et al., Cell Mol. Life. Sci., 59:1117-128 (2002); Chavakis et al., Microbes Infect., 6:1219-1225 (2004); Kokkola et al., Scand. J. Immunol., 61:1-9 (2005); Schmidt et al., J. Clin. Invest., 108:949-955 (2001); Rocken et al., Am. J. Pathol., 162:1213-1220 (2003)).
      Binding of ligands such as AGEs, S100/calgranulin, β-amyloid, CML (N′-Carboxymethyl lysine), and amphoterin to RAGE has been shown to modify expression of a variety of genes. These interactions may then initiate signal transduction mechanisms including p38 activation, p21ras, MAP kinases, Erk1-2 phosphorylation, and the activation of the transcriptional mediator of inflammatory signaling, NF-κB (Yeh et al., Diabetes, 50:1495-1504 (2001)). For example, in many cell types, interaction between RAGE and its ligands can generate oxidative stress, which thereby results in activation of the free radical sensitive transcription factor NF-κB, and the activation of NF-κB regulated genes, such as the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. Furthermore, RAGE expression is upregulated via NF-κB and shows increased expression at sites of inflammation or oxidative stress (Tanaka et al., J. Biol. Chem., 275:25781-25790 (2000)). Thus, an ascending and often detrimental spiral may be fueled by a positive feedback loop initiated by ligand binding.
      Activation of RAGE in different tissues and organs can lead to a number of pathophysiological consequences. RAGE has been implicated in a variety of conditions including: acute and chronic inflammation (Hofmann et al., Cell 97:889-901 (1999)), the development of diabetic late complications such as increased vascular permeability (Wautier et al., J. Clin. Invest., 97:238-243 (1995)), nephropathy (Teillet et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 11: 1488-1497 (2000)), arteriosclerosis (Vlassara et. al, The Finnish Medical Society DUODECIM, Ann. Med., 28:419-426 (1996)), and retinopathy (Hammes et al., Diabetologia, 42:603-607 (1999)). RAGE has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Yan et al., Nature, 382:685-691 (1996)), and in tumor invasion and metastasis (Taguchi et al., Nature, 405:354-357 (2000)).
      Despite the broad expression of RAGE and its apparent pleiotropic role in multiple diverse disease models, RAGE does not appear to be essential to normal development. For example, RAGE knockout mice are without an overt abnormal phenotype, suggesting that while RAGE can play a role in disease pathology when stimulated chronically, inhibition of RAGE does not appear to contribute to any unwanted acute phenotype (Liliensiek et al., J. Clin. Invest., 113:1641-50 (2004)).
      Antagonizing binding of physiological ligands to RAGE may down-regulate the pathophysiological changes brought about by excessive concentrations of AGEs and other RAGE ligands. By reducing binding of endogenous ligands to RAGE, symptoms associated with RAGE-mediated disorders may be reduced. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) is able to effectively antagonize the binding of RAGE ligands to RAGE. However, sRAGE can have a half-life when administered in vivo that may be too short to be therapeutically useful for one or more disorders. Thus, there is a need to develop compounds that antagonize the binding of AGEs and other physiological ligands to the RAGE receptor where the compound has a desirable pharmacokinetic profile.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002611202,"BACKGROUND
      Photoreceptors are the first neurons in the retina to receive and process visual information, converting visible electromagnetic radiation into hyperpolarized responses through phototransduction. The overwhelming majority of inherited retinal diseases result in the loss of these cells, either directly, such as in dominant mutations that affect rhodopsin protein folding, or indirectly, such as in recessive mutations that affect retinal recycling pathways in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
      AAV belongs to the Parvoviridae family and Dependovirus genus, whose members require co-infection with a helper virus such as adenovirus to promote replication, and AAV establishes a latent infection in the absence of a helper. Virions are composed of a 25 nm icosahedral capsid encompassing a 4.9 kb single-stranded DNA genome with two open reading frames: rep and cap. The non-structural rep gene encodes four regulatory proteins essential for viral replication, whereas cap encodes three structural proteins (VP1-3) that assemble into a 60-mer capsid shell. This viral capsid mediates the ability of AAV vectors to overcome many of the biological barriers of viral transduction—including cell surface receptor binding, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and unpackaging in the nucleus.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002766209,"BACKGROUND
      Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, quality and strength associated with aging. Humans begin to lose muscle mass and function at some point in the third decade of life. This loss of muscle mass typically accelerates around age 75. Sarcopenia develops in both physically active and physically inactive people. As the average human lifespan continues to increase, sarcopenia is becoming a significant health concern. The loss of muscle mass from sarcopenia may lead to poor balance, reduced gait speed and frailty. Individuals suffering from sarcopenia are more susceptible to injury and disability, and may be unable to live independently as a result. The spread of sarcopenia will likely result in increases in health care and assisted living expenses.
      Sarcopenia has been considered to be an inevitable result of aging and the natural deterioration of the body over time. The primary treatment for sarcopenia is exercise. Physical exercise, particularly resistance training or strength training, can reduce the impact of sarcopenia. Testosterone, anabolic steroids, ghrelin, vitamin D, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), myostatin, selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), urocortin II (Ucn2) and hormone replacement therapy have been investigated or are being studied as potential treatments for sarcopenia. Despite this research, there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents for treating sarcopenia.
      A recent study has identified a causal link between cellular senescence and age-related disorders, such as sarcopenia. A research team at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., demonstrated that effects of aging in mice could be delayed by eliminating senescent cells in their fat and muscle tissues without overt side effects (Baker, D. J. et al., “Clearance of p16 Ink4a-positive senescent cells delays ageing-associated disorders”, Nature, Vol. 479, pp. 232-236, (2011)). Elimination of senescent cells in transgenic mice was shown to substantially delay the onset of sarcopenia and cataracts, and to reduce senescence indicators in skeletal muscle and the eye. The study established that life-long and late-life treatment of transgenic mice for removal of senescent cells has no negative side effects and selectively delays age-related phenotypes that depend on cells (Id., page 234, col. 2, line 16 through page 235, col. 1, line 2). The authors theorized that removal of senescent cells may represent an avenue for treating or delaying age-related diseases in humans and improving healthy human lifespan (Id., page 235, col. 2, lines 38-51).
      Senescent cells are cells that are partially-functional or non-functional and are in a state of irreversible proliferative arrest. Senescence is a distinct state of a cell, and is associated with biomarkers, such as activation of the biomarker p16 Ink4a, and expression of β-galactosidase.
      Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs; also referred to AGE-modified proteins, or glycation end-products) arise from a non-enzymatic reaction of sugars with protein side-chains in aging cells (Ando, K. et al., Membrane Proteins of Human Erythrocytes Are Modified by Advanced Glycation End Products during Aging in the Circulation, Biochem Biophys Res Commun., Vol. 258, 123, 125 (1999)). This process begins with a reversible reaction between the reducing sugar and the amino group to form a Schiff base, which proceeds to form a covalently-bonded Amadori rearrangement product. Once formed, the Amadori product undergoes further rearrangement to produce AGEs. Hyperglycemia, caused by diabetes mellitus (DM), and oxidative stress promote this post-translational modification of membrane proteins (Lindsey J B, et al., “Receptor For Advanced Glycation End-Products (RAGE) and soluble RAGE (sRAGE): Cardiovascular Implications,” Diabetes Vascular Disease Research, Vol. 6(1), 7-14, (2009)). AGEs have been associated with several pathological conditions including diabetic complications, inflammation, retinopathy, nephropathy, atherosclerosis, stroke, endothelial cell dysfunction, and neurodegenerative disorders (Bierhaus A, “AGEs and their interaction with AGE-receptors in vascular disease and diabetes mellitus. I. The AGE concept,” Cardiovasc Res, Vol. 37(3), 586-600 (1998)).
      AGE-modified proteins are also a marker of senescent cells. This association between glycation end-product and senescence is well known in the art. See, for example, Gruber, L. (WO 2009/143411, 26 Nov. 2009), Ando, K. et al. (Membrane Proteins of Human Erythrocytes Are Modified by Advanced Glycation End Products during Aging in the Circulation, Biochem Biophys Res Commun., Vol. 258, 123, 125 (1999)), Ahmed, E. K. et al. (“Protein Modification and Replicative Senescence of WI-38 Human Embryonic Fibroblasts” Aging Cells, vol. 9, 252, 260 (2010)), Vlassara, H. et al. (Advanced Glycosylation Endproducts on Erythrocyte Cell Surface Induce Receptor-Mediated Phagocytosis by Macrophages, J. Exp. Med., Vol. 166, 539, 545 (1987)) and Vlassara et al. (“High-affinity-receptor-mediated Uptake and Degradation of Glucose-modified Proteins: A Potential Mechanism for the Removal of Senescent Macromolecules” Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol. 82, 5588, 5591 (1985)). Furthermore, Ahmed, E. K. et al. indicates that glycation end-products are “one of the major causes of spontaneous damage to cellular and extracellular proteins” (Ahmed, E. K. et al., see above, page 353). Accordingly, the accumulation of glycation end-product is associated with senescence and lack of function.

Definitions
      The term “sarcopenia” means the syndrome characterized by the presence of (1) low muscle mass and (2) low muscle function (low muscle strength or reduced physical performance). Muscle mass may be measured by body imaging techniques, such as computed tomography scanning (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA); bioimpedance analysis (BIA); body potassium measurement, such as total body potassium (TBK) or partial body potassium (PBK); or anthropometric measurements, such as mid-upper arm circumference, skin fold thickness or calf circumference. Preferably, muscle mass is measured by CT scan, MRI or DXA. Muscle strength may be measured by handgrip strength, knee flexion/extension or peak expiratory flow. Preferably, muscle strength is measured by handgrip strength. Physical performance may be measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery, gait speed measurement, timed get-up-and-go (TGUG) or the stair climb power test. Preferably, physical performance is measured by gait speed measurement. A subject may be identified as having sarcopenia or in need of treatment if (1) the subject is at least 25 years old and (2) his or her measured muscle mass and measured muscle function are two standard deviations or more below the mean value for healthy 25 year olds of the same gender and no alternative pathology has been identified to account for the reduced muscle mass and reduced muscle function. Preferably, a subject being treated for sarcopenia is at least 40 years old. More preferably, a subject being treated for sarcopenia is at least 50 years old. Most preferably, a subject being treated for sarcopenia is at least 60 years old. Alternatively, a subject may be identified as having sarcopenia or in need of treatment if (1) his or her gait speed is less than 1.0 m/s across a 4 m course and (2) he or she has an objectively measured low muscle mass, such as, for example, an appendicular mass relative to the square of height less than or equal to 7.23 kg/m 2 for male subjects or less than or equal to 5.67 kg/m 2 for female subjects (Fielding, R. A., et al., “Sarcopenia: an undiagnosed condition in older adults. Current consensus definition: prevalence, etiology, and consequences”, Journal of the American Medical Directors Association, Vol. 12(4), pp. 249-256 (May 2011).
      The terms “advanced glycation end-product,” “AGE,” “AGE-modified protein or peptide,” “glycation end-product” and “AGE antigen” refer to modified proteins or peptides that are formed as the result of the reaction of sugars with protein side chains that further rearrange and form irreversible cross-links. This process begins with a reversible reaction between a reducing sugar and an amino group to form a Schiff base, which proceeds to form a covalently-bonded Amadori rearrangement product. Once formed, the Amadori product undergoes further rearrangement to produce AGEs. AGE-modified proteins and antibodies to AGE-modified proteins are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,704 to Bucala (“Bucala”) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,380,165 to Al-Abed et al. (“Al-Abed”). Glycated proteins or peptides that have not undergone the necessary rearrangement to form AGEs, such as N-deoxyfructosyllysine found on glycated albumin, are not AGEs. AGEs may be identified by the presence of AGE modifications (also referred to as AGE epitopes or AGE moieties) such as 2-(2-furoyl)-4(5)-(2-furanyl)-1H-imidazole (“FFI”); 5-hydroxymethyl-1-alkylpyrrole-2-carbaldehyde (“Pyrraline”); 1-alkyl-2-formyl-3,4-diglycosyl pyrrole (“AFGP”), a non-fluorescent model AGE; carboxymethyllysine; and pentosidine. ALI, another AGE, is described in Al-Abed.
      “An antibody that binds to an AGE-modified protein on a cell”, “anti-AGE antibody” or “AGE antibody” means an antibody or other protein that binds to an AGE-modified protein or peptide and includes a constant region of an antibody, where the protein or peptide which has been AGE-modified is a protein or peptide normally found bound on the surface of a cell, preferably a mammalian cell, more preferably a human, cat, dog, horse, camelid (for example, camel or alpaca), cattle, sheep, or goat cell. “An antibody that binds to an AGE-modified protein on a cell”, “anti-AGE antibody” or “AGE antibody” does not include an antibody or other protein which binds with the same specificity and selectivity to both the AGE-modified protein or peptide, and the same non-AGE-modified protein or peptide (that is, the presence of the AGE modification does not increase binding). AGE-modified albumin is not an AGE-modified protein on a cell, because albumin is not a protein normally found bound on the surface of cells. “An antibody that binds to an AGE-modified protein on a cell”, “anti-AGE antibody” or “AGE antibody” only includes those antibodies which lead to removal, destruction, or death of the cell. Also included are antibodies which are conjugated, for example to a toxin, drug, or other chemical or particle. Preferably, the antibodies are monoclonal antibodies, but polyclonal antibodies are also possible.
      The term “senescent cell” means a cell which is in a state of irreversible proliferative arrest and expresses one or more biomarkers of senescence, such as activation of p16 Ink4a or expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase. Also included are cells which express one or more biomarkers of senescence, do not proliferate in vivo, but may proliferate in vitro under certain conditions, such as some satellite cells found in the muscles of ALS patients.
      The term “increasing health span” means reducing age-related phenotypes. Age-related phenotypes include, for example, sarcopenia, cataracts, loss of adipose tissue and lordokyphosis.
      The term “variant” means a nucleotide, protein or amino acid sequence different from the specifically identified sequences, wherein one or more nucleotides, proteins or amino acid residues is deleted, substituted or added. Variants may be naturally-occurring allelic variants, or non-naturally-occurring variants. Variants of the identified sequences may retain some or all of the functional characteristics of the identified sequences.
      The term “percent (%) sequence identity” is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical to the amino acid residues in a reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Preferably, % sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN-2. The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program is publicly available from Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, Calif.), or may be compiled from the source code, which has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office and is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, including digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary.
      In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: 100 times the fraction X/Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. Where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. Unless specifically stated otherwise, all % amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained using the ALIGN-2 computer program.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
201100355,"BACKGROUND
      The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by a better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is protein kinases.
      Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell. (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.: 1995). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (See, for example, Hanks, S. K., Hunter, T., FASEB J. 1995, 9, 576-596; Knighton et al., Science 1991, 253, 407-414; Hiles et al., Cell 1992, 70, 419-429; Kunz et al., Cell 1993, 73, 585-596; Garcia-Bustos et al., EMBO J. 1994, 13, 2352-2361).
      In general, protein kinases mediate intracellular signaling by affecting a phosphoryl transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. These phosphorylation events are ultimately triggered in response to a variety of extracellular and other stimuli. Examples of such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and H 2O 2), cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)), and growth factors (e.g., granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An extracellular stimulus may affect one or more cellular responses related to cell growth, migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle. Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events as described above. These diseases include, but are not limited to, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents.
      Initiation, progression, and completion of the mammalian cell cycle are regulated by various cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, which are critical for cell growth. These complexes comprise at least a catalytic (the CDK itself) and a regulatory (cyclin) subunit. Some of the more important complexes for cell cycle regulation include cyclin A (CDK1—also known as cdc2, and CDK2), cyclin B1-B3 (CDK1) and cyclin D1-D3 (CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6), cyclin E (CDK2). Each of these complexes is involved in a particular phase of the cell cycle. Not all members of the CDK family are involved exclusively in cell cycle control, however. Thus CDKs 7, 8, and 9 are implicated in the regulation of transcription, and CDK5 plays a role in neuronal and secretory cell function.
      The activity of CDKs is regulated post-translationally, by transitory associations with other proteins, and by alterations of their intracellular localization. Tumor development is closely associated with genetic alteration and deregulation of CDKs and their regulators, suggesting that inhibitors of CDKs may be useful anti-cancer therapeutics. Indeed, early results suggest that transformed and normal cells differ in their requirement for, e.g., cyclin A/CDK2 and that it may be possible to develop novel antineoplastic agents devoid of the general host toxicity observed with conventional cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs. While inhibition of cell cycle-related CDKs is clearly relevant in, e.g., oncology applications, this may not be the case for the inhibition of RNA polymerase-regulating CDKs. On the other hand, inhibition of CDK9/cyclin T function was recently linked to prevention of HIV replication and the discovery of new CDK biology thus continues to open up new therapeutic indications for CDK inhibitors (Sausville, E. A. Trends Molec. Med. 2002, 8, S32-S37).
      The function of CDKs is to phosphorylate and thus activate or deactivate certain proteins, including e.g. retinoblastoma proteins, lamins, histone H1, and components of the mitotic spindle. The catalytic step mediated by CDKs involves a phospho-transfer reaction from ATP to the macromolecular enzyme substrate. Several groups of compounds (reviewed in e.g. Fischer, P. M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2001, 4, 623-634) have been found to possess anti-proliferative properties by virtue of CDK-specific ATP antagonism.
      At a molecular level mediation of cdk/cyclin complex activity requires a series of stimulatory and inhibitory phosphorylation, or dephosphorylation, events. Cdk phosphorylation is performed by a group of cdk activating kinases (CAKs) and/or kinases such as weel, Myt1 and Mik1. Dephosphorylation is performed by phosphatases such as cdc25(a & c), pp2a, or KAP. Cdk/cyclin complex activity may be further regulated by two families of endogenous cellular proteinaceous inhibitors: the Kip/Cip family, or the INK family. The INK proteins specifically bind cdk4 and cdk6. p16 ink4 (also known as MTS1) is a potential tumour suppressor gene that is mutated, or deleted, in a large number of primary cancers. The Kip/Cip family contains proteins such as p21 Cip1,Waf1, p27 Kip1 and p57 kip2. As discussed previously p21 is induced by p53 and is able to inactivate the cdk2/cyclin(E/A) and cdk4/cyclin(D1/D2/D3) complexes. Atypically low levels of p27 expression have been observed in breast, colon and prostate cancers. Conversely over expression of cyclin E in solid tumours has been shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis. Over expression of cyclin D1 has been associated with oesophageal, breast, squamous, and non-small cell lung carcinomas.
      The pivotal roles of cdks, and their associated proteins, in co-ordinating and driving the cell cycle in proliferating cells have been outlined above. Some of the biochemical pathways in which cdks play a key role have also been described. The development of monotherapies for the treatment of proliferative disorders, such as cancers, using therapeutics targeted generically at cdks, or at specific cdks, is therefore potentially highly desirable. Cdk inhibitors could conceivably also be used to treat other conditions such as viral infections, autoimmune diseases and neuro-degenerative diseases, amongst others. Cdk targeted therapeutics may also provide clinical benefits in the treatment of the previously described diseases when used in combination therapy with either existing, or new, therapeutic agents. Cdk targeted anticancer therapies could potentially have advantages over many current antitumour agents as they would not directly interact with DNA and should therefore reduce the risk of secondary tumour development.
Thus, there is a continued need to find new therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. Accordingly, there is a great need to develop inhibitors of protein kinases, such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002768699,"BACKGROUND
      The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped, partially double-stranded DNA virus. The compact 3.2 kb HBV genome consists of four overlapping open reading frames (ORF), which encode for the core, polymerase (Pol), envelope and X-proteins. The Pol ORF is the longest and the envelope ORF is located within it, while the X and core ORFs overlap with the Pol ORF. The lifecycle of HBV has two main events: 1) generation of closed circular DNA (cccDNA) from relaxed circular (RC DNA), and 2) reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) to produce RC DNA. Prior to the infection of host cells, the HBV genome exists within the virion as RC DNA. It has been determined that HBV virions are able to gain entry into host cells by non-specifically binding to the negatively charged proteoglycans present on the surface of human hepatocytes (Schulze, Hepatology, 46, (2007), 1759-68) and via the specific binding of HBV surface antigens (HBsAg) to the hepatocyte sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) receptor (Yan, J Virol, 87, (2013), 7977-91). The control of viral infection needs a tight surveillance of the host innate immune system which could respond within minutes to hours after infection to impact on the initial growth of the virus and limit the development of a chronic and persistent infection. Despite the available current treatments based on IFN and nucleos(t)ide analogues, the HBV infection remains a major health problem worldwide which concerns an estimated 350 million chronic carriers who have a higher risk of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
      The secretion of antiviral cytokines in response to a HBV infection by the hepatocytes and/or the intra-hepatic immune cells plays a central role in the viral clearance of the infected liver. However, chronically infected patients only display a weak immune response due to various escape strategies adopted by the virus to counteract the host cell recognition systems and the subsequent antiviral responses.
      Many observations showed that several HBV viral proteins could counteract the initial host cellular response by interfering with the viral recognition signaling system and subsequently the interferon (IFN) antiviral activity. Among these, the excessive secretion of HBV empty subviral particles (SVPs, HBsAg) are thought to participate to the maintenance of the immunological tolerant state observed in chronically infected patients (CHB). The persistent exposure to HBsAg and other viral antigens can lead to HBV-specific T-cell deletion or to progressive functional impairment (Kondo, Journal of Immunology (1993), 150, 4659-4671; Kondo, Journal of Medical Virology (2004), 74, 425-433; Fisicaro, Gastroenterology, (2010), 138, 682-93;). Moreover HBsAg has been reported to suppress the function of immune cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells by direct interaction (Op den Brouw, Immunology, (2009b), 126, 280-9; Woltman, PLoS One, (2011), 6, e15324; Shi, J Viral Hepat. (2012), 19, e26-33; Kondo, ISRN Gasteroenterology, (2013), Article ID 935295).
      HBsAg quantification is a significant biomarker for prognosis and treatment response in chronic hepatitis B. However the achievement of HBsAg loss and seroconversion is rarely observed in chronically infected patients but remains one of the ultimate goals of therapy. Current therapy such as Nucleos(t)ide analogues are molecules that inhibit HBV DNA synthesis but are not directed at reducing HBsAg level. Nucleos(t)ide analogs, even with prolonged therapy, only show weak HBsAg clearance comparable to those observed naturally (between −1%-2%) (Janssen, Lancet, (2005), 365, 123-9; Marcellin, N. Engl. J. Med., (2004), 351, 1206-17; Buster, Hepatology, (2007), 46, 388-94).
      Hepatitis B e-antigen (also called HBV envelope antigen or HBeAg) is a viral protein that is secreted by hepatitis B infected cells. HBeAg is associated with chronic hepatitis B infections and is used as a marker of active viral disease and a patient's degree of infectiousness.
      The function of the hepatitis B virus precore or HBeAg is not completely known. However HBeAg is well known to play a key role in viral persistence. HBeAg is thought to promote HBV chronicity by functioning as an immunoregulatory protein. In particular, the HBeAg is a secreted accessory protein, which appears to attenuate the host immune response to the intracellular nucleocapsid protein (Walsh, Virology, 2011, 411(1):132-141). The HBeAg acts as an immune tolerogen contributing to HBV persistence, and possibly functions in utero considering that soluble HBeAg traverses the placenta (Walsh, Virology, 2011, 411(1):132-141). Furthermore, HBeAg downregulates: i) cellular genes controlling intracellular signaling; and ii) the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) to dampen the innate immune response to viral infection (Walsh, Virology, 2011, 411(1):132-141). In the absence of HBeAg, HBV replication is associated with upregulation of the TLR2 pathway (Walsh, Virology, 2011, 411(1):132-141). Accordingly, HBeAg has a significant role in modulating virus/host interactions to influence the host immune response (Walsh, Virology, 2011, 411(1):132-141). Thus, reducing HBeAg in HBeAg positive patient population may lead to reversal of HBV specific immunedysfunction (Milich, 1997, J. Viral. Hep. 4: 48-59; Milich, 1998, J. Immunol. 160: 2013-2021). In addition, the secreted HBeAg is significantly more efficient than the intracellular hepatitis core antigen (HBcAg) at eliciting T-cell tolerance, and the split T-cell tolerance between the HBeAg and the HBcAg and the clonal heterogeneity of HBc/HBeAg-specific T-cell tolerance may have significant implications for natural HBV infection and especially for precore-negative chronic hepatitis (Chen, 2005, Journal of Virology, 79: 3016-3027).
      Accordingly, reducing secretion of HBeAg in addition to secretion of HBsAg would lead to an improved inhibition of development of a chronic HBV infection as compared to the inhibition of secretion of HBsAg alone. In addition, the highest rates of transmission of an acute infection to chronic (>80%) have been reported in cases of matemo-fetal and neonatal HBV transmission from HBeAg-positive mothers (Liaw, Lancet, 2009, 373: 582-592; Liaw, Dig. Dis. Sci., 2010, 55: 2727-2734; and Hadziyannis, 2011, Joumal of hepatology, 55: 183-191). Therefore, reducing HBeAg in an expected mother may not only reduce the patient's degree of infectiousness, but may also inhibit the development of a chronic HBV infection of her child.
      Therefore, in the therapy of HBV there is an unmet medical need to inhibit viral expression, particularly to inhibit secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg (Wieland, S. F. & F. V. Chisari. J Virol, (2005), 79, 9369-80; Kumar et al. J Virol, (2011), 85, 987-95; Woltman et al. PLoS One, (2011), 6, e15324; Op den Brouw et al. Immunology, (2009b), 126, 280-9).
      WO 03/022987 discloses for example in Table 7A 1298 genes that are upregulated in hepatitis C-positive tissue. One of the mentioned genes is topoisomerase-related function protein 4 (TRF4, AF089897). AF089897 is also called TRF4-2, which is quite similar to position 880 to 2340 of SEQ ID NO: 4 herein. The observation that a fragment of PAPD5 is upregulated slightly in hepatitis C positive cells does not provide any indication that inhibiting PAPD5 represents an effective therapy. WO 03/022987A2 does not disclose any hint that fragments of PAPD5 plays any critical role during hepatitis C infection at all. In addition, HCV and HBV are two completely different viruses leading to two completely different diseases with different etiologies, different progression and different medication. This is in line with the observation of the present inventors that the PAPD5 and PAPD7 inhibitors DHQ and THP are inactive against hepatitis C virus (HCV) or other viruses beside HBV (data not shown).
      In WO 2010/040571 PAPD5 has been suggested in a long list of other genes as having a potential role in cell proliferation in metabolic and tumorous disease without the provision of any actual evidence.
      In WO 2013/166264 PAPD5 has been suggested in a long list of other genes as having a potential role in increasing viral replication without the provision of any actual evidence.
      In WO 2017/066712 down regulation of PAPD5 in relation to the treatment and diagnosis of telomere diseases has been described. Five shRNA structures for this purpose have been described.
      To our knowledge the expression of PAPD5 or PAPD7 has never been associated with HBV infection, nor has modified single stranded antisense oligonucleotides been made against these targets.
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION
      Thus, the technical problem underlying the present invention is the identification and provision of ameliorated means and methods for treating and/or preventing a HBV infection.
      The technical problem is solved by the provision of the embodiments described herein and characterized in the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002747291,"BACKGROUND ART
      Porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH) is a gonadotropin secreted by the porcine anterior pituitary, and which is formed by an α subunit and a β subunit that are non-covalently linked; wherein, the α subunit is highly conserved and identical to the α subunit of Porcine Luteinizing Hormone (pLH) and Porcine Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (pTSH); and the β subunit differs, which mainly determines the functional specificity of FSH. pFSH can promote the growth and maturation of sow endometrium, ovary and follicles; promote the synthesis and secretion of estrogen; and induce the development of boar seminiferous tubules and maintain spermatogenesis. pFSH is commonly used in the field of animal breeding for the synchronization of estrus, superovulation, embryo transplantation, and treatment of ovarian diseases in female animals. Studies show that the effect of porcine FSH for superovulation of cattle and sheep is better than that of FSH of cattle and sheep, and thus, pFSH is of great value in livestock production and economic animal breeding.
      At present, related patents and articles report the expression of FSH fusion proteins, but most of them are related to the recombinant expression and application of a human FSH. The use of the human FSH in the field of animal breeding has also achieved some success. However, although humans and domestic animals belong to mammals, there are still large species differences in protein sequences (the human FSH and porcine FSH have a homology of 73% in term of the amino acid sequence of the α subunit, a homology of 93% in term of β subunit, and a homology of 73% in term of Fc fragment). If the human recombinant FSH is used in animals for a long time, the animal's immune system will recognize the human recombinant FSH and induce the production of antibodies (including neutralizing antibodies), which specifically bind to the receptor binding site of the animal FSH, thereby blocking the biological activity of the drug, and resulting in the lower and lower bioavailability of the human FSH in animals, which limits the application of the human FSH in animals, especially in economic animals such as pig, cattle and sheep that need to use FSH for a long time. This is one of the reasons why the currently marketed human recombinant FSH is not used in the field of animal breeding.
      Currently, commercial FSH products on the market mainly include FSH extracted from porcine pituitary and pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Porcine pituitary FSH, such as Folltropin-V (Canada), has a short half-life (5 hours) and requires frequent administration, resulting in high cost of feeding and management for terminal customers. Furthermore, it is difficult to separate porcine FSH from LH when purified from porcine pituitary tissue, and the difficult purification and the low productivity greatly limit the practical applications of porcine FSH. PMSG is a glycoprotein hormone secreted by the chorioallantoic membrane cells of the placenta of an animal of genus Equus, has both FSH (high) and LH (low) activities, and has the effect of promoting the reproductive function of ovaries and testes of animals. In the field of animal breeding, PMSG is often used for inducing synchronization of estrus and superovulation of female animals, and treating reproductive disorders and ovarian insufficiency in female animals; promoting the development of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis in male animals. However, since PMSG molecules contain a relatively high amount of hexose and sialic acid, and have a long half-life in animals (120 h), when used in animals for superovulation, it is easy to cause various adverse effects in dams, such as ovarian cysts, early degradation of the embryo at the beginning of pregnancy. Furthermore, commercial PMSG is extracted and purified from the serum of pregnant horses; when used in other animals, antibodies will be produced, and PMSG has certain immunogenicity and cannot be used for a long time. In addition, PMSG is prepared by collecting serum from pregnant horses and this often causes abortion of pregnant horses and death of fetal horses due to excessive blood collection, which is inconformity with animal ethics.
      Therefore, on the basis that human FSH is not suitable for animals, porcine pituitary FSH requires frequent administration, and PMSG is prone to cause adverse effects, there is a need for a long-acting animal-source FSH in the breeding field of animals, especially economic animals.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The purpose of the present invention is to provide a novel long-acting recombinant porcine FSH fusion protein and a preparation method and application thereof.
      The concept of the present invention is as follows: Fc fusion protein technology is one of the most widely used and stable technologies in the development of long-acting protein drugs, and FSH is fused with Fc by genetic engineering technology to produce a novel recombinant protein FSH-Fc. Not only the high biological activity of FSH can be retained, but also a longer half-life can be obtained. At the same time, the obtained recombinant protein has high purity, relatively uniform quality, no LH and high safety factor. The use of mammalian expression systems, especially Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) for the expression of recombinant proteins, provides protein molecules that are closest to nature molecules in terms of molecular structure, physicochemical properties, and biological functions.
      For the purposes of the present invention, the long-acting recombinant porcine FSH fusion proteins of the present invention comprise fusion proteins pFSH-Fc-1 and pFSH-Fc-2, wherein α subunit of the porcine FSH fusion protein pFSH-Fc-1 is directly or indirectly fused with the Fc fragment by means of a linking component, and β subunit of the porcine FSH fusion protein pFSH-Fc-1 binds with the α subunit by means of a Van der Waals force or a linking component; and β subunit of the porcine FSH fusion protein pFSH-Fc-2 is directly or indirectly fused with the Fc fragment by means of a linking component, and α subunit of the porcine FSH fusion protein pFSH-Fc-2 binds with the β subunit by means of a Van der Waals force or a linking component.

      The amino acid sequence of the pFSHα is represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, or the pFSHα is composed of an amino acid sequence having a homology of 90% or more with SEQ ID NO: 1 and an activity equivalent to that of SEQ ID NO: 1.
      The amino acid sequence of the pFSHβ is represented by SEQ ID NO: 3, or the pFSHβ is composed of an amino acid sequence having a homology of 90% or more with SEQ ID NO: 3 and an activity equivalent to that of SEQ ID NO: 3.
      The Fc comprises a hinge region as well as CH2 and CH3 regions of an immunoglobulin.

      The Fc mutant refers to a Fc variant comprising amino acid mutation at one or more sites in the Fc fragment, and includes a human IgG2 Fc variant comprising a human IgG2 hinge region, a CH2 region and a CH3 region, with a mutation Pro331Ser.
      Preferably, the Fc is derived from a porcine immunoglobulin, i.e., pFc, and comprises the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 regions of the porcine immunoglobulin. The amino acid sequence of the pFc is represented by SEQ ID NO: 5, or the pFc is composed of an amino acid sequence having a homology of 80% or more with SEQ ID NO: 5 and an activity equivalent to that of SEQ ID NO: 5.
      The pFSHα or pFSHβ subunit is linked to the Fc directly or by a linker, preferably by a linker.
      Wherein, the linker is a flexible polypeptide consisting of 2 to 20 flexible amino acid selected from at least one of Gly, Ser, Ala and Thr;
      Preferably, the linker is (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) n (SEQ ID NO: 10), wherein n is an integer between 2 and 5, more preferably n is 3.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002690848,"BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
      Tau is a phosphoprotein having a physiological function of binding to tubulin to stabilise microtubules. The degree of tau phosphorylation determines the binding affinity to microtubules-tau hyperphosphorylation leads to weaker microtubule binding. There is growing evidence that tau malfunction is implicated in, or triggers neurodegeneration and dementia. There is therefore significant interest in the molecular imaging of tau in vivo.

wherein
      R 4 and R 5 are each independently H, a lower alkyl group, or a cycloalkyl group, or R 4, R 5, and the nitrogen atom to which they are attached are together form a 3- to 8-membered nitrogen-containing aliphatic ring (one or more carbon atoms constituting said nitrogen-containing aliphatic ring may be replaced by a N, S or O atom, and when the carbon atom is replaced by a N atom, said N atom may be substituted with a lower alkyl group), or

(MOL) (CDX)
Okamura et al use a manual radiolabelling reaction, plus semi-preparative HPLC for purification of the radiotracer.

      [ 18F]-FMISO, which also incorporates a fluorohydroxypropyl group, can be prepared via an automated radiosynthesis. Blom et al studied various solid-phase extraction (SPE) columns together with the chemical and radiochemical impurities, and concluded that a hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced (HLB), polymer-based cartridge was superior to both a mixed mode (MCX) cartridge and a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge.
      There is therefore still a need for alternative and/or improved methods of preparing and purifying the tau imaging agents of WO 2012/057312 A1 and Okamura et al.
The Present Invention
      The precursor synthesis method of the present invention provides an automated synthesis of quinoline-based [ 18F]-labelled tau radiotracers. The automated method includes an automated purification methodology, which uses only solid-phase extraction (SPE) avoids the need for HPLC as taught by the prior art. The purification method is thus fast (ensuring minimal loss of tracer due to radioactive decay), and reproducible. The purification method has also been adapted to work effectively across the wide range of operating temperatures (ca. 15-37° C.) that may be found in practice in hot cells where radiosynthesizer apparatus is located.
      The method comprises the use of an interchangeable, single-use cassette which is adapted to make the radiosynthesis even more convenient for the operator, since minimal operator intervention is required. The cassette approach also has the advantages of: simplified set-up hence reduced risk of operator error; improved GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliance; multi-tracer capability; rapid change between production runs; pre-run automated diagnostic checking of the cassette and reagents; automated barcode cross-check of chemical reagents vs the synthesis to be carried out; reagent traceability; single-use and hence no risk of cross-contamination, as well as being tamper and abuse resistance.

R1 and R2 independently comprise H or C1-4 alkyl, or R1 and R2 together with the N atom and optionally the phenyl ring to which they are attached comprise a 5- or 6-membered nitrogen-containing aliphatic or heteroaromatic ring, optionally incorporating one further heteroatom chosen from —O—, —S—, ═N— and —NRa—, where Ra is H or C1-4 alkyl;
R3 is C1-4 alkyl, C1-4 haloalkyl, C5-8 aryl or C6-12 aralkyl;
Pg1 is an alcohol protecting group;
provided that in Formula (I), one Xb group is present, and in Formula (II), one Xc group is present.
R1 and R2 independently comprise H or C1-4 alkyl, or R1 and R2 together with the N atom and optionally the phenyl ring to which they are attached comprise a 5- or 6-membered nitrogen-containing aliphatic or heteroaromatic ring, optionally incorporating one further heteroatom chosen from —O—, —S—, ═N— and —NRa—, where Ra is H or C1-4 alkyl;

      Thus, in the method of the first aspect, the X b group of the precursor of Formula (I) contains a reactive site (sulfonate ester group), which undergoes nucleophilic radiofluorination with [ 18F]-fluoride ion in step (ii) to give the corresponding X c substituent of the radiotracer product of Formula (II). The microprocessor control of step (ii) is achieved via the microprocessor of said automated synthesizer apparatus. The provisos of one X b or X c group being present imply that:
      in Formula (I), one of X 1 and X 2 is an X a group and the other is an X b group;
      in Formula (II), one of X 1 and X 3 is an X a group and the other is an X c group;
      The term “radiotracer” has its' conventional meaning and refers to a radiopharmaceutical used to trace a physiological or biological process without affecting it. The term “radiopharmaceutical” has its' conventional meaning and refers to a radiolabelled compound administered to the mammalian body in vivo for the purpose of imaging or therapy.
      By the term “automated synthesizer” is meant an automated module based on the principle of unit operations as described by Satyamurthy et al [Clin. Positr. Imag., 2(5), 233-253 (1999)]. The term ‘unit operations’ means that complex processes are reduced to a series of simple operations or reactions, which can be applied to a range of materials. Such automated synthesizers are preferred for the method of the present invention especially when a radiopharmaceutical composition is desired. They are commercially available from a range of suppliers [Satyamurthy et al, above], including: GE Healthcare; CTI Inc; Ion Beam Applications S.A. (Chemin du Cyclotron 3, B-1348 Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium); Raytest (Germany) and Bioscan (USA).
      Commercial automated synthesizers also provide suitable containers for the liquid radioactive waste generated as a result of the radiopharmaceutical preparation. Automated synthesizers are not typically provided with radiation shielding, since they are designed to be employed in a suitably configured radioactive work cell. The radioactive work cell provides suitable radiation shielding to protect the operator from potential radiation dose, as well as ventilation to remove chemical and/or radioactive vapours. The automated synthesizer preferably comprises a cassette. The automated synthesizer comprises a microprocessor, which controls the operation of the synthesizer apparatus, including the operation of any associated cassette.
      By the term “cassette” is meant a unit piece of apparatus designed such that the whole unit fits removably and interchangeably onto an automated synthesizer apparatus (as defined above), in such a way that mechanical movement of moving parts of the synthesizer controls the operation of the cassette from outside the cassette, i.e. externally. Suitable cassettes comprise a linear array of valves, each linked to a port where reagents or vials can be attached, by either needle puncture of an inverted septum-sealed vial, or by gas-tight, marrying joints. Each valve has a male-female joint which interfaces with a corresponding moving arm of the automated synthesizer. External rotation of the arm thus controls the opening or closing of the valve when the cassette is attached to the automated synthesizer. Additional moving parts of the automated synthesizer are designed to clip onto syringe plunger tips, and thus raise or depress syringe barrels.
      The cassette is versatile, typically having several positions where reagents can be attached, and several suitable for attachment of syringe vials of reagents or chromatography cartridges (e.g. solid phase extraction or SPE). The cassette always comprises a reaction vessel. Such reaction vessels are preferably 1 to 10 cm 3, most preferably 2 to 5 cm 3 in volume and are configured such that 3 or more ports of the cassette are connected thereto, to permit transfer of reagents or solvents from various ports on the cassette. Preferably the cassette has 15 to 40 valves in a linear array, most preferably 20 to 30, with 25 being especially preferred. The valves of the cassette are preferably each identical, and most preferably are 3-way valves. The cassettes are designed to be suitable for radiopharmaceutical manufacture and are therefore manufactured from materials which are of pharmaceutical grade and ideally also are resistant to radiolysis.
      Preferred automated synthesizers of the present invention comprise a disposable or single-use cassette which comprises all the reagents, reaction vessels and apparatus necessary to carry out the preparation of a given batch of radiofluorinated radiopharmaceutical. The cassette means that the automated synthesizer has the flexibility to be capable of making a variety of different radiopharmaceuticals with minimal risk of cross-contamination, by simply changing the cassette. The cassette approach also has the advantages of simplified set-up hence reduced risk of operator error; improved GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliance; multi-tracer capability; rapid change between production runs; pre-run automated diagnostic checking of the cassette and reagents; automated barcode cross-check of chemical reagents vs the synthesis to be carried out; reagent traceability; single-use and hence no risk of cross-contamination, as well as being tamper and abuse resistance.
      By the term “precursor” refers to a ‘radiolabelling precursor’ which means a non-radioactive compound suitable for reaction with a supply of a radioisotope in a suitable solvent, to give the radiolabeled compound of interest in the minimum numbers of steps. Thus, the precursor is designed such that the chemical and radioactive yield is optimised, and the number of steps involving the handling of radioactivity is minimized. The precursor is particularly suitable for radiolabelling with 18F.
      By the term “protecting group” is meant a removable group which inhibits or suppresses undesirable chemical reactions, and which is designed such that it can be both attached and removed to/from the functional group in question under mild enough conditions that do not modify or compromise the rest of the molecule. After deprotection the desired product is obtained. The use of protecting groups is described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, Theorodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts, [Wiley Blackwell, (2006)]. The term “deprotection” has its conventional meaning in the field of chemistry and/or radiochemistry, i.e. the removal of a protecting group.
      The alcohol protecting group (Pg 1) of the first aspect protects the secondary alcohol group of the X b group. Suitable Pg 1 groups include ethers (alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, or silyl); esters or carbonates. Further details of alcohol protecting groups are provided by Greene and Wuts (cited above).
      When R 1 and R 2 together with the N atom and optionally the phenyl ring to which they are attached comprise a 5- or 6-membered nitrogen-containing aliphatic or heteroaromatic ring, that means that the 5- or 6-membered ring incorporating one or more of N, R 1 and R 2 may either be a substituent on the phenyl ring, or be fused with the phenyl ring bearing —NR 1R 2. Examples of the former would be piperidine or morpholine rings singly bonded to the phenyl ring. A preferred example of a fused ring is when X a is:
      
(MOL) (CDX)
The X b group incorporates a sulfonate ester group —OSO 2R 3. Such sulfonate esters are important leaving groups in nucleophilic substitution, and the reactivity of the sulfonate ester towards nucleophilic substitution can be adjusted depending on the choice of R 3 [M. B. Smith and J. March, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fifth Edition, John Wiley & Sons Inc., (2001), pages 445-449].
      The “suitable solvent” for step (ii), includes: acetonitrile, a C 1-4 alkyl alcohol, dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, or dimethylsulfoxide, or aqueous mixtures of any thereof.
Preferred Aspects
      In the method of the first aspect, step (ii) is preferably carried out by:

and the radiotracer product is the S-enantiomer of Formula (IIB):
      
(MOL) (CDX)
The precursor may be enriched in said S-enantiomeric form, to exceed the 50:50 content of the racemic mixture, and is preferably in substantially pure form. In the method of the first aspect, A in Formulae (I), (IA), (IB), (II), (IIA), (IIB) and (III) is preferably an A 2 group of formula:
      
(MOL) (CDX)
wherein —NR 1R 2 is more preferably —NHCH 3 or —N(CH 3) 2, and most preferably —NHCH 3.
      In the method of the first aspect, Pg 1 is preferably a Pg 1a group, wherein Pg 1a comprises:
(i) —Rc;
(ii) —Ar1;
(iii) —CH(Ar1)2;
(iv) —C(Ar1)3;
(v) tetrahydropyranyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents chosen from Hal and OCH3;
(vi) —CH2ORb;
(vii) —SiRd3;
(viii) —(C═O)Rd;
(ix) —(C═O)ORe wherein Re is H, Rd, C1-4 haloalkyl or vinyl; or
(x) —(C═O)NHRd;
wherein:
each Rb is independently Rd or C2-4 alkoxyalkyl optionally substituted with one or more Hal;
each Rc is independently C1-4 alkyl;
each Rd is independently Rc or Ar1; and
Ar1 is independently benzyl or phenyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents chosen from Hal, CH3, OCH3, NO2 or —N(CH3)2.
Pg1 is most preferably tetrahydropyranyl.
(i) —Rc;
(ii) —Ar1;
(iii) —CH(Ar1)2;
(iv) —C(Ar1)3;
(v) tetrahydropyranyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents chosen from Hal and OCH3;
(vi) —CH2ORb;
(vii) —SiRd3;
(viii) —(C═O)Rd;
(ix) —(C═O)ORe wherein Re is H, Rd, C1-4 haloalkyl or vinyl; or
(x) —(C═O)NHRd;
wherein:
each Rb is independently Rd or C2-4 alkoxyalkyl optionally substituted with one or more Hal;
each Rc is independently C1-4 alkyl;
each Rd is independently Rc or Ar1; and
Ar1 is independently benzyl or phenyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents chosen from Hal, CH3, OCH3, NO2 or —N(CH3)2.

      In the method of the first aspect, R 3 is preferably chosen from: —CH 3, —CF 3, —C 4F 9, —CH 2CF 3, —C 6H 4—CH 3, —C 6H 4—NO 2 or —C 6H 4—Br. R 3 is more preferably —C 6H 4—CH 3.
      In the method of the first aspect, the cassette preferably further comprises one to three C18-reverse phase solid phase extraction (SPE) columns, and said method further comprises step (iii):
(iii) microprocessor-controlled SPE purification of the 18F-labelled radiotracer of Formula (II) from step (ii) using said cassette SPE columns, and the solvent(s) of said cassette.
(iii) microprocessor-controlled SPE purification of the 18F-labelled radiotracer of Formula (II) from step (ii) using said cassette SPE columns, and the solvent(s) of said cassette.
      The use of SPE avoids the need for HPLC purification, which is typically carried out manually, and thus means that the radiosynthesis and purification of the radiotracer can be carried out in a fully-automated manner using an appropriate cassette. Thus, the purification method of the present invention preferably does not comprise HPLC. In the SPE purification of the first aspect, the C18-reverse phase SPE column is preferably silica-based, and is thus preferably a C18-silica SPE column and is more preferably a tC18+ silica SPE column Polymer-based SPE cartridges are less preferred, since HLB type cartridges have been found to bind the radiotracers of the present invention so strongly that elution becomes difficult. Reverse phase SPE cartridges suitable for use in the present invention can be obtained from Waters Limited (730-740 Centennial Court, Centennial Park, Elstree, Hertfordshire, UK). A suitable size of SPE column for use in the present invention is 900 mg.
      It is well-established that chromatography such as the SPE purification process is subject to variations depending on the ambient temperature. So-called “hot cells” are used for the production of PET radiotracers. These are enclosures with the necessary facilities to carry out the radiosynthesis, but also having radiation-shielding and suitable ventilation to protect the operator. Such hot cells range from large units that are able to maintain room temperature (18° C.-22° C.) despite the large amount of electrical equipment contained within them, to very small units that can reach operating temperatures of 30° C.-40° C. The present inventors have found that (see Example 2), elevated temperatures affect the SPE purification such that the radiotracer product elutes more quickly. As a result, satisfactory purification of the radiotracer of Formula (II) can be achieved at temperatures ranges of 15-25° C. using two 900 mg size SPE columns. At higher temperatures, however, of 15 to 40° C. three SPE columns are necessary. Hence, the cassette and SPE method of the first aspect preferably comprises the use of three 900 mg size SPE columns, since that permits effective purification across the range of operating temperatures (ca. 15 to 40° C.) likely to be found in radiosynthesis hot cells. Whilst it is possible that a smaller number of larger SPE columns could be used, such larger columns are less likely to be of a size compatible with automated synthesizer apparatus.
      In the SPE purification of the first aspect, the C18-reverse phase SPE column is eluted with an elution volume in the range 9-12 mL, preferably 10.5 to 11.5 mL. In the SPE purification method of the first aspect, the SPE columns are first eluted with an aqueous, water-miscible organic solvent to remove impurities, and then eluted with ethanol to elute the radiotracer of Formula (II). The “aqueous, water-miscible organic solvent” refers to a mixture of water and the water-miscible organic solvent. Suitable such organic solvents include acetonitrile, ethanol, THF, isopropanol and methanol, and are preferably chosen from: acetonitrile, ethanol and THF, more preferably acetonitrile and ethanol, most preferably acetonitrile. The aqueous acetonitrile solvent, i.e. the acetonitrile/water solvent mixture is suitably in the range 20 to 50% v/v, and is preferably in the range 25 to 45%, more preferably in the range 35 to 40%. 40% aqueous acetonitrile is most preferred.
      By way of illustration of the SPE purification, the following discussion refers to Compound 1 and Precursor 1 (see Scheme 1)—but the same principles apply for other compounds within the scope of the first aspect.
      
(MOL) (CDX)
      Under the reaction conditions, there is a significant chemical excess of Precursor 1 over the chemical amount of [ 18F]-fluoride present. Under the reaction conditions, Precursor 1 also reacts and at least a portion thereof is converted primarily to the diol (Impurity A; see structures below), and possibly some of Impurity B. The largest impurity is Impurity A, which elutes and is removed when the SPE columns are eluted with aqueous acetonitrile.
      Precursor 1 is significantly more lipophilic than Compound 1, and remains bound to SPE columns—when eluted with either aqueous acetonitrile or ethanol. Compound 1 does not elute when the SPE columns are washed with 10-12 mL of aqueous acetonitrile, but is subsequently eluted when pure ethanol is used to elute the SPE column(s). In this manner, Compound 1 is purified. Impurity B is observed less frequently, but any present remains bound to the SPE column under the conditions of the invention.
      The method of the first aspect preferably further comprises, in addition to purification step (iii), the following steps:
(iv) optionally diluting the purified [18F]-radiotracer of Formula (II) from step (iii) with a biocompatible carrier;
(v) aseptic filtration of the optionally diluted solution from step (iv) to give a radiopharmaceutical composition comprising said radiotracer.
      The “biocompatible carrier” is a fluid, especially a liquid, in which the radioconjugate can be suspended or preferably dissolved, such that the composition is physiologically tolerable, i.e. can be administered to the mammalian body without toxicity or undue discomfort. The biocompatible carrier is suitably an injectable carrier liquid such as sterile, pyrogen-free water for injection; an aqueous solution such as saline (which may advantageously be balanced so that the final product for injection is isotonic); an aqueous buffer solution comprising a biocompatible buffering agent (e.g. phosphate buffer); an aqueous solution of one or more tonicity-adjusting substances (e.g. salts of plasma cations with biocompatible counterions), sugars (e.g. glucose or sucrose), sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitol or mannitol), glycols (e.g. glycerol), or other non-ionic polyol materials (e.g. polyethyleneglycols, propylene glycols and the like). Preferably the biocompatible carrier is pyrogen-free water for injection, isotonic saline or phosphate buffer.
      The “radiopharmaceutical composition” is a pharmaceutical composition comprising said radiotracer. Such compositions have their conventional meaning, and in particular are in a form suitable for mammalian administration, especially via parenteral injection. By the phrase “in a form suitable for mammalian administration” is meant a composition which is sterile, pyrogen-free, lacks compounds which produce toxic or adverse effects, and is formulated at a biocompatible pH (approximately pH 4.0 to 10.5). Such compositions lack particulates which could risk causing emboli in vivo, and are formulated so that precipitation does not occur on contact with biological fluids (e.g. blood). Such compositions also contain only biologically compatible excipients, and are preferably isotonic.
      The production of [ 18F]-fluoride suitable for radiopharmaceutical applications is well-known in the art, and has been reviewed by Hjelstuen et al [Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm., 78(3), 307-313 (2011)], and Jacobson et al [Curr. Top. Med. Chem., 10(11), 1048-1059 (2010)].
      A non-automated radiosynthesis of Compound 1 has been reported by Okamura et al [J. Nucl. Med., 54(8), 1420-1427 (2013)].
      Substituted quinolones of Formula (I) can be synthesized by conventional quinoline syntheses [Kouznetsov et al, Curr. Org. Chem., 9, 141-161 (2005)]. The syntheses of several 2-arylquinolines has been provided by Tago et al [J. Lab. Comp. Radiopharm., 57(1), 18-24 (2014)]. Further details of the precursor syntheses are provided in WO 2012/057312 A1. Thus, WO 2012/057312 A1 discloses the following synthesis of the 18F labelling precursors having alkoxy substituents at the 6-position functionalised with hydroxy and 18F groups:

The corresponding enantiomers can be obtained by adapting the synthesis using chiral starting materials, or resolution of the racemic mixture using e.g. chiral chromatography or crystallisation of a chiral salt as is known in the art.
      In a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of purification of the 18F-labelled radiotracer of Formula (II), (IIA) or (IIB) as defined in the first aspect, which comprises the SPE purification method as described in a preferred embodiment of the first aspect.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002685732,"BACKGROUND ART
      Generally, an inflammatory response is a normal response of human body associated with an edema, a pain etc in case that a tissue or a cell received any invasion causing some organic change in the tissue or cell. Recently, various kinds of cytokines have been found to be involved in the inflammatory disease.
      Allergic reaction may be classified into four categories, i.e., type I, II, III and IV according to the types of response or two categories, i.e., immediate type allergic reaction such as type I, II or III, and delayed type allergic reaction such as type IV according to the types of the period from the re-sensitization time caused by allergen to the onset time of reaction.
      Among them, type I allergy, being involved in IgE antibody and called as anaphylaxis type allergy, causes to a bronchial asthma, atopic diseases such as dermatitis or gastroenteritis etc, allergic rhinitis such as pollenosis, allergic conjunctivitis, food allergy and the like.
      Asthma is regarded as a complex syndrome of the airways that is characterized by various clinical symptoms, for example, cough, dyspnea caused by airflow obstruction, acute or chronic airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and structural remodeling and can be reversibly or irreversibly recoverable. Most of asthma is allergic disease and is characterized by chronic airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Minoguchi K and Adachi M., Pathophysiology of asthma. In: Cherniack N S, Altose M D, Homma I. editors, Rehabilitation of the patient with respiratory disease, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1999, pp 97-104).
      The asthma can be classified two types, i.e., extrinsic asthma and intrinsic asthma. The extrinsic asthma is caused by exposing antigen and it is shown positive reaction in skin test or bronchial provocation test against the antigen. Usually causing ages is getting younger. It is mainly caused by House Dust Mite Dermatophagoides and pollen, epithelium of animal, fungi and so on. The intrinsic asthma is caused by upper respiratory infections, exercise, emotional instability, changing of climate of humidity and it is common to adult patient. Also, the IgE antigen of extrinsic asthma can be detected by skin test due to increasing IgE in serum.
      With regards to pathophysiology, asthma is recognized by T-helper2 (Th2)-cell-driven chronic inflammation, and a variety of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines, signaling molecules, adhesion molecules and growth factors, from immune cells and structural cells in the airways are involved in various stages of asthma (Elias J A et al., J Clin Invest. 2003, 111, 291-297). The activated inflammatory cells such as eosinophil, mast cells, alveolar macrophage etc in the bronchus of patients suffering from asthma, release various inflammatory mediators such as cystein leukotrienes, prostaglandins etc and is involved in potent bronchial constriction (Maggi E. et al., Immunotechnology 1998, 3, 233-244; Pawankar R. et al., Curr: Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001, 1, 3-6; Barnes P J et al., Phamacol. Rev. 1998, 50, 515-596).
      Accordingly, since the reproduction of various cytokines involved in inflammatory cell activation, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 etc and IgE and reproduction of cystein leukotrienes released from the inflammatory cells are the main causes of inflammation, allergic reaction and asthma, there have been much studied to develop the inhibiting agents from the reproduction of those till now.
      Generally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of pulmonary disease caused by abnormal inflammatory disease in lung resulting in the obstruction of respiratory tract. COPD gives rise to dyspnoea resulting from the hindrance from exhausting air flow and shows different characteristics for example, the poor reversibility of an airways limitation or airways obstruction, the progressive development according to elapse time etc, from the common characteristics of asthma and may be classified into a pulmonary emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis (Barnes P. J., Pharmacol. Rev. 2004, 56, 515-548).
      COPD has been reported as one of risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and the fifth leading cause of death worldwide in 2001. The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease based on Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria (a ratio of FEV1 to FVC of less than 0.7) was 17.2% (men, 25.8%; women, 9.6%) among Koreans older than 45 years (Kim, D. S. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2005, 172, 842-847; Sin, D. D. et al., Proc. Am. Thorac. Soc. 2005, 2, 8-11; Buist A. S. et al., Lancet, 2007, 370, 741-750)
      Most patients with COPD have all three pathological mechanisms (chronic obstructive bronchitis, emphysema, and mucus plugging) as all are induced by smoking, but they may differ in the proportion of emphysema and obstructive bronchitis. In developed countries, cigarette smoking is by far the most common cause of COPD, but there are several other risk factors, including air pollution (particularly, indoor air pollution from burning fuels), poor diet, and occupational exposure. COPD is characterized by acceleration in the normal decline of lung function seen with age. The slowly progressive airflow limitation leads to disability and premature death and is quite different from the variable airway obstruction and symptoms in asthma, which rarely progresses in severity.
      There have been reported that the pathophysiological action and syndrome of COPD are fundamentally different from those of asthma. Although COPD and asthma both involve inflammation in the respiratory tract, there are marked differences in the nature of the inflammatory process, with differences in inflammatory cells, mediators, response to inflammation, anatomical distribution, and response to anti-inflammatory therapy, for example, (a) in respect to inflammatory cells, mast cell, eosinophils, D4 + cell (Th2), macrophages etc mainly act on the occurrence of asthma whereas neutrophils, CD8 + (Tc) etc mainly act on the occurrence of COPD; (b) in respect to inflammatory mediators, leukotriens B, histamine, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin, RENTES, oxidative stress etc are mainly involved in the occurrence of asthma whereas TNF-alpha, IL-8, GRO-alpha etc are mainly involved in the occurrence of COPD; (c) in respect to inflammatory syndrome, asthma shows different inflammatory syndrome by acting on the overall pulmonary tract at early age, such as AHR (airway hyperresponsiveness), epithelial shedding, fibrosis, no parenchymal involvement, mucus secretion, relatively reversible airways obstruction, cough, sneezing, dyspnea etc from that of COPD, which occurs by acting on peripheral airways at adults and shows various phenomena such as, epithelial metaplasia, parenchymal destruction, relatively irreversible airways obstruction, chronic bronchitis, emphysema etc (Barnes P J., Chest 2000, 117, 10S-14S; Saetta M. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001, 163, 1304-1309).
      Histopathological studies on COPD show a predominant involvement of peripheral airways (bronchioles) and lung parenchyma, whereas asthma involves inflammation in all airways but without involvement of the lung parenchyma. There is obstruction of bronchioles, with fibrosis and infiltration with macrophages and T lymphocytes. There is destruction of lung parenchyma, as well as an increased number of macrophages and CD8 (cytotoxic) T lymphocytes (Saetta M. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998, 157, 822-826). Bronchial biopsies show similar changes with an infiltration of macrophages and CD8 cells and an increased number of neutrophils in patients with severe COPD (Di Stefano A. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998, 158, 1277-1285).
      In contrast to asthma, eosinophils are not prominent except during exacerbations or when patients have concomitant asthma (Fabbri L. et al., Thorax 1998, 53, 803-808; Fabbri L M. et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003, 167, 418-424).
      Accordingly, the therapeutic approach of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) shall be different from that of asthma; however, the present therapy has been focused on treating non-specifically both of diseases. Therefore, there have been no anti-inflammatory therapies specifically approved for COPD and the available anti-inflammatory therapies were originally developed for asthma. The challenges facing research in COPD are multi-faceted; the mechanisms underlying the complex and heterogeneous pathology of this disease require unraveling; the role of inflammation in disease progression needs to be confirmed. (Hele D. et al., Expert. Opino. Invest. Drug, 2003, 12, 5-18; Fox, J C. et al., Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009, 9, 231-242).
      Improvements to the current therapy available to treat asthma in the form of longer acting beta-agonists, safer steroids and combination therapies are ongoing and for COPD anti-cholinergics provide symptomatic relief. Steroids have been used to treat exacerbations, but as yet, no treatment has been shown to impact significantly on the progressive decline in lung function in COPD or the development of asthma.
      Accordingly, there have been much studied to develop new drugs with potential to successfully and specifically treat allergic disease, inflammatory disease, asthma or COPD till now.
      The present inventors have been focused to develop potent treating agent derived from natural resources with safety and efficacy such as plant, animals etc having potent treating activity of allergic disease, inflammatory disease, asthma or COPD and finally, have subsequently found unexpectedly surprising results, for example, potent anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy and anti-asthma activity of the extract of Pseudolysimachion longifolium (Korean Patent No. 10-860080 B1 and US 2012/0183632 A1) and various compounds isolated therefrom such as, verproside (6-O-3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl catalpol), picroside II (6-O-4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoyl catalpol), verminoside (6-O-3,4-Dihydroxy cinnamoyl catalpol), 6-O-veratroyl catalpol (6-O-3,4-Dimethoxy benzoyl catalpol), minecoside (6-O-3-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamoyl catalpol), catalpol and the like (Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2006-125499 A1); potent anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy and anti-asthma activity of the novel purified extract containing abundant active ingredients such as catalpol derivatives from the extract of Pseudolysimachion rotundum var subintegrum (ATC2: Korean Patent No. 1476045 B1, ATC1: Korean Patent No. 1504651 B1); and anti-COPD activity of those extract (Korean Patent No. 1476095 B1) till now.
       Pseudolysimachion rotundum var subintegrum, is a perennial herb distributed in Korea, China, Japan, Ostrov Sakhalin, and Russia.
      Based on the previous studies on the anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy and anti-asthma activity of the extract of Pseudolysimachion rotundum var subintegrum, the present inventors have tried to develop novel compound showing anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy, anti-asthma and anti-COPD activity isolated from the extract of Pseudolysimachion rotundum var subintegrum.
      However, there has been not reported or disclosed on novel compound showing anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy, anti-asthma and anti-COPD activity isolated from the extract of Pseudolysimachion rotundum var subintegrum in the above cited literatures, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
      Accordingly, the present inventors have found novel compound showing anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy, anti-asthma and anti-COPD activity isolated from the extract of Pseudolysimachion rotundum var subintegrum and the inventive compound showed potent anti-inflammatory, anti-allergy, anti-asthma and anti-COPD activity through various in vitro tests, for example, (1) cyto-toxicity test using by HT1080, H292 and EL4 cell line, (2) an inhibition test on the expression of MUC5AC (oligomeric mucus/gel-forming) induced by TNF-alpha, (3) NF-kappa B luciferase reporter assay, (4) inhibition test on the activity of NF-kappa B transcription factor; (5) inhibition on mRNA expression of target genes such as MMP-9, MUC5AC and IL-4 by way of inhibiting the NF-kappa B activity; (6) dose-dependent inhibiting effect on MUC5AC reproduction through MUC5AC protein reproduction assay; as well as in vivo tests, for example, (7) reducing effect on the number of inflammatory cells such as eosinophil using by OVA-sensitized/challenged mouse model, (8) inhibition test on the release of IgE, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 etc in BALF fluid and infiltration of inflamed cells, as well as the suppression of airway hyperresponsiveness and golblet cell hyperplasia, (9) an inhibition test using by COPD animal model (C57B/6N mouse) on the proliferation of inflammatory cells in BALF fluid, the inhibition on the reproduction of ROS (Reactive oxygen species), and activity of neutrophil elastase, the decreasing effect on the level of IL-6, TNF-alpha and the infiltrated inflammatory cells etc.

DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
"
0002735551,"BACKGROUND
      The primary function of Tau is to bind to and stabilize microtubules, which are important structural components of the cytoskeleton involved in mitosis, cytokinesis, and vesicular transport. Tau is found in multiple tissues, but is particularly abundant in axons of neurons. In humans, there are six isoforms of Tau that are generated by alternative splicing of exons 2, 3, and 10. Splicing of exons 2 and 3 at the N-terminus of the protein leads to inclusion of zero, one, or two 29 amino acid acidic domains and is termed 0N, 1N, or 2N Tau respectively. The influence of these domains on Tau function is not fully clear, though may play a role in interactions with the plasma membrane. Inclusion of exon 10 at the C-terminus leads to inclusion of the microtubule binding domain encoded by exon 10. Since there are 3 microtubule binding domains elsewhere in Tau, this Tau isoform (with exon 10 included) is termed 4R Tau, where ‘R’ refers to the number of repeats of microtubule binding domains. Tau without exon 10 is termed 3R Tau. Since more microtubule binding domains (4R compared with 3R) increases the binding to microtubules, 4R Tau presumably significantly increases microtubule binding and assembly. The ratio of 3R/4R Tau is developmentally regulated, with fetal tissues expressing exclusively 3R Tau and adult human tissues expressing approximately equal levels of 3R/4R Tau. Deviations from the normal ratio of 3R/4R Tau are characteristic of neurodegenerative FTD Tauopathies. It is not known how changing the 3R/4R Tau ratio at a later stage in the adult animal will affect Tau pathogenesis.
      Serine-threonine directed phosphorylation regulates the microtubule binding ability of Tau. Hyperphosphorylation promotes detachment of Tau from microtubules. Other post translational modifications of Tau have been described; however the significance of these is unclear. Phosphorylation of Tau is also developmentally regulated with higher phosphorylation in fetal tissues and much lower phosphorylation in the adult. One characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders is aberrantly increased Tau phosphorylation.
      The microtubule network is involved in many important processes within the cell including structural integrity needed for maintaining morphology of cells and operating transport machinery. Since binding of Tau to microtubules stabilizes microtubules, Tau is likely to be a key mediator of some of these processes and disruption of normal Tau in neurodegenerative diseases may disrupt some of these key cellular processes.
      One of the early indicators that Tau may be important in neurodegenerative syndromes was the recognition that Tau is a key component of neurofibrillary inclusions in Alzheimer's disease. In fact, neurofibrillary inclusions are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein. Along with amyloid beta containing plaques, neurofibrillary inclusions are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and correlate significantly with cognitive impairment. 95% of Tau accumulations in AD are found in neuronal processes and is termed neuritic dystrophy. The process(es) whereby this microtubule associated protein becomes disengaged from microtubules and forms accumulations of proteins and how this relates to neuronal toxicity is not well understood.
      Neuronal Tau inclusions are a pathological characteristic of not only Alzheimer's disease, but also a subset of Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), PSP, and CBD. The link between Tau and neurodegeneration was solidified by the discovery that mutations in the Tau gene cause a subset of FTD. These genetic data have also highlighted the importance of the 3R:4R ratio of Tau. Many of the Tau mutations that cause FTD lead to a change in Tau splicing which leads to preferential inclusion of exon 10, and thus to increased 4R Tau. The overall Tau levels are normal. Whether the Tau isoform change or the amino acid change or both cause neurodegeneration remains unknown. Recent data suggest that PSP may also be associated with an increased 4R:3R Tau ratio.
      To help understand the influence of Tau ratios on neurodegeneration, a mouse model based on one of the splicing Tau mutations (N279K) has been generated using a minigene that includes the Tau promoter and the flanking intronic sequences of exon 10. As in humans, these mice demonstrate increased levels of 4R Tau compared with transgenics expressing WT Tau and develop behavioral and motor abnormalities as well as accumulations of aggregated Tau in the brain and spinal cord.
      The protein “Tau” has been associated with multiple diseases of the brain including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, dementia pugilistica, parkinsonism linked to chromosome, Lytico-Bodig disease, tangle-predominant dementia, ganglioglioma, gangliocytoma, meningioangiomatosis, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, lead encephalopathy, tuberous sclerosis, Hallervorden-Spatz disease, Pick's disease, argyrophilic grain disease, corticobasal degeneration or frontotemporal lobar degeneration and others. Tau-associated disorders such as AD are the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. AD affects an estimated 15 million people worldwide and 40% of the population above 85 years of age. AD is characterized by two pathological hallmarks: Tau neurofibrillary inclusions (NFT) and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques.
      There is currently a lack of acceptable options for treating such neurodegenerative diseases. It is therefore an object herein to provide methods for the treatment of such diseases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002751235,"BACKGROUND
      Normally, mammalian lysosomal enzymes are synthesized in the cytosol and traverse the ER where they are glycosylated with N-linked, high mannose type carbohydrate. In the golgi, the high mannose carbohydrate is modified on lysosomal enzymes by the addition of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) which targets these proteins to the lysosome. The M6P-modified enzymes are then delivered to the lysosome via interaction with either/both of two M6P receptors.
      More than forty lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused, directly or indirectly, by the absence of one or more lysosomal enzymes in the lysosome. Enzyme replacement therapy for LSDs is being actively pursued. Therapy generally requires that LSD proteins be taken up and delivered to the lysosomes of a variety of cell types in an M6P-dependent fashion. One possible approach involves purifying an LSD protein and modifying it to incorporate a carbohydrate moiety with M6P. This modified material may be taken up by the cells more efficiently than unmodified LSD proteins due to interaction with M6P receptors on the cell surface.
      A peptide-based targeting technology that allows more efficient delivery of therapeutic enzymes to the lysosomes has been previously developed. This proprietary technology is termed Glycosylation Independent Lysosomal Targeting (GILT) because a peptide tag that is linked to the therapeutic enzyme replaces M6P as the moiety that targets the protein to the lysosomes. Details of the GILT technology are described in U.S. Application Publication Nos. 2003-0082176, 2004-0006008, 2003-0072761, 2005-0281805, 2005-0244400, U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,492,337 and 8,563,691, and International Publications WO 03/032913, WO 03/032727, WO 02/087510, WO 03/102583, WO 2005/078077, WO 2009/137721 and WO 2014/085621, the disclosures of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002491280,"BACKGROUND
      CRTH2 is a G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor, expressed on Th2 cells, eosinophils, and basophils (Nagata et al., J. Immunol., 162:1278-1286, 1999; Hirai et al., J. Exp. Med., 193: 255-261, 2001).
      Th2 polarization has been observed in allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis (Romagnani, S., Immunology Today, 18: 263-266, 1997; Hammad et al., Blood, 98: 1135-1141, 2001). Th2 cells regulate allergic diseases by producing Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (Oriss et al., J. Immunol., 162: 1999-2007, 1999; Viola et al., Blood, 91:2223-2230, 1998; Webb et al., J. Immunol., 165: 108-113, 2000; Dumont, F. J., Exp. Opin. Ther. Pat., 12: 341-367, 2002). These Th2 cytokines directly or indirectly induce migration, activation, priming and prolonged survival of effector cells, such as eosinophils and basophils, in allergic diseases (Sanz et al., J. Immunol., 160: 5637-5645, 1998; Pope et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 108: 594-601, 2001; Teran, L. M., Clin. Exp. Allergy, 29: 287-290, 1999).
      Prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2), a ligand for CRTH2, is produced from mast cells and other important effector cells in allergic diseases (Nagata et al., FEBS Lett., 459: 195-199, 1999; Hirai et al., J. Exp. Med., 193: 255-261, 2001). The activation of CRTH2 by PGD 2 induces the migration and activation of Th2 Cells and eosinophils, suggesting that CRTH2 may play a pro-inflammatory role in allergic diseases (Hirai et al., J. Exp. Med., 193: 255-261, 2001; Gervais et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 108: 982-988, 2001). Therefore, antagonists which inhibit the binding of CRTH2 and PGD 2 should be useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of allergic diseases, such as, asthma, exercise induced asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and allergic conjunctivitis.
      In addition, experimental evidence has demonstrated the contribution of eosinophils in sinusitis (Hamilos et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell and Mol. Biol., 15: 443-450, 1996; Fan et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 106: 551-558, 2000), and Churg-Strauss syndrome (Coffin et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 101: 116-123, 1998). In the tissues of these patients, mast cells can be observed to be colocalized with eosinophils (Khan et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 106: 1096: 1101, 2000). It is suggested that PGD 2 production from mast cells induces the recruitment of eosinophils. Therefore, CRTH2 antagonists are also useful for the treatment of other eosinophil-related diseases such as Churg-Strauss syndrome and sinusitis. CRTH2 antagonists can be useful for the treatment of some basophil-related diseases such as basophilic leukemia, chronic urticaria and basophilic leukocytosis, because of the high expression of CRTH2 on basophils.
      Thus, there is a need for compounds with CRTH2 antagonistic activity for the treatment or prophylaxis of CRTH2-mediated disorders or diseases.

200601799,"BACKGROUND
       The advent and continued development of telecommunication systems, including telecommunication systems that integrate voice, video, web services, and wireless communication systems, has led to an increased use and dependence thereon. Whether the dependence is a matter of necessity for business and/or emergency service applications or a matter of convenience for personal contexts of use, there is a need to quickly and easily re-establish a communication link in the instance the communication link is interrupted. Interruptions to a communication link may occur for a number of reasons, such as, for example, a loss of a cellular telephone call signal between two or more communication devices using a cellular communication network.
       One area of communication system design and applications in which improvement would be especially desirable relates to the reconnection of two or more communication devices that were previously communicating with each other. Accordingly, there exists a need to provide methods and apparatus for efficiently reconnecting two or more communication devices previously connected and communicating with each other, particularly in the instance the communication between the two or more devices is unexpectedly or undesirably interrupted.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
       Apparatus and methods are therefore presented for improved management and reconnection of telephone calls.
       According to some embodiments, a method of reconnecting a telephone call is provided herein. The method may include establishing a first telephone call between a first communication device associated with a telecommunication system and at least one other communication device. The first call may be unexpectedly or otherwise undesirably interrupted. In some instances, the call may end and one or more of the participants in the telephone call (i.e., user or caller), may want to reconnect with other participants of the terminated call. The method may allow for a telephone call to be initiated to the telecommunication system from the first communication device using a predetermined number. In response to the call to the predetermined number, the telecommunication system may initiate a reconnect call to establish a second call between the first communication device and the at least one other communication device.
       According to some embodiments, the first telephone call and the second telephone call may involve more than two communication devices, and the first communication device, at least, may be a wireless communication device (e.g., a cellular telephone).
       According to some embodiments, ANI (Automatic Number Identification) information of the first communication device that initiated the call to the telecommunication system using the predetermined number is extracted and used to identify a caller associated with the ANI information. The telecommunication system may use the knowledge of the identified caller and an awareness of a call history of the first communication device to reconnect the first communication device to the at least one other communication device.

0002759952,"BACKGROUND
      The rapidly evolving fields of cancer immunotherapy have recently led to the FDA approval of several new immunotherapies, with many more therapies presently in clinical trials for a variety of cancers. Furthermore, cellular, small molecule, antibody-based immunotherapies, and combinations thereof, are being rigorously tested preclinically for clinical translation. The dynamic tumor microenvironment and tumor heterogeneity have become important topics in both preclinical and clinical studies (Hanahan D, Weinberg R A. Cell 2011; 144:646-74; M antovani A, Allavena P, Sica A, Balkwill F. Nature 2008; 454:436-44; Schreiber R D, Old L J, Smyth M J. Science 2011; 331:1565-70.), but the ability to monitor changes in the immune status of primary lesions and metastatic cancers is limited. Current methods to monitor lymphocytes from whole blood or biopsies from heterogeneous tumors do not reflect the dynamic and spatial information likely required to monitor immune responses to therapeutic intervention, many of which elicit whole body changes in immune cell numbers and localization. Therefore, molecular imaging methods that can noninvasively monitor both systemic and intratumoral alterations in immune cell numbers or localization during experimental therapies have the ability to increase the understanding of the dynamics of immunotherapeutic mechanism with the potential to provide translatable methods for predicting and/or assessing clinical immunotherapeutic responses.
      Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has demonstrated the importance of tumor immune microenvironment and that the presence of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells can predict overall survival in breast, lung, ovarian, melanoma, and colorectal cancers (reviewed in refs. Pages F, et al. Oncogene 2010; 29:1093-102. and Gooden M J, et al. Br J Cancer 2011; 105:93-103.). With the recent clinical successes of immunotherapies that alter the tumor immune microenvironment, including adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of T-cell receptor (TCR)- or chimeric antigen receptor-transduced cytotoxic T cells (Johnson L A, et al. Blood 2009; 114:535-46; Rosenberg S A. Sci Transl Med 2012; 4:127ps8.), agonistic antibodies targeting CD137 (4-1BB) and CD40 (Melero I, et al. Clin Cancer Res 2013; 19:997-1008; Melero I, et al. Nat Rev Cancer 2007; 7:95-106; Vinay D S, and Kwon B S. Mol Cancer Ther 2012; 11:1062-70.), and antibody blockade of the checkpoint inhibitors CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1 (Callahan M K, and Wolchok J D. J Leukoc Biol 2013; 94:41-53; Shin D S, and Ribas A. Curr Opin Immunol 2015; 33C:23-35; Topalian S L, et al. Cancer Cell 2015; 27:450-61.), the ability to noninvasively monitor the tumor immune response to therapy has become of upmost importance.

0002624028,"BACKGROUND
      Lipoproteins are globular, micelle-like particles that consist of a non-polar core of acylglycerols and cholesteryl esters surrounded by an amphiphilic coating of protein, phospholipid and cholesterol. Lipoproteins have been classified into five broad categories on the basis of their functional and physical properties: chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Chylomicrons transport dietary lipids from intestine to tissues. VLDLs, IDLs and LDLs all transport triacylglycerols and cholesterol from the liver to tissues. HDLs transport endogenous cholesterol from tissues to the liver
      Lipoprotein particles undergo continuous metabolic processing and have variable properties and compositions. Lipoprotein densities increase without increasing particle diameter because the density of their outer coatings is less than that of the inner core. The protein components of lipoproteins are known as apolipoproteins. At least nine apolipoproteins are distributed in significant amounts among the various human lipoproteins.
      The lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] particle was identified nearly 50 years ago and is comprised of a highly unique LDL particle in which one apolipoprotein B (apoB) protein is linked via a disulfide bond to a single apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)] protein. The apo(a) protein shares a high degree of homology with plasminogen particularly within the kringle IV type 2 repetitive domain. Levels of circulating Lp(a) are inversely proportional to the number of kringle IV type 2 variable repeats present in the molecule and, as both alleles are co-expressed within individuals, can display heterozygous plasma isoform profiles (Kraft et al., Eur J Hum Genet, 1996; 4(2): 74-87). It is thought that this kringle repeat domain in apo(a) may be responsible for its pro-thrombotic and anti-fibrinolytic properties, potentially enhancing atherosclerotic progression.
      Apo(a) is transcriptionally regulated by IL-6 and in studies in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with an IL-6 inhibitor (tocilizumab), plasma levels were reduced by 30% after 3 month treatment (Schultz et al., PLoS One 2010; 5:e14328).
      Apo(a) has been shown to preferentially bind oxidized phospholipids and potentiate vascular inflammation (Bergmark et al., J Lipid Res 2008; 49:2230-2239; Tsimikas et al., Circulation. 2009; 119(13):1711-1719).
      Further, studies suggest that the Lp(a) particle may also stimulate endothelial permeability, induce plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 expression and activate macrophage interleukin-8 secretion (Koschinsky and Marcovina, Curr Opin Lipidol 2004; 15:167-174). Importantly, recent genetic association studies revealed that Lp(a) was an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm (Rifai et al., Clin Chem 2004; 50:1364-71; Erqou et al., JAMA 2009; 302:412-23; Kamstrup et al., Circulation 2008; 117:176-84). Further, in the recent Precocious Coronary Artery Disease (PROCARDIS) study, Clarke et al. (Clarke et al., NEJM (2009)361; 2518-2528) described robust and independent associations between coronary heart disease and plasma Lp(a) concentrations. Additionally, Solfrizzi et al., suggested that increased serum Lp(a) may be linked to an increased risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Solfrizzi et al., J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2002, 72:732-736. Currently, in the clinic setting, examples of indirect apo(a) inhibitors for treating cardiovascular disease include aspirin, Niaspan, Mipomersen, Anacetrapib, Epirotirome and Lomitapide which reduce plasma Lp(a) levels by 18%, 39%, 32%, 36%, 43% and 17%, respectively. Additionally, Lp(a) apheresis has been used in the clinic to reduce apo(a) containing Lp(a) particles.
      To date, therapeutic strategies to treat cardiovascular disease by directly targeting apo(a) levels have been limited. Ribozyme oligonucleotides (U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,022) and antisense oligonucleotides (WO 2005/000201; WO 2003/014397; U.S. Pat. No. 8,138,328; Merki et al., J Am Coll Cardiol 2011; 57:1611-1621) have been developed, but none of the compounds directly targeting apo(a) are currently used in the clinic.
      Thus, there remains a clear unmet medical need for novel agents which can potently and selectively reduce apo(a) levels in patients at enhanced risk for cardiovascular events due to chronically elevated plasma Lp(a) levels.

0002639518,"BACKGROUND ART
      Cancer is the overall leading cause of death. At present, the primary form of cancer treatment technique is surgical treatment, which is carried out in combination with radiation treatment and chemotherapy. In spite of the development of novel surgical techniques and the discovery of novel anticancer agents of recent years, outcomes from cancer treatment still remain unimproved, except in the cases of some types of cancer. In recent years, cancer antigens recognized by cytotoxic T cells that are reactive to cancer and genes encoding cancer antigens have been identified along with the development of molecular biology and cancer immunology, and expectations for antigen-specific immunotherapy have increased (Tsuyoshi Akiyoshi, Gan to Kagaku Ryouhou (Cancer and Chemotherapy), 1997, vol. 24, pp. 551-519, Cancer and Chemotherapy Publishers Inc., Japan).
      Immunotherapy requires the cancer-cell-specific presence of a peptide, polypeptide, or protein that is recognized as a target antigen, as well as substantial absence thereof in normal cells from the viewpoint of alleviation of side effects. In 1991, Boon et al. (the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Belgium) isolated the human melanoma antigen MAGE1 recognized by the CD8+ T cell via cDNA expression cloning using an autologous cancer cell line and cancer-reactive T cells (Bruggen P. et al., Science, 254: 1643-1647, 1991). Thereafter, the SEREX (serological identifications of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) method, which identifies the tumor antigen recognized by the antibody produced in response to autologous cancer in the body of a cancer patient via gene expression cloning was reported (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 92: 11810-11813, 1995; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,396). Some cancer antigens have been isolated by such techniques (Int. J. Cancer, 72: 965-971, 1997; Cancer Res., 58: 1034-1041, 1998; Int. J. Cancer, 29: 652-658, 1998; Int. J. Oncol., 14: 703-708, 1999; Cancer Res., 56: 4766-4772, 1996; and Hum. Mol. Genet. 6: 33-39, 1997). In addition, clinical testing of cancer immunotherapy targeting some such antigitens has been initiated.
      As in the case of humans, dogs and cats are known to suffer from a variety of tumors, such as mammary gland cancer, leukemia, and lymphoma, and tumors are highly ranked in statistics for canine or feline diseases. However, there are no effective therapeutic, preventive, or diagnostic agents for canine or feline cancer at present. Most dog or cat owners would not notice canine or feline tumors until tumors become advanced and enlarged. Even if tumors are removed via surgical operation or drugs for human use (e.g., anticancer drugs) are administered, tumors are often already beyond cure, and animals often die shortly after treatment. Under such circumstances, if therapeutic, preventive, and diagnostic agents for cancer that are effective for dogs or cats become available, application thereof for canine or feline cancer can be expected.
      The cytoplasmic and proliferation-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN-1) is expressed when dormant normal cells are activated or undergo cell division. CAPRIN-1 is an intracellular protein that is known to form intracellular stress granules with RNA in the cell and to be associated with regulation of mRNA transportation and translation. CAPRIN-1 is also known by various other names, and examples thereof include the GPI-anchored membrane protein 1 and the membrane component surface marker 1 protein (M11S1). CAPRIN-1 has names that convey the impression that it has been known as a cell membrane protein. Such other names derive from a report to the effect that the CAPRIN-1 gene sequence has a GPI-binding region and it is a membrane protein expressed in a large-intestine-derived cell line (J. Biol. Chem., 270: 20717-20723, 1995). Later, however, it was known that the CAPRIN-1 gene sequence in this report was incorrect, and in the gene sequence, deletion of a single nucleotide from the CAPRIN-1 gene sequence currently registered in the GenBank or the like causes a frame shift, thereby leading to deletion of 80 amino acids from the C terminus, and therefore the resulting artifact (74 amino acids) was the GPI-binding region mentioned in the foregoing report. In addition, it was also known that the CAPRIN-1 gene sequence shown in the report also had an error at the 5′ side, and 53 amino acid residues had been deleted from the N-terminus (J. Immunol., 172: 2389-2400, 2004). It has also been reported that the protein encoded by the CAPRIN-1 gene sequence currently registered in GenBank or the like is not a cell membrane protein (J. Immunol., 172: 2389-2400, 2004).
      Based on the report of J. Biol. Chem., 270: 20717-20723, 1995, that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein, US 2008/0075722 and WO 2005/100998 describe that CAPRIN-1 can be a target of cancer therapy as a cell membrane protein under the name of M11S1. However, they do not include any specific descriptions in the Examples. As reported in J. Immunol., 172: 2389-2400, 2004, however, it has been heretofore accepted since US 2008/0075722 was filed that CAPRIN-1 is not expressed on a cell surface. It is apparent that the disclosures of US 2008/0075722 and WO 2005/100998 based only on the incorrect information that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein should not be understood as general technical knowledge in the art. In addition, there is no report that the expression level of CAPRIN-1 is higher in cancer cells such as breast cancer cells than in normal cells.

","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problem to be Solved by the Invention
      It is an object of the present invention to discover a novel polypeptide useful for a therapeutic and/or preventive agent for cancer and to provide use of such polypeptide as an immunity-inducing agent.
Means for Solving the Problem
      The present inventors have conducted concentrated studies, and then they obtained cDNAs encoding proteins that bind to antibodies in the serum obtained from a cancer-bearing living body by the SEREX method using a canine-testicular-tissue-derived cDNA library and the serum of a dog afflicted with breast cancer, and they prepared a canine CAPRIN-1 polypeptide having the amino acid sequences shown by SEQ ID NOs: 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 using such cDNAs. Using the human homologous gene of the obtained gene, also, they prepared a human CAPRIN-1 polypeptide having the amino acid sequences as shown by SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4. Further, they found that such CAPRIN-1 polypeptides were expressed specifically in a breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, esophagus cancer, and colorectal cancer. Furthermore, they found that administration of such CAPRIN-1 polypeptides to living bodies would lead to induction of immunocytes against CAPRIN-1 polypeptides in the living bodies and regression of tumors in living bodies expressing the CAPRIN-1 genes. In addition, they found that the antibodies against such CAPRIN-1 polypeptides would disrupt cancer cells that express the CAPRIN-1 genes and induce antitumor effects in vivo.

200870597,"BACKGROUND ART
      Pathologies of the cardiovascular system are now one of the most prominent causes of death in medium to highly industrialized countries.
      Atherosclerosis is a cardiovascular pathology characterized by hardening and narrowing of the arteries that occurs in most people when growing old. Atherosclerosis does not usually display symptoms until the flow within blood vessels has been seriously compromised. Typical symptoms of atherosclerosis include chest pain, when a coronary artery is involved, or leg pain, when a leg artery is involved. Possible complications of atherosclerosis include apoplexy, necrosis, and coronary artery disease (one symptom of which is angina) with ischemia and infarct.
      On the basis of that which has been stated above, it is clear there is still a considerable need to make drugs available for the treatment of atherosclerosis and correlated pathologies.
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION
","DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION
      It is an object of the present invention to provide new possibilities in the treatment of atherosclerosis and correlated pathologies.
      According to the current invention, there are provided methods for the treatment of atherosclerosis and correlated pathologies and uses of diphtheria toxin derivatives in the preparation of drugs for the treatment of atherosclerosis and correlated pathologies as claimed in the independent claims that follow at the end of this description, and, preferably, in any one of the single claims directly or indirectly dependent on the independent claims.
      Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, the following terms have the meaning indicated below.
      In the present text “percentage of identity” and “% of identity” between two amino acid sequences means the percentage of identical amino acid residues in corresponding positions in the two sequences in optimum alignment.
      To determine the “percentage of identity” of the two amino acid sequences or of nucleic acids, the sequences are mutually aligned to reach an optimum comparison. Gaps (that is, cancellations or insertions) can be introduced into the sequence. The amino acids in corresponding positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid that occupies the corresponding position in the second sequence, the molecules are identical in that position (that is, the position is identical). The percentage of identity between the two sequences is the result of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences [that is the percentage of identity=(number of identical positions/total number of positions)×100]. According to a preferred embodiment, the sequences are of the same length.
      The compared sequences may present gaps.
      The percentage of identity can be obtained by means of mathematical algorithms. A non restrictive example of a mathematical algorithm used for the comparison of two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul [(1990), Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA 87: 2264-2268] modified by Karli and Altschul [(1993). Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA 90: 5873-5877]. Such an algorithm is incorporated in Altschul's BLASTn and BLASTp programs [Altschul, et al, (1990). J Mol Biol 215: 403-410].
      To obtain alignments also in the presence of one or more gaps it is possible to use methods that assign a relatively high penalty to each gap and a lower penalty to each additional amino acid residue or nucleotide in the gap (such additional amino acid residue or nucleotide is defined as an extension to the gap). Obviously, high penalties will determine optimized alignments with a smaller number of gaps.
      An example of a program suitable for the realization of this type of alignment is the BLAST program that Altschul et al. described [(1997). Nucleic Acids Res 25: 3389-3402]. To this end, the BLASTn e BLASTp programs can be used with the default parameters. The matrix BLOSUM62 is usually adopted when using the BLAST program.
      A preferred and non restrictive example of a program for obtaining an optimum alignment is GCG Winsconsin Bestfit package [University of Winsconsin, USA; Devereux et al. (1984). Nucleic Acids Research 12:387]. Also in this case default parameters are used, that for a sequence of amino acids foresee a penalty of −12 for a gap and a penalty of −4 for each extension.
      In the current text by “homologous positions” is meant positions that have two homologous amino acids, that is amino acids endowed with similar physicochemical properties. For example, amino acids belonging to the same groups such as: aromatic (Phe, Trp, Tyr), acid (Glu, Asp), polar (Gln, Asn), basic (Lys, Arg, His), aliphatic (Ala, Leu, Ile, Val), with one hydroxy group (Ser, Thr), with short lateral chain (Gly, Ala, Ser, Thr, Met). One would expect that replacements between such homologous amino acids would not change the phenotype of the protein (preservative replacement of amino acids). Specific examples of preservative replacement are well known in this technical field and are described in various works [e.g., Bowie et al. (1990). Science 247:1306-1310].
      In the current text by “stringent conditions” is meant, preferably, a washing of one hour with buffer SSC (0.15 M sodium chloride solution and 20 mM sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecil sulphate) at 50° C. Alternatively, “stringent conditions” have been described in the past [Ausubel F M et al. eds. (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Vol. I, Green Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley & Sons Inc. New York].
      In the current text by “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” is meant a salt or a complex (i.e. a compound in which one or more molecules or ions form one or more coordinate bonds to one or more metal atoms or metal ions) that maintains the biological properties of the original molecule. Non limiting examples of methodologies for the preparation of such derivatives include the following items: addition of inorganic acids (for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid or the like) or of organic acids (for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, metasulfonic acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, citric acid or the like) to the free base of the original molecule; replacement of a proton acid of the original molecule with a metallic cation (for example, a cation of an alkaline metal or of an aluminum or the like); transfer of a proton acid of the original compound to an organic base (for example, dimethylamine, triethylamine, and the like) and coordination with such an organic base. The molecules that are the subject of the current invention are to be understood, unless the contrary is specified, as comprising their “pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives”.

0002762367,"BACKGROUND
      Gene therapy is a method in which therapeutic genes are delivered into cells of patients using gene recombinant technology to induce genetic mutations of target cells or express particular proteins, thereby treating genetic diseases, incurable diseases, and the like. Substances that carry the genes into living bodies are called carriers or vectors. Vectors are largely classified into viral vectors and non-viral vectors. Retroviruses and adenoviruses are representative types of viral vectors, and non-viral vectors include naked DNA, liposomes, and the like.
      Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the growth factors, and research on various functions of HGF is ongoing. Examples thereof are as follows: (1) the treatment of heart disease by HGF using liposome as carrier (Aoki et al., Angiogenesis induced by hepatocyte growth factor in non-infarcted myocardium and infracted myocardium: up-regulation of essential transcription factor for angiogenesis, etc. Gene Therapy 7:417-427, 2000); (2) the treatment of liver disease by HGF using AAV as carrier (Suzumura et al., Adeno-associated virus vector-mediated production of hepatocyte growth factor attenuates liver fibrosis in mice. Hepatol. Int. 2:80-88, 2008); (3) the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy by HGF using naked DNA as carrier (Kessler et al., Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of HGF gene therapy in diabetic neuropathy. Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology 2:465-478, 2015); and (4) the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by HGF using naked DNA as carrier (Sufit et al., Open label study to assess the safety of VM202 in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener 18:269-278, 2017).
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
Technical Problem
      The present inventors have researched and endeavored to develop a gene delivery system with increased delivery efficiency of a hybrid HGF gene that simultaneously expresses hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) isoforms including flHGF and dHGF. As a result, the present inventors have established that gene delivery efficiency can be significantly improved when a downsized mutant of a previously known hybrid HGF gene and adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a gene delivery system are used, and thus have completed the present invention.
      Therefore, an aspect of the present invention is to provide an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector into which a foreign nucleic acid sequence consisting of a predetermined nucleotide sequence is introduced.
      Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a transformant transformed with the above-described AAV vector.
      Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide a composition comprising the above-described AAV vector for the prevention or treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
      Other purposes and advantages of the present disclosure will become more obvious when taken with the following detailed description of the invention, claims, and drawings.
Technical Solution
      In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector, into which a foreign nucleic acid sequence consisting of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 is introduced.
      The present inventors have researched and endeavored to develop a gene delivery system with increased delivery efficiency of a hybrid HGF gene that simultaneously expresses hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) isoforms including flHGF and dHGF. As a result, the present inventors have established that gene delivery efficiency can be significantly improved when a downsized mutant of a previously known hybrid HGF gene and adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a gene delivery system are used.
      As used herein, the term “hybrid HGF gene” refers to a gene sequence that simultaneously expresses two or more HGF isoforms by selective splicing. More specifically, the above-described two or more HGF isoforms include at least a full-length HGF (flHGF) isoform and a deleted variant HGF (dHGF) isoform.
      Due to the degeneracy of codons or considering preferred codons in an organism where the HGF and dHGF genes are to be expressed, the hybrid HGF gene of the present invention may have various alterations in a coding region within the range that does not change the amino acid sequence of a protein expressed from the coding region, or may also have various alterations or modifications in a region other than the coding region within a range that does not affect the expression of the gene, and such altered or modified genes are also included in the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention also includes a polynucleotide having substantially the same nucleotide sequence as the hybrid HGF gene of SEQ ID NO: 5, and fragments of the gene. The substantially the same polynucleotide means a polynucleotide having a sequence homology of at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, and the most preferably at least 95%.
      The above-described hybrid HGF gene may include cDNA, corresponding to exons 1 to 18 of the human HGF gene and intron 4 of the human HGF gene, inserted between exons 4 and 5 of the cDNA, or fragments thereof. This sequence is known to be HGF-X7 consisting of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 (see KR 2017-0024614 (published on 7 Mar. 2017)). However, when inserted into an AAV vector, the above-described nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 has size-related limitations. The nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 of the present invention corresponds to a sequence showing significantly increased gene delivery efficiency among sequences which are downsized by removing a part of the sequence corresponding to the intron 4 fragment of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. Specifically, the delivery of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 to a subject through introduction into an AAV vector shows significantly increased gene delivery efficiency and expression efficiency compared with the use of the previously known HGF-X8 of SEQ ID NO: 7 through introduction into the AAV vector.
      A polynucleotide may be delivered to a subject in a naked DNA state or a state of being contained in a gene delivery system. It has been known that a plasmid, a viral vector, or the like may be used as a gene delivery system, but, as described above, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector is used as a gene delivery system in the present invention.
      AAA vectors may infect non-dividing cells and may infect various kinds of cells. Detailed descriptions of the construction and use of AAA vectors are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,139,941 and 4,797,368. The research results on AAV as a gene delivery system are disclosed in LaFace et al, Virology, 162:483486 (1988), Zhou et al., Exp. Hematol. (NY), 21:928-933 (1993); Walsh et al, J. Clin. Invest., 94:1440-1448 (1994); and Flotte et al., Gene Therapy, 2:29-37 (1995). Typically, AAV viruses are produced by co-transfection of a plasmid comprising a target gene sequence flanked by two AAV terminal repeats (McLaughlin et al., J. Virol., 62:1963-1973 (1988); and Samulski et al., J. Virol., 63:3822-3828 (1989)), an expression plasmid comprising a wild-type AAV coding sequence without terminal repeats, and a plasmid comprising an adenovirus helper gene (McCarty et al., J. Virol., 65:2936-2945 (1991)).
      The AAV vector of the present invention may be used to deliver a foreign gene sequence into cells by various viral infection methods known in the art, and the methods are not particularly limited.
      The AAV vector of the present invention has an AAV serotype selected from the group consisting of AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAV10, AAV11, AAV12, AAV13, AAV14, AAV15, and AAV16.
      According to another aspect of the present invention, the present invention provides a transformant transformed with the above-described AAV vector.
      The AAV vector of the present invention can be introduced into appropriate host cells, for example, mammalian cells, such as 293T cells, or insect cells, or the like, and the transformed host cells can be used to make mass-replication of DNA of the gene of the present invention or mass-production of a protein thereof.
      In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a composition comprising the above-described AAV vector for prevention or treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
      As used herein, the term “prevention” refers to all acts of suppressing diabetic peripheral neuropathy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through administration of the composition of the present invention.
      As used herein, the term “treatment” refers to (a) the delay or suppression of the progression/development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; (b) the relief of diabetic peripheral neuropathy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and (c) the removal of diabetic peripheral neuropathy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
      The composition of the present invention may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
      The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier contained in the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is one that is typically used for formulation, and examples thereof may include, but are not limited to, lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starch, acacia gum, calcium phosphate, alginate, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, methyl cellulose, methyl hydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxybenzoate, talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oils. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may further comprise, in addition to the above ingredients, a lubricant, a wetting agent, a sweetening agent, a flavoring agent, an emulsifier, a suspending agent, a preservative, and the like. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and preparations are described in detail in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (19th ed., 1995).
      The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be preferably administered parenterally, and for example, intravenous administration, intraperitoneal administration, intramuscular injection, subcutaneous administration, intrathecal administration, intracerebroventricular injection, intracerebral injection, or topical administration may be used.
      The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be formulated and administered as an injection. The appropriate dose of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention varies depending on factors, such as the method of formulation, the manner of administration, the patient's age, body weight, and gender, the severity of disease symptoms, the time of administration, the route of administration, the excretion rate, and response sensitivity. An ordinarily skilled practitioner can easily determine and prescribe the dose effective for desired treatment. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the AAV vector of the present invention is administered in an amount of 1×10 8 to 1×10 12 GC/site.
      The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is formulated using a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipient according to a method that could be easily performed by a person having ordinary skills in the art to which the present invention pertains, and the pharmaceutical composition may be prepared into a unit dosage form, or may be inserted into a multi-dose container. The formulation may be in the form of a solution, suspension, or emulsion in an oily or aqueous medium, or an extract, a powder, granules, a tablet, or a capsule, and the formulation may further comprise a dispersant or a stabilizer.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002691102,"BACKGROUND
      Huntington's Disease (HD), also known as Huntington's Chorea, is a progressive disorder of motor, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. The mean age of onset for this disease is age 35-44 years, although in about 10% of cases, onset occurs prior to age 21, and the average lifespan post-diagnosis of the disease is 15-18 years. Prevalence is about 3 to 7 among 100,000 people of western European descent.
      Huntington's Disease is an example of a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders were first characterized in the early 1990s (see Di Prospero and Fischbeck (2005) Nature Reviews Genetics 6:756-765). These disorders involve the localized expansion of unstable repeats of sets of three nucleotides and can result in loss of function of the gene in which the expanded repeat resides, a gain of toxic function, or both. Trinucleotide repeats can be located in any part of the gene, including non-coding and coding gene regions. Repeats located within the coding regions typically involve either a repeated glutamine encoding triplet (CAG) or an alanine encoding triplet (CGA). Expanded repeat regions within non-coding sequences can lead to aberrant expression of the gene while expanded repeats within coding regions (also known as codon reiteration disorders) may cause mis-folding and protein aggregation. The exact cause of the pathophysiology associated with the aberrant proteins is often not known. Typically, in the wild-type genes that are subject to trinucleotide expansion, these regions contain a variable number of repeat sequences in the normal population, but in the afflicted populations, the number of repeats can increase from a doubling to a log order increase in the number of repeats. In HD, repeats are inserted within the N terminal coding region of the large cytosolic protein Huntingtin (Htt). Normal Htt alleles contain 15-20 CAG repeats, while alleles containing 35 or more repeats can be considered potentially HD causing alleles and confer risk for developing the disease. Alleles containing 36-39 repeats are considered incompletely penetrant, and those individuals harboring those alleles may or may not develop the disease (or may develop symptoms later in life) while alleles containing 40 repeats or more are considered completely penetrant. In fact, no asymptomatic persons containing HD alleles with this many repeats have been reported. Those individuals with juvenile onset HD (<21 years of age) are often found to have 60 or more CAG repeats. In addition to an increase in CAG repeats, it has also been shown that HD can involve+1 and +2 frameshifts within the repeat sequences such that the region will encode a poly-serine polypeptide (encoded by AGC repeats in the case of a +1 frameshift) track rather than poly-glutamine (Davies and Rubinsztein (2006) Journal of Medical Genetics 43: 893-896).
      In HD, the mutant Htt allele is usually inherited from one parent as a dominant trait. Any child born of a HD patient has a 50% chance of developing the disease if the other parent was not afflicted with the disorder. In some cases, a parent may have an intermediate HD allele and be asymptomatic while, due to repeat expansion, the child manifests the disease. In addition, the HD allele can also display a phenomenon known as anticipation wherein increasing severity or decreasing age of onset is observed over several generations due to the unstable nature of the repeat region during spermatogenesis.
      Furthermore, trinucleotide expansion in Htt leads to neuronal loss in the medium spiny gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) projection neurons in the striatum, with neuronal loss also occurring in the neocortex. Medium spiny neurons that contain enkephalin and that project to the external globus pallidum are more involved than neurons that contain substance P and project to the internal globus pallidum. Other brain areas greatly affected in people with Huntington's disease include the substantia nigra, cortical layers 3, 5, and 6, the CA1 region of the hippocampus, the angular gyms in the parietal lobe, Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the centromedialparafascicular complex of the thalamus (Walker (2007) Lancet 369:218-228).
      The role of the normal Htt protein is poorly understood, but it may be involved in neurogenesis, apoptotic cell death, and vesicle trafficking. In addition, there is evidence that wild-type Htt stimulates the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a pro-survival factor for the striatal neurons. It has been shown that progression of HD correlates with a decrease in BDNF expression in mouse models of HD (Zuccato et at (2005) Pharmacological Research 52(2): 133-139), and that delivery of either BDNF or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) via adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery may protect straital neurons in mouse models of HD (Kells et al, (2004) Molecular Therapy 9(5): 682-688).
      Diagnostic and treatment options for HD are currently very limited. In terms of diagnostics, altered (mutant) Htt (mHTT) levels are significantly associated with disease burden score, and soluble mHTT species increase in concentration with disease progression. However, low-abundance mHTT is difficult to quantify in the patient CNS, which limits both study of the role in the neuropathobiology of HD in vivo, and precludes the demonstration of target engagement by HTT-lowering drugs. See, e.g., Wild et al. (2014) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 85:e4.
      With regard to treatment, some potential methodologies designed to prevent the toxicities associated with protein aggregation that occurs through the extended poly-glutamine tract such as overexpression of chaperonins or induction of the heat shock response with the compound geldanamycin have shown a reduction in these toxicities in in vitro models. Other treatments target the role of apoptosis in the clinical manifestations of the disease. For example, slowing of disease symptoms has been shown via blockage of caspase activity in animal models in the offspring of a pairing of mice where one parent contained a HD allele and the other parent had a dominant negative allele for caspase 1. Additionally, cleavage of mutant HD Htt by caspase may play a role in the pathogenicity of the disease. Transgenic mice carrying caspase-6 resistant mutant Htt were found to maintain normal neuronal function and did not develop striatal neurodegeneration as compared to mice carrying a non-caspase resistant mutant Htt allele (see Graham et at (2006) Cell 125: 1179-1191). Molecules which target members of the apoptotic pathway have also been shown to have a slowing effect on symptomology. For example, the compounds zVAD-fmk and minocycline, both of which inhibit caspase activity, have been shown to slow disease manifestation in mice. The drug remacemide has also been used in small HD human trials because the compound was thought to prevent the binding of the mutant Htt to the NDMA receptor to prevent the exertion of toxic effects on the nerve cell. However, no statistically significant improvements were observed in neuron function in these trials. In addition, the Huntington Study Group conducted a randomized, double-blind study using Coenzyme Q. Although a trend towards slower disease progression among patients that were treated with coenzyme Q10 was observed, there was no significant change in the rate of decline of total functional capacity. (Di Prospero and Fischbeck, ibid).
      Recombinant transcription factors comprising the DNA binding domains from zinc finger proteins (“ZFPs”), TAL-effector domains (“TALEs”) and CRISPR/Cas transcription factor systems have the ability to regulate gene expression of endogenous genes (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,586,526; 6,534,261; 6,599,692; 6,503,717; 6,689,558; 7,067,317; 7,262,054; Perez-Pinera et al. (2013) Nature Methods 10:973-976; Platek et al. (2014) Plant Biotechnology J. doi: 10.1111/pbi.12284). Clinical trials using these engineered transcription factors containing zinc finger proteins have shown that these novel transcription factors are capable of treating various conditions. (see, e.g., Yu et al. (2006) FASEB J. 20:479-481). In addition, artificial nucleases comprising the DNA binding domains from zinc finger proteins (“ZFPs”), TAL-effector domains (“TALEs”), Ttago and CRISPR/Cas or Ttago nuclease systems have the ability to modify gene expression of endogenous genes via nuclease-mediated modification of the gene, including either homology directed repair (HDR), following non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and/or by end capture during non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) driven processes. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,623,618; 8,034,598; 8,586,526; 6,534,261; 6,599,692; 6,503,717; 6,689,558; 7,067,317; 7,262,054; 7,888,121; 7,972,854; 7,914,796; 7,951,925; 8,110,379; 8,409,861; U.S. Patent Publications 20030232410; 20050208489; 20050026157; 20060063231; 20080159996; 201000218264; 20120017290; 20110265198; 20130137104; 20130122591; 20130177983; 20130177960 and 20150056705, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties for all purposes. Thus, these methods often involve the use of engineered cleavage systems to induce a double strand break (DSB) or a nick in a target DNA sequence such that repair of the break by an error born process such as non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or repair using a repair template (homology directed repair or HDR) can result in the knock out of a gene or the insertion of a sequence of interest (targeted integration). Introduction of a double strand break in the absence of an externally supplied repair template (e.g. “donor” or “transgene”) is commonly used for the inactivation of the targeted gene via mutations (insertions and/or deletions known as “indels”) introduced by the cellular NHEJ pathway. For instance, U.S. Patent Publication 20110082093 discloses specific zinc finger proteins targeted to Htt and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20130253040 relates to DNA-binding proteins that modulate expression of an HD allele such as Htt.
      However, there remains a need for methods for the diagnosis, study, treatment and/or prevention of Huntington's Disease, including detection of mHTT for monitoring disease progression, for increased understanding of the neuropathobiology of HD and to evaluate disease-modifying HD therapeutics.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      Disclosed herein are methods and compositions for diagnosing and/or treating Huntington's Disease. In particular, provided herein are methods and compositions for detecting, reducing and/or eliminating Htt aggregates, ameliorating motor deficits, increasing cellular activity (e.g., ATP activity) and/or reducing apoptosis in subject with HD.
      Thus, in one aspect, described here is a method of modifying a neuron in a subject with HD, the method comprising administering a repressor of a mutant Htt allele to the subject such that the neuron is modified. In certain embodiments, the neuron is a neuron that comprises a mutant Htt allele and/or that comprises an increased amount of intracellular aggregated Htt (an “HD neuron”). In certain embodiments, the modification comprises reducing the aggregation of Htt in the neuron (e.g., an HD neuron); increasing neuron (e.g., an HD neuron) energy metabolism, e.g., by increasing intracellular ATP levels; and/or reducing susceptibility to apoptosis in the neuron (e.g., an HD neuron). In certain embodiments, the subject is a mammal.
      Thus, in other aspects, described herein is a method of preventing and/or reducing the formation of Htt aggregates in HD neurons of a subject with HD, the method comprising administering a repressor of a mutant Htt allele to the subject.
      In other aspects, described herein is a method of increasing cellular activity (e.g., ATP activity) in a neuron (e.g., an HD neuron), the method comprising administering a repressor of a mutant Htt allele to the neuron.
      In other aspects, described herein is a method of reducing apoptosis in a neuron (e.g., an HD neuron), the method comprising administering a repressor of a mutant Htt allele to the neuron.
      In another aspect, described herein is a method for reducing motor deficits (e.g., clasping) in HD subjects in need thereof by administering a repressor of a mutant Htt allele to the subject in need thereof.
      In yet another aspect, described herein is a method for detecting mHtt in a subject (e.g., in the CSF), including detecting mHtt in response to therapy (e.g., in response to administration of an Htt repressor as described herein). In certain embodiments, the detecting involves quantifying the amount of mHtt in the subject. Any of the detection methods described herein can be used for diagnosis of HD and/or for monitoring of disease progression, as mHTT levels are significantly associated with disease burden score and mHTT levels increase in concentration as the disease progresses.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002733495,"BACKGROUND
      Microorganisms permit production of recombinant proteins at high levels in relatively short periods of time. Moreover, many microorganisms can be genetically modified relatively easily to express a protein of interest at a high level. Accordingly, microorganisms are one of the cell types of choice for production of proteins for industrial application, e.g., for therapeutic or diagnostic or cosmetic applications.
      For many applications, proteins expressed in microorganisms must be extracted and purified to at least some extent. To purify these proteins it is often necessary to lyse the cell using methods known in the art such as homogenization or chemical lysis. However, releasing proteins by these methods also results in the release of a large number of additional proteins, as well as nucleic acids, lipids, endotoxins and other cell components from the microorganism. This is particularly the case when purifying proteins that are soluble within a microorganism, as opposed to proteins included in aggregates or inclusion bodies, since many of the contaminants are also soluble within the microorganism. These contaminating proteins and other substances are often extracted with the protein of interest. Accordingly, the protein of interest must then be purified to remove these contaminants. Higher concentrations of contaminants can require more purification steps and/or more reagents, resulting in increased cost to produce a purified protein.
      Traditional protein extraction methods also often make use of organic solvents that are expensive and are often highly flammable, thus requiring specialized equipment for containment, fireproofing, explosion proofing and disposal. Accordingly, it is desirable not to use such solvents, particularly when purifying large amounts of protein.
      The use of harsh organic solvents can also require specialized equipment that does not degrade or corrode during the extraction process. Alternatively, the equipment used in the extraction method must be replaced regularly due to degradation/corrosion.
      Some methods for extracting protein from microorganisms also make use of enzymes, such as lysozyme. However, these methods are difficult to use to extract proteins from large amount of cells because the lysozyme addition is inefficient and it is difficult to disperse the enzyme throughout a large pellet of cells.
      It will be apparent to the skilled artisan from the foregoing that methods that permit extraction of a protein from a microorganism and reduce the level of contamination by nucleic acids and/or lipids and/or endotoxins and/or other cell proteins from the cell are desirable. Desirably, the method permits the protein to be extracted in soluble form, while contaminants are precipitated.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      The present disclosure is based on the inventor's development of a method that enabled extraction of proteins, e.g., soluble proteins from microorganisms, in which the proteins remained soluble while a considerable amount of the endogenous proteins, nucleic acid and/or lipids from the microorganism precipitated. The method enabled the inventor to extract the soluble proteins at a higher purity than some other methods, while extracting similar levels of protein to those methods. Thus, the method produced by the inventor facilitates downstream purification steps by recovering a high yield of protein with a reduced level of contamination. As exemplified herein, the inventor has used multiple carboxylic acids to extract soluble proteins from bacteria, e.g., Escherichia coli. These results are used as a model for microorganisms generally.
      In one example, the inventor has extracted soluble protein at a high level of purity using a sufficiently low concentration of a carboxylic acid (e.g., less than about 50% of a carboxylic acid) that the method could be performed with standard equipment. Some examples of the method produced by the inventor permit the extracted protein to be applied directly to a filter, e.g., a filtration membrane commonly used in tangential flow filtration or depth filtration without the need for adding a buffer to reduce the risk of damaging the filter. The inventor also found that increasing concentrations of a carboxylic acid (e.g., acetic acid) above about 37% or 50% or 62% reduced the purity of the protein, e.g., to a level less than that when the protein was extracted with about 25% of the acid. In this regard, using a solution comprising about 25% of a carboxylic acid resulted in a high level of purity. Extraction using a solution comprising carboxylic acid at 100% resulted in sufficiently pure protein for further purification, however the protein was not as pure as the protein extracted with a solution comprising a carboxylic acid at about 25%.
      In another example, the inventor found that extracting the protein using between about 25% to about 100% of a carboxylic acid for more than about, e.g., 20 minutes or 30 minutes had little effect on the amount of protein extracted. Thus, the inventor has determined that extraction can be performed in a relatively short period of time (if desired).
      As will be apparent from the foregoing, the inventor has demonstrated soluble protein can be extracted with a carboxylic acid which is inexpensive and which do not require specialized equipment for processing, storage and/or disposal. An exemplary carboxylic acid used by the inventor is acetic acid.
      The inventor has shown that this method is effective across a wide range of concentrations of a carboxylic acid. The inventor has also shown that the amount of protein extracted and/or the purity of the extracted protein can be improved by increasing the ratio of the volume of acid to the weight of microorganisms.
      The methods produced by the inventor do not necessarily require specialized equipment, e.g., homogenizers or sonicators, or harsh organic solvents or enzymes, such as lysozyme, to extract soluble protein.
      The findings by the inventor provides the basis for methods for extracting soluble proteins from microorganisms, as well as methods for purifying proteins for use in humans or non-human animals.
      Based on the foregoing discussion, the present disclosure provides a method for extracting a soluble protein from a population of microorganisms, the method comprising contacting the population of microorganisms expressing the soluble protein with a solution comprising an amount of a carboxylic acid effective to extract the soluble protein from the population of microorganisms.
      In one example, the carboxylic acid is acetic acid.
      In one example, the population of microorganisms is contacted with the solution for a time sufficient to extract the soluble proteins. For example, the population of microorganisms is contacted for less than about 48 hours or 24 hours or 20 hours, e.g., less than about 12 hours, such as less than about 8 hours or 6 hours. For example, the population of microorganisms is contacted for less than about 2 hours or 1 hour, e.g., for between about 20 minutes and 1 hour.
      The present disclosure provides a method for extracting a soluble protein from a population of microorganisms, the method comprising contacting the population of microorganism expressing the soluble protein with an amount of a solution comprising from about 1% (v/v) to about 100% (v/v) carboxylic acid effective to extract the soluble protein from the population of microorganisms. For example, the solution comprises between about 1% and about 90% or 80% or 70% or 60% or 50% carboxylic acid. For example, the solution comprises between about 10% and about 90% or 80% or 70% or 60% or 50% carboxylic acid. For example, the solution comprises between about 20% and about 90% or 80% or 70% or 60% or 50% carboxylic acid. In some examples, the method comprises contacting the population with such a solution for a specified period of time (e.g., 1 hour or less) as described herein.
      The present disclosure provides a method for extracting a soluble protein from a population of microorganisms, the method comprising contacting the population of microorganism expressing the soluble protein with an amount of a solution comprising from about 1% (v/v) to less than 50% (v/v) carboxylic acid effective to extract the soluble protein from the population of microorganisms.
      In one example, the solution comprises from about 1% (v/v) to about 40% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      In one example, the solution comprises from about 1% (v/v) to about 37.5% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      In one example, the solution comprises from about 1% (v/v) to about 30% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      In one example, the solution comprises from about 1% (v/v) to about 25% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      For example, the solution comprises from about 10% (v/v) to about 40% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      For example, the solution comprises from about 10% (v/v) to about 37.5% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      For example, the solution comprises from about 10% (v/v) to about 25% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      For example, the solution comprises from about 20% (v/v) to about 40% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      For example, the solution comprises from about 20% (v/v) to about 37.5% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      For example, the solution comprises from about 25% (v/v) to about 37.5% (v/v) carboxylic acid.
      Additional amounts of acetic acid are described herein and are to be taken to apply mutatis mutandis to the present example of the disclosure.
      Using a solution comprising 40% or 37.5% or 25% or less carboxylic acid facilitates downstream purification with fewer steps and/or reduced cost. This is because several filters used for processing extracted protein, e.g., by tangential flow filtration, can be damaged by levels of carboxylic acid, e.g., acetic acid, greater than 40% or 37.5% or 25%. Exemplary filters damaged by these conditions comprise or consist of reconstituted cellulose or polyethersulfone.
      The present disclosure also provides a method for extracting a soluble protein from a population of microorganisms, the method comprising contacting the population of microorganism expressing the soluble protein with an amount of a solution comprising a carboxylic acid effective to extract the soluble protein from the population of microorganisms for less than about 20 hours or 15 hours or 10 hours or 5 hours or 4 hours or 3 hours or 2 hours or 1 hour. In one example, the population of microorganism is contacted with the solution for less than about 1 hour, e.g., between about 10 minutes and about 1 hour. In one example, the population of microorganism is contacted with the solution for between about 20 minutes and about 1 hour.
      Additional times of extraction are described herein and are to be taken to apply mutatis mutandis to the present example of the disclosure.
      In one example, the solution comprises between about 10% and about 100% of carboxylic acid, e.g., between about 10% and 90% or 80% or 75% or 70% or an amount described herein.
      In one example of a method of the present disclosure the carboxylic acid is added at a dissolution ratio from about 1:1 (milliliters of acid:grams of microorganism (wet)) to about 20:1 (milliliters of acid:grams of microorganism (wet)). For example, the carboxylic acid is added at a dissolution ratio from about 5:1 (milliliters of acid:grams of microorganism (wet)) to about 20:1 (milliliters of acid:grams of microorganism (wet)), such as to about 10:1 (milliliters of acid:grams of microorganism (wet)). In one exemplary form of the disclosure, the carboxylic acid is added at a dissolution ratio of about 9:1 (milliliters of acid:grams of microorganism (wet)).
      In one example, the carboxylic acid is added to microorganisms that are not suspended in a solution, such as cell culture medium. For example, the microorganisms have been sedimented by centrifugation.
      In one example, carboxylic acid is added to a solution comprising microorganisms, e.g., a cell culture medium or other solution, such that it comprises from about 1% (v/v) to less than 50% (v/v) carboxylic acid
      Carboxylic acids will be apparent to the skilled artisan. Exemplary carboxylic acids are listed in Table 1.
      In one example, the carboxylic acid has a pKa of at least about 3. As exemplified herein, suitable carboxylic acids include acetic acid or formic acid. The inventor has shown that acetic acid is useful for extracting soluble protein with a higher recovery and/or level of purity than urea or sodium hydroxide or isopropanol.
      In one example and as appropriate, a method described herein according to any example comprises contacting the population of microorganisms with the solution for about five hours or less, such as four hours or less, for example 3 hours or less or two hours or less. In one example, the method comprises contacting the population of microorganisms with the solution for about 1 hour or less. The skilled artisan will understand that this method requires actual contacting of the population with the acid. Thus, the term “or less” means at least 1 minute, e.g., at least 5 or 10 or 15 minutes.
      In one example, the method additionally comprises contacting the population of microorganisms with a detergent, such as Tween (polyoxyethylene-sorbitan monooleate, e.g., Tween 20 or Tween 80) or a detergent from the TritonX class of detergents (polyethylene glycol p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenyl ether). In one example, the detergent is added with the carboxylic acid. In one example, the detergent is added after the carboxylic acid. In one example, the detergent is added before the carboxylic acid.
      In one example, the soluble protein is recombinantly expressed by the population of microorganisms.
      Exemplary microorganisms include bacteria, yeast or fungi. Exemplary microorganisms include bacteria, such as Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli.
      In one example, the soluble protein has a pI that permits the protein to remain soluble when the protein is extracted from the population of microorganisms. In one example, the protein has a neutral pI, e.g., from about 6 to about 8, e.g., from about 6.5 to about 7.5.

      In one example, protein is selected from the group consisting of a scleroprotein, a chaperonin, a heat shock protein, a peptide (e.g., a natriuretic peptide) and a protein comprising a variable domain of an antibody.
      In one example, the protein is a fusion protein. For example, the protein comprises multiple copies (e.g., two or three copies) of a peptide or polypeptide. In another example, the protein comprises two polypeptides fused to one another, e.g., a peptide or polypeptide fused to a tag to facilitate purification (e.g., a hexa-histidine tag) or a Fc region of an antibody (e.g., an IgG1 antibody).
      In one example, the method additionally comprises removing a solution comprising the soluble protein from insoluble components of the population of microorganisms.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002462512,"BACKGROUND
      Epigenetics concerns the transmission of information from a cell or multicellular organism to its descendants without that information being encoded in the nucleotide sequence of genes. Epigenetic controls are typically established via chemical modification of the DNA or chromatin structure. Gene expression can be moderated, for example, via the methylation and acetylation of histones that are associated with the genomic DNA. Methylation and acetylation of histones tends to occur in the histone tail, a domain that is surface exposed and has a net positive charge due to an abundance of amino acid residues such as arginine (R) and lysine (K). The chemical modification of the histone tail is moderated by enzymes having a histone methyltransferase activity (HMTases) and histone acetyltransferase activity (HATs).
      Epigenetic modifications can occur at different times in the normal development of an organism, and also during transformation of normal cells into cancerous cells. Such modifications often result in the silencing or activation of certain genes. In cancer, it is well documented that the majority of tumour cells display abnormal DNA epigenetic imprints (Feinberg A P & Vogelstein B, (1983) Nature 1(5895):89-92).
      Stem cells are cells that are able to both extensively self-renew and differentiate into progenitors. As such, stem cells are also potential candidates for the origin of cancers. Stem cells can have a long lifespan in which they acquire genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications that can increase the tendency toward malignancy. It is postulated that since stem cells occupy a niche that is so finely balanced between the competing interests of proliferation and differentiation, small but profound epigenetic changes can tip the balance towards a cancer stem cell phenotype. An appreciation of why and how epigenetic modifications are regulated is critical to the understanding, detection and treatment of cancer and particularly the treatment of cancer stem cells. Indeed, it is believed that one of the factors present in cases of recurrent and aggressive cancers that are difficult to treat is that the tumours may contain cancer stem cells that do not respond to conventional therapies.
      Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is used to generate animals for livestock production (for cloning or for stem cell therapy), biomanufacturing of proteins and for disease modelling (Wilmut I, Beaujean N, de Sousa P A, Dinnyes A, King T J, Paterson L A, Wells D N, Young L E. (2002) Nature. October 10; 419(6907):583-6). One of the problems associated with the efficiency and success rates obtained for SCNT is that the somatic cell genome comprises extensive and stable epigenetic marks that can hinder successful reprogramming. In addition, the recipient egg cell can comprise factors that exert epigenetic effects that can also contribute to the failure of the procedure. Hence, there is a need to provide compositions and methods to improve the efficiency of SCNT and, thus, the bioprocessing applications that are facilitated by this procedure.
      The specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in the mouse has provided an attractive experimental model for analysing the effects of epigenetic modifications in vivo. A founder population of about 45 PGCs is first detected at E7.5 in mouse embryos (Ginsburg, M., Snow, M. H. & McLaren, A. (1990) Development 110, 521-8). Thereafter, these PGCs migrate and enter the genital ridges from E10.5 onwards, where further extensive epigenetic programming of germ cells continues. By E13.5, germ cells enter into meiotic prophase in the female and mitotic arrest in the male gonad.
      Significant epigenetic modifications ensue immediately after the specification of PGCs, including methylation and acetylation of histone tails by HMTases and HATs, respectively (Surani et al., 2004 (CSH Symposium); Seki et al., 2004; Lachner, M., O'Sullivan, R. J. & Jenuwein, T. (2003) J Cell Sci 116, 2117-24, and Vaquero, A., Loyola, A. & Reinberg, D. (2003) Sci Aging Knowledge Environ 2003, RE4). Among the candidate genes postulated to have a role in regulating these epigenetic changes in PGCs are the HMTases that belong to the conserved SET/PR domain protein family.
      Hence, there is a need to provide reagents and methods for improving the control of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms within the cell. In particular, there is a need for compositions and methods that allow for greater control of gene expression so as to influence cell fate decisions in stem cells and in cancer cells.

      In a specific embodiment of the invention, the control of gene expression results in the control of expression of one of more of the genes selected from the group consisting of c-Myc; Dhx38; Pcdh7; Q8C9T7; Xylt1; DnaH1; Baip2; Nek7; Dusp2; ENSMUSG0000027041; Sirt4; and Blimp1. The induction of the polypeptide complex in the cell can lead to a reduction in expression of one or more of these genes.
      A fourth aspect of the invention provides a method for promoting self renewal and inhibiting differentiation within a stem cell comprising inhibiting the formation of a Blimp1/Prmt5 complex within the stem cell. Optionally the stem cell is a mammalian stem cell, suitably a human stem cell. In particular embodiments of the invention the stem cell is selected from the group consisting of an adult stem cell; a stem cell progenitor; and a pluripotent stem cell. It will be appreciated that the invention is in no way directed at reproductive cloning of humans or the manipulation and use of human embryos for the purpose of facilitating human reproductive cloning.
      In a specific embodiment of this aspect of the invention, inhibition of the formation of a Blimp1/Prmt5 complex within the stem cell is achieved by exposing the cell to a Blimp1 inhibitor compound, a Prmt5 inhibitor compound and/or a Blimp1/Prmt5 complex inhibitor compound. Suitably, the inhibitor compound can be selected from a small molecule inhibitor; a siRNA molecule that binds to Blimp1 or Prmt5 mRNA; an antisense oligonucleotide that binds to Blimp1 or Prmt5 mRNA; and a dominant negative version of the Blimp1 or Prmt5 polypeptide.

The Blimp1 induced within the cell can be either exogenous Blimp1 or endogenous Blimp1. Suitably, the cell can be a mammalian stem cell.
      Still further aspects of the invention provide for uses of the polypeptide complexes of the invention in the treatment of cancer, and to cells—suitably mammalian/human cells—comprising the expression vector constructs described above.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200802332,"BACKGROUND
      The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by a better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is protein kinases.
      Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell. (Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.: 1995). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases may be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these kinase families (See, for example, Hanks, S. K., Hunter, T., FASEB J. 1995, 9, 576-596; Knighton et al., Science 1991, 253, 407-414; Hiles et al., Cell 1992, 70, 419-429; Kunz et al., Cell 1993, 73, 585-596; Garcia-Bustos et al., EMBO J. 1994, 13, 2352-2361).
      In general, protein kinases mediate intracellular signaling by affecting a phosphoryl transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved in a signaling pathway. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. These phosphorylation events are ultimately triggered in response to a variety of extracellular and other stimuli. Examples of such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat shock, ultraviolet radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and H 2O 2), cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)), and growth factors (e.g., granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An extracellular stimulus may affect one or more cellular responses related to cell growth, migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.
      Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events as described above. These diseases include, but are not limited to, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents.
      The Janus kinases (JAK) are a family of tyrosine kinases consisting of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. The JAKs play a critical role in cytokine signaling. The down-stream substrates of the JAK family of kinases include the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lymphomas. The pharmaceutical intervention in the JAK/STAT pathway has been reviewed [Frank Mol. Med. 5: 432-456 (1999) & Seidel, et al, Oncogene 19: 2645-2656 (2000)].
      JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed, while JAK3 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells. JAK3 binds exclusively to the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (γ c) and is activated by IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. The proliferation and survival of murine mast cells induced by IL-4 and IL-9 have, in fact, been shown to be dependent on JAK3- and 65 c-signaling [Suzuki et al, Blood 96: 2172-2180 (2000)].
      Cross-linking of the high-affinity immunoglobulin (Ig) E receptors of sensitized mast cells leads to a release of proinflammatory mediators, including a number of vasoactive cytokines resulting in acute allergic, or immediate (type I) hypersensitivity reactions [Gordon et al, Nature 346: 274-276 (1990) & Galli, N. Engl. J. Med., 328: 257-265 (1993)]. A crucial role for JAK3 in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell responses in vitro and in vivo has been established [Malaviya, et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257: 807-813 (1999)]. In addition, the prevention of type I hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, mediated by mast cell-activation through inhibition of JAK3 has also been reported [Malaviya et al, J. Biol. Chem. 274:27028-27038 (1999)].
      The JAK family of tyrosine kinases have also been shown to play a role in immunosuppression and allograft acceptance [Kirken, Transpl. Proc. 33: 3268-3270 (2001)], rheumatoid arthritis [Muller-Ladner, et al., J. Immunol. 164: 3894-3901 (2000)], Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [Trieu, et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 267: 22-25 (2000)], and leukemia [Sudbeck, et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 5: 1569-1582 (1999)].
      Initiation, progression, and completion of the mammalian cell cycle are regulated by various cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, which are critical for cell growth. These complexes comprise at least a catalytic (the CDK itself) and a regulatory (cyclin) subunit. Some of the more important complexes for cell cycle regulation include cyclin A (CDK1—also known as cdc2, and CDK2), cyclin B1-B3 (CDK1) and cyclin D1-D3 (CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6), cyclin E (CDK2). Each of these complexes is involved in a particular phase of the cell cycle. Not all members of the CDK family are involved exclusively in cell cycle control, however. Thus CDKs 7, 8, and 9 are implicated in the regulation of transcription, and CDK5 plays a role in neuronal and secretory cell function.
      The activity of CDKs is regulated post-translationally, by transitory associations with other proteins, and by alterations of their intracellular localization. Tumor development is closely associated with genetic alteration and deregulation of CDKs and their regulators, suggesting that inhibitors of CDKs may be useful anti-cancer therapeutics. Indeed, early results suggest that transformed and normal cells differ in their requirement for, e.g., cyclin A/CDK2 and that it may be possible to develop novel antineoplastic agents devoid of the general host toxicity observed with conventional cytotoxic and cytostatic drugs. While inhibition of cell cycle-related CDKs is clearly relevant in, e.g., oncology applications, this may not be the case for the inhibition of RNA polymerase-regulating CDKs. On the other hand, inhibition of CDK9/cyclin T function was recently linked to prevention of HIV replication and the discovery of new CDK biology thus continues to open up new therapeutic indications for CDK inhibitors (Sausville, E. A. Trends Molec. Med. 2002, 8, S32-S37).
      The function of CDKs is to phosphorylate and thus activate or deactivate certain proteins, including e.g. retinoblastoma proteins, lamins, histone H1, and components of the mitotic spindle. The catalytic step mediated by CDKs involves a phospho-transfer reaction from ATP to the macromolecular enzyme substrate. Several groups of compounds (reviewed in e.g. Fischer, P. M. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2001, 4, 623-634) have been found to possess anti-proliferative properties by virtue of CDK-specific ATP antagonism.
      Thus, there is a continued need to find new therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. Accordingly, there is a great need to develop inhibitors of protein kinases, such as Jak1, Jak2 and Jak3, as well as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8 and CDK9.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
200700404,"BACKGROUND
       Incubation of proteins or lipids with aldose sugars results in nonenzymatic glycation and oxidation of amino groups on proteins to form Amadori adducts. Over time, the adducts undergo additional rearrangements, dehydrations, and cross-linking with other proteins to form complexes known as Advanced Glycosylation End Products (AGEs). Factors which promote formation of AGEs include delayed protein turnover (e.g. as in amyloidoses), accumulation of macromolecules having high lysine content, and high blood glucose levels (e.g. as in diabetes) (Hori et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270: 25752-761, (1995)). AGEs have been implicated in a variety of disorders including complications associated with diabetes and normal aging.
       AGEs display specific and saturable binding to cell surface receptors on monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells of the microvasculature, smooth muscle cells, mesengial cells, and neurons. The Receptor for Advanced Glycated Endproducts (RAGE) is a member of the immumoglobulin supergene family of molecules. The extracellular (N-terminal) domain of RAGE includes three immunoglobulin-type regions: one V (variable) type domain followed by two C-type (constant) domains (Neeper et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:14998-15004 (1992); Schmidt et al., Circ. ( Suppl.) 96#194 (1997)). A single transmembrane spanning domain and a short, highly charged cytosolic tail follow the extracellular domain. The N-terminal, extracellular domain can be isolated by proteolysis of RAGE or by molecular biological approaches to generate soluble RAGE (sRAGE) comprised of the V and C domains.
       RAGE is expressed on multiple cell types including leukocytes, neurons, microglial cells and vascular endothelium (e.g., Hori et al., J. Biol. Chem., 270:25752-761 (1995)). Increased levels of RAGE are also found in aging tissues (Schleicher et al., J. Clin. Invest., 99 (3): 457-468 (1997)), and the diabetic retina, vasculature and kidney (Schmidt et al., Nature Med., 1: 1002-1004 (1995)).
       In addition to AGEs, other compounds can bind to and modulate RAGE. RAGE binds to multiple functionally and structurally diverse ligands including amyloid beta (Aβ), serum amyloid A (SAA), Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs), S100 (a proinflammatory member of the Calgranulin family), carboxymethyl lysine (CML), amphoterin and CD11b/CD18 (Bucciarelli et al., Cell Mol. Life Sci., 59:1117-128 (2002); Chavakis et al., Microbes Infect., 6:1219-1225 (2004); Kokkola et al., Scand. J. Immunol., 61:1-9 (2005); Schmidt et al., J. Clin. Invest., 108:949-955 (2001); Rocken et al., Am. J. Pathol., 162:1213-1220 (2003)).
       Binding of ligands such as AGEs, S100/calgranulin, β-amyloid, CML (N ε-Carboxymethyl lysine), and amphoterin to RAGE has been shown to modify expression of a variety of genes. These interactions may then initiate signal transduction mechanisms including p38 activation, p21ras, MAP kinases, Erk1-2 phosphorylation, and the activation of the transcriptional mediator of inflammatory signaling, NF-κB (Yeh et al., Diabetes, 50:1495-1504 (2001)). For example, in many cell types, interaction between RAGE and its ligands can generate oxidative stress, which thereby results in activation of the free radical sensitive transcription factor NF-κB, and the activation of NF-κB regulated genes, such as the cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α. Furthermore, RAGE expression is upregulated via NF-κB and shows increased expression at sites of inflammation or oxidative stress (Tanaka et al., J. Biol. Chem., 275:25781-25790 (2000)). Thus, an ascending and often detrimental spiral may be fueled by a positive feedback loop initiated by ligand binding.
       Activation of RAGE in different tissues and organs can lead to a number of pathophysiological consequences. RAGE has been implicated in a variety of conditions including: acute and chronic inflammation (Hofmann et al., Cell 97:889-901 (1999)), the development of diabetic late complications such as increased vascular permeability (Wautier et al., J. Clin. Invest., 97:238-243 (1995)), nephropathy (Teillet et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 11: 1488-1497 (2000)), arteriosclerosis (Vlassara et. al., The Finnish Medical Society DUODECIM, Ann. Med., 28:419-426 (1996)), and retinopathy (Hammes et al., Diabetologia, 42:603-607 (1999)). RAGE has also been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (Yan et al., Nature, 382:685-691 (1996)), and in tumor invasion and metastasis (Taguchi et al., Nature, 405:354-357 (2000)).
       Despite the broad expression of RAGE and its apparent pleiotropic role in multiple diverse disease models, RAGE does not appear to be essential to normal development. For example, RAGE knockout mice are without an overt abnormal phenotype, suggesting that while RAGE can play a role in disease pathology when stimulated chronically, inhibition of RAGE does not appear to contribute to any unwanted acute phenotype (Liliensiek et al., J. Clin. Invest., 113:1641-50 (2004)).
       Antagonizing binding of physiological ligands to RAGE may down-regulate the pathophysiological changes brought about by excessive concentrations of AGEs and other RAGE ligands. By reducing binding of endogenous ligands to RAGE, symptoms associated with RAGE-mediated disorders may be reduced. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) is able to effectively antagonize the binding of RAGE ligands to RAGE. However, sRAGE can have a half-life when administered in vivo that may be too short to be therapeutically useful for one or more disorders. Thus, there is a need to develop compounds that antagonize the binding of AGEs and other physiological ligands to the RAGE receptor where the compound has a desireable pharmacokinetic profile.

Alternatively, a nucleic acid construct encoding the fusion protein may be delivered to a site by the use of an appropriate carrier such as a virus or naked DNA where transient local expression may locally inhibit the interaction between RAGE ligands and receptors. Thus, administration may be transient (e.g., as where the fusion protein is administered) or more permanent in nature (e.g., as where the fusion protein is administered as a recombinant DNA).
       There are additional features of the invention which will be described hereinafter. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following claims, description and figures. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or carried out in various ways.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
200700402,"BACKGROUND
       The capillaries that supply blood to the tissues of the brain constitute the blood brain barrier (Goldstein et al. (1986) Scientific American 255: 74-83; Pardridge, W. M. (1986) Endocrin. Rev. 7: 314-330). The endothelial cells which form the brain capillaries are different from those found in other tissues in the body. Brain capillary endothelial cells are joined together by tight intercellular junctions which form a continuous wall against the passive diffusion of molecules from the blood to the brain and other parts of the central nervous system (CNS). These cells are also different in that they have few pinocytic vesicles which in other tissues allow somewhat unselective transport across the capillary wall. Also lacking are continuous gaps or channels running between the cells which would allow unrestricted passage.
       The blood-brain barrier functions to ensure that the environment of the brain is constantly controlled. The levels of various substances in the blood, such as hormones, amino acids and ions, undergo frequent small fluctuations which can be brought about by activities such as eating and exercise (Goldstein et al., cited supra). If the brain was not protected by the blood brain barrier from these variations in serum composition, the result could be uncontrolled neural activity.
       The isolation of the brain from the bloodstream is not complete. If this were the case, the brain would be unable to function properly due to a lack of nutrients and because of the need to exchange chemicals with the rest of the body. The presence of specific transport systems within the capillary endothelial cells assures that the brain receives, in a controlled manner, all of the compounds required for normal growth and function. In many instances, these transport systems consist of membrane-associated proteins which selectively bind and certain molecules across the barrier membranes. These transporter proteins are known as solute carrier transporters.
       The problem posed by the blood-brain barrier is that, in the process of protecting the brain, it excludes many potentially useful therapeutic agents. Presently, only substances which are sufficiently lipophilic can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (Goldstein et al., cited supra; Pardridge, W. M., cited supra). Some drugs can be modified to make them more lipophilic and thereby increase their ability to cross the blood brain barrier. However, each modification must be tested individually on each drug and the modification can alter the activity of the drug.
       Because the blood brain barrier is composed of brain microvessel endothelial cells, these cells have been isolated and cultured for use in in vitro model systems for studying the blood brain barrier (Bowman et. al, Brain microvessel endothelial cells in tissue culture: A model for study of blood-brain barrier permeability, Ann. Neurol. 14, 396-402 (1983); Audus and Borchardt, Characterization of an in vitro blood-brain barrier model system for studying drug transport and metabolism, Pharm, Res. 3, 81-87 (1986)). In vitro model systems of the blood brain barrier have been successfully derived from bovine, canine, human, murine, porcine, and rat cells, and have similar permeability properties due to similarity of the physiological characteristics of the blood brain barrier among mammals (Cserr et al., Blood-brain interfaces in vertebrates: a comparative approach, Am. J. Physiol. 246, R277-R288 (1984); Audus et al., The use of cultured epithelial and endothelial cells for drug transport and metabolism studies, Pharm. Res. 7, 435-451 (1990)). In these models, the cultured endothelial cells retain the characteristics of brain endothelial cells in vivo, such as morphology, specific blood brain barrier enzyme markers, and tight intercellular junctions. The cells can also be used for the study of passive diffusion, carrier mediated transport, and metabolism to specific factors affecting the blood brain barrier permeability. However, passaging of brain microvessel endothelial cells results in loss of specific endothelial and blood brain barrier markers as well as tight intercellular junctions (Brightman and Neuwelt (ed.), Implications of the blood-brain barrier and its manipulation, Vol. 1, Plenum Medical, New York, pp. 53-83 (1989)).
       Currently, primary cultures of brain microvessel endothelial cells are the principal tool for in vitro prediction of blood brain barrier permeability. Isolated and cultured primary brain cells developed previously have exhibited different properties primarily due to considerable variability in the starting material. For example, with respect to transcellular transport, rigorous comparison of data between different laboratories has been very difficult (Pardridge et al., Comparison of in vitro and in vivo models of drug transcytosis through the blood-brain barrier, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Thera. 253, 884-891 (1990); Masereeuw et al., In vitro and in vivo transport of zidovudine (AZT) across the blood-brain barrier and the effect of transport inhibitors. Pharm. Res., 11, 324-330 (1994)). Passaging primary cells can affect the differentiation of cells and lead to the selection of the most rapidly proliferating clones. Furthermore, the expression of some marker enzymes such as gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase as well as tight junctional complexity has been shown to decrease with time in culture and passage number (Meresse et. al., Bovine brain endothelial cells express tight junctions and monoamine oxidase activity in long-term culture, J. Neuorchem. 53, 1363-1371 (1989)). Some transporter substrates have been demonstrated to accumulate in the brain (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,489,302).
       Thus, it is apparent that the presently available clones of immortalized brain microvessel endothelial cell cultures suffer from individual drawbacks in terms of phenotype expression and homogeneic maintenance of that expression. This leads to difficulties with respect to accuracy and reproducibility in studies utilizing brain microvessel endothelial cells to model passage of chemical compounds and moieties, e.g., potential therapeutic compounds and/or drug moieties, across the blood brain barrier.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
       Disclosed herein are methods of screening agents, conjugates or conjugate moieties for the ability to enter the CNS by crossing the blood brain barrier in order to treat or diagnose conditions within the CNS. These methods entail providing a cell expressing an OATPB transporter, the transporter being situated in the plasma membrane of the cell. The cell is contacted with an agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety. Whether the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety passes through the plasma membrane via the OATPB transporter is determined. If the method comprises contacting the cell with an agent, the agent is a neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component. If the method comprises contacting the cell with a conjugate, the conjugate comprises an agent that is a neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component. If the method comprises contacting the cells with a conjugate moiety, the method further comprises linking the conjugate moiety to an agent that is a neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component.
       In some methods, the cell endogenously expresses an OATPB transporter. In other methods a nucleic acid molecule encoding an OATPB transporter has been transfected or injected into the cell. In some methods the cell is a brain microvessel endothelial cell. In other methods the cell is an oocyte. In other methods the cell is a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell. In other methods the cell is a Madin Darby canine kidney cell (MDCK). In still other methods, the cell is constructed to conditionally express the transporter.
       In some methods the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety comprises a xenobiotic molecule containing one or more ring structures and one or more anionic groups such as carboxylates and sulfates. In some methods the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety is administered to an undiseased animal and any toxic effects are determined. In some methods the neuropharmaceutical agent is a cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent selected from the group consisting of platinum, nitrosourea, a phosphoramide group that is selectively cytotoxic to brain tumor cells, nitroimidizole, and nitrogen mustard.
       Disclosed herein are methods of screening agents, conjugates or conjugate moieties for the ability to enter the CNS by crossing the blood brain barrier wherein a cell used for testing is a brain microvessel endothelial cell that is one of a plurality of brain microvessel endothelial cells forming a polarized monolayer. An agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety is contacted to one side of the polarized monolayer and whether the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety is transported into the brain microvessel endothelial cells or to the opposite side of the polarized monolayer is determined. Some methods further comprise administering the agent, conjugate, or conjugate moiety to a peripheral tissue of an animal and measuring the amount of agent, conjugate, or conjugate moiety that passes through the blood brain barrier into the brain of the animal.
       Disclosed herein are methods of screening an agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety for neuropharmacological activity useful for treating neurological disorders. In these methods, one determines whether the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety is transported through an OATPB transporter. One then administers the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety to a test animal and determines whether the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety is actively transported across the blood brain barrier by measuring agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety concentrations found in the CNS of the animal. For those agents, conjugates or conjugate moieties that are transported in sufficient quantities, the agents, conjugates or conjugate moieties can be further tested in animals suffering from a particular neurological disorder to determine whether the agents, conjugates or conjugate moieties have the requisite therapeutic neuropharmacological activity for treating such neurological disorder.
       Also disclosed herein are methods for in vitro screening of agents, conjugates or conjugate moieties for improved retention in the CNS. In these methods, one determines the substrate properties of a compound on both uptake transporters and efflux transporters. An agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety is first tested for activity on the OATPB transporter. The agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety is then tested for substrate activity on an efflux transporter, such as P Glycoprotein (PgP). Those agents, conjugates or conjugate moieties active on both the efflux transporter and OATPB are then modified and tested for a reduction of efflux substrate activity and retested for retention of activity on the OATPB transporter. This iterative process produces an agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety with an increased ratio of substrate activities in the uptake and efflux systems, and improved retention of pharmacological levels of the modified agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety in the CNS.
       Disclosed herein are methods of screening an agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety for capacity to be transported into the brain, comprising determining whether the agent, conjugate or conjugate moiety specifically binds to an OATPB transporter, contacting the agent to one side of a polarized monolayer of cells, and determining whether the agent is actively transported across the polarized monolayer. In some methods the specific binding is determined by contacting a cell expressing the OATPB transporter, the transporter being situated in the plasma membrane of the cell, with a substrate of the OATPB transporter, and determining whether the agent inhibits transport of the substrate across the polarized monolayer.
       Disclosed herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, a cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component linked to a conjugate moiety to form a conjugate in which the conjugate moiety has a higher V max for the OATPB transporter than the therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or imaging component alone. Some pharmaceutical compositions have at least 5 times the V max for OATPB than the neuropharmaceutical agent or the imaging component alone. In some pharmaceutical compositions the conjugate has a V max for OATPB that is at least 5% of the V max for OATPB of a compound selected from the group comprising estrone-3-sulfate, bromosulfophthalein and pravastatin. In some pharmaceutical compositions the conjugate has a lower V max for an efflux transporter than the neuropharmaceutical agent or the imaging component alone.
       Disclosed herein are methods of formulating a therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, a cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component. These methods entail linking the therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, the cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or the imaging component to a conjugate moiety to form a conjugate, wherein the conjugate moiety has a greater V max for an OATPB transporter than the component alone. The conjugate is formulated with a pharmaceutical carrier as a pharmaceutical composition.
       Disclosed herein are methods of delivering a therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, a cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component. The methods involve administering to a patient a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, a cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component linked to a conjugate moiety to form a conjugate, wherein the conjugate has a higher V max for an OATPB transporter than the therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or imaging component alone, whereby the conjugate passes through brain microvessel endothelial cells which make up the blood brain barrier, via the OATPB transporter, into the CNS of the patient. Also disclosed herein are methods of delivering a conjugate, comprising administering to a patient a pharmaceutical composition comprising a neuropharmaceutical agent or imaging component linked to a conjugate moiety to form the conjugate, wherein the conjugate has a higher V max for an OATPB transporter than the neuropharmaceutical agent or imaging component alone. In some methods the V max of the conjugate is at least two-fold higher than that of the neuropharmaceutical agent or imaging component alone. In some methods the neuropharmaceutical agent is a cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical selected from the group consisting of platinum, nitrosourea, a phosphoramide group selectively cytotoxic to brain tumor cells, nitroimidizole, and nitrogen mustard.
       Disclosed herein are methods of treating neurological disorders. These methods entail administering to a patient an effective amount of an agent that is transported by OATPB, wherein the agent is a conjugate comprising a therapeutic neuropharmaceutical agent, a cytotoxic neuropharmaceutical agent or an imaging component linked to a conjugate moiety.
       Disclosed herein are methods of screening an agent for decreased side effects in the central nervous system (CNS), comprising providing an agent having a pharmacological activity, wherein the pharmacological activity is useful for treating a disease present in a tissue other than the CNS, and the pharmacological activity results in undesired side effects in the CNS if the agent enters the CNS, modifying the agent, providing a cell expressing at least one efflux transporter protein that transports substrates out of the CNS, contacting the cell with the modified agent, and determining whether the modified agent is transported by the at least one efflux transporter protein with a higher V max than the agent, a higher V max indicating that the modification increases the capacity of the modified agent relative to the agent to be transported out of the CNS, thereby decreasing undesired side effects in the CNS.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002751847,"BACKGROUND
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion encoding an abnormally long polyglutamine (PolyQ) tract in the huntingtin protein. The Huntington disease gene was first mapped in 1993 (The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Group. Cell. 1993, 72:971-83), consisting of a gene, IT15, which contained a polymorphic trinucleotide repeat that is expanded and unstable on HD chromosomes. Although CAG repeats in the normal size range are usually inherited as Mendelian alleles, expanded HD repeats are unstable through meiotic transmission and are found to be expanded beyond the normal size range (6-34 repeat units) in HD patients.
      Both normal and variant huntingtin protein are localized chiefly in the cytoplasm of neurons (DiFiglia et al., Neuron 1995, 14:1075-81). As a result of excessive polyglutamine length, huntingtin protein forms aggregates in the cytoplasm and nucleus of CNS neurons (Davies et al., Cell 1997, 90:537-548). Both transgenic animals and genetically modified cell lines have been used to investigate the effects of expanded polyQ repeats on the localization and processing of huntingtin. However, it is still unclear whether the formation of aggregates per se is the essential cytotoxic step or a consequence of cellular dysfunction.
      HD is characterized by progressive chorea, psychiatric changes and intellectual decline. This dominant disorder affects males and females equally, and occurs in all races (Gusella and MacDonald, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995 5:656-62). Symptoms of HD are due to the death of neurons in many brain regions, but is most apparent in the striatum, particularly in the caudate nucleus, which suffers a progressive gradient of cell loss that ultimately decimates the entire structure. Although the gene encoding huntingtin is expressed ubiquitously (Strong, T. V. et al., Nat. Genet. 1995, 5:259-263), selective cell loss and fibrillary astrocytosis is observed in the brain, particularly in the caudate and putamen of the striatum and in the cerebral cortex of HD patients (Vonsattel, J-P. et al., Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1985, 44:559-577), and, to a lesser extent, in the hippocampus (Spargo, E. et al., J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry 1993, 56:487-491) and the subthalamus (Byers, R. K. et al., Neurology 1973, 23:561-569).
      Huntingtin is crucial for normal development and may be regarded as a cell survival gene (Nasir et al., Human Molecular Genetics, Vol 5, 1431-1435). The normal function of huntingtin remains incompletely characterized, but based upon protein-protein interactions, it appears to be associated with the cytoskeleton and required for neurogenesis (Walling et al., J. Neurosci Res. 1998, 54:301-8). Huntingtin is specifically cleaved during apoptosis by a key cysteine protease, apopain, known to play a pivotal role in apoptotic cell death. The rate of cleavage is enhanced by longer polyglutamine tracts, suggesting that inappropriate apoptosis underlies HD.
      Antisense technology is emerging as an effective means for reducing the expression of specific gene products and may therefore prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications for the modulation of huntingtin expression. (See U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2008/0039418 and 2007/0299027)
      Antisense compounds for modulating expression of huntingtin are disclosed in the aforementioned published patent applications. However, there remains a need for additional such compounds.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002664862,"BACKGROUND ART
      With the advance of bioengineering and biotechnology, many bioactive polypeptides (proteins) and peptide medicines have been developed as therapeutic options for various diseases. Due to their low stability, however, such polypeptides or peptide medicines readily denature and thus are highly prone to renal or hepatic clearance. Accordingly, protein medicines comprising polypeptides as medicinally active ingredients suffer from the disadvantage of frequent necessary administration to patients to maintain appropriate serum levels and titers thereof. It is thus essential for the development of protein medicines that allow for them to be maintained at a proper level in the body without frequent administration.
      To solve these problems, a lot of effort has been devoted to improving the serum stability of protein drugs and maintaining high drug concentration level in blood for a prolonged period of time for the maximization of the pharmaceutical efficacy of the drugs, thus improving change of protein formulations, fusion with other proteins or binding polymer have been attempted. One of the most favored methods has been focused on the fusion of immunoglobulins to proteins in recent years.
      There have been many attempts made to increase the stability of protein medicines by use of immunoglobulins and their fragments, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,312 wherein human growth hormone is conjugated to bovine serum albumin or mouse immunoglobulin via a cross-linking agent. The conjugates have enhanced activity compared with unmodified growth hormone. Other various fusion proteins are also prepared as expressed in mammals after the Fc fragment of immunoglobulin is linked to interferon (Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2003-0009464), interleukin-4 receptor, interleukin-7 receptor or erythropoietin (Korean Patent No. 10-249572). PCT Patent Publication No. WO 01/03737 discloses a fusion protein in which a cytokine or a growth factor is linked through an oligopeptide linker to an Fc fragment of immunoglobulin. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,964 describes a protein which is fused to the amino or carboxy end of an immunoglobulin Fc fragment using a genetic recombination technique. U.S. Pat. No. 5,349,053 discloses a fusion protein in which IL-2 is linked to an immunoglobulin Fc fragment via a peptide linkage.
      Many other Fc fusion proteins constructed using genetic recombination techniques have been disclosed, examples of which include a fusion protein of an immunoglobulin Fc fragment with interferon-beta or a derivative thereof (PCT Patent Publication No. WO 00/23472), and an immunoglobulin Fc fragment with an IL-5 receptor (U.S. Pat. No. 5,712,121). Further, an immunoglobulin Fc fragment has been used as a carrier rather than a fusion partner, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,736,653.
      Production of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin Fc fragments has been carried out predominantly in E. coli. The American company Amgen Inc. described, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,843 and U.S. Pat. Publication Nos. 2004-0044188 and 2004-0053845, a human IgG1 Fc derivative having amino acid deletions at the first five amino acid residues of the hinge region, which is fused to the amino or carboxyl terminal end of a therapeutic protein or a therapeutic protein mimicked by a peptide, and the production thereof using an E. coli host. However, this fusion protein not having a signal sequence is expressed as inclusion bodies, and thus must be subjected to an additional refolding process. This protein refolding process reduces yields, and, especially in a protein present as a homodimer or a heterodimer, remarkably reduces dimer production. Also, when a protein not having a signal sequence is expressed in E. coli, a methionine residue is added to the N-terminus of the expression product due to the feature of the protein expression system of E. coli. The aforementioned expression products of Amgen Inc. have an N-terminal methionine residue, which may induce immune responses upon repeated or excessive administration to the body. Also, since these fusion molecules are expressed in a fusion protein form in E. coli by linking a gene encoding a therapeutic protein to an Fc gene they are difficult to express in E. coli, and a therapeutic protein is difficult to produce in E. coli if its expression in E. coli in a fused form results in a significant decrease or loss of activity. Further, since the fusion of two molecules creates a unnaturally-occurring abnormal amino acid sequence at the connection region between two proteins, the fusion protein could potentially be recognized as a foreign matter by the immune system, and thus induce immune responses.
      As described above, the use of E. coli is advantageous in that therapeutically effective proteins can be expressed as aglycosylated forms at high yield thanks to the rapid growth rate of E. coli and the accumulated technology of fermentation and bioengineering, but disadvantageous in that the recombinant proteins have methionine as the first amino terminal residue, as opposed to native proteins, and require a complex purification process in consideration of the removal of E. coli-derived pyrogens (endotoxins) and protein refolding.
      On the other hand, the use of animal cells advantageously allows for the production of fusion proteins as glycosylated proteins akin to native immunoglobulin forms, but suffers from the disadvantage of having high production cost, and being high prone to contamination with animal-derived viruses or proteins. There is therefore an increasing demand for solutions to the above-mentioned problems. Recommended is a strategy of utilizing yeasts having the advantages of both E. coli and animal cells as host cells.
      Representative among the yeast used for protein production is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition to being safe for the human body, the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae is easy to genetically manipulate and to culture on a large scale. Also, various expression systems for the eukaryote have been developed. When producing higher cell-derived proteins, such as human proteins, using a recombinant method, this microorganism moreover provides the proteins with the ability to be secreted outside the cells and be post-translationally modified, such as via glycosylation. In addition, the recombinant protein of the yeast undergoes folding, and disulfide bond formation, glycosylation during secretion signal-driven extracellular secretion, thus evolving to a fully bioactive form. The yeast is also economically beneficial because it does not require cell lysis and protein refolding, which are of low efficiency. What has been shown as a problem with the protein secretion system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is, however, the great variance in secretion rate depending on the kind of human protein. Often, proteins for use as human medicines of high value are difficult to express and secrete in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Korea Patent No. 10-0798894).

0002766679,"BACKGROUND ART
      Purine nucleotides, such as 5′-inosine monophosphate (hereinafter, IMP), 5′-xanthosine monophosphate (hereinafter, XMP), 5′-guanosine monophosphate (hereinafter, GMP), 5′-adenylic acid (hereinafter, AMP), etc., are intermediates of the metabolic system of nucleic acid biosynthesis. These intermediates play a physiologically important role in vivo and are widely used in food, medicine, etc. Among them, IMP with a beef flavor and GMP with a mushroom flavor are widely used as food seasoning additives. In addition, it has been known that when these two materials are mixed with monosodium glutamate (MSG), their flavors are further enhanced, and thus, a complex composite seasoning in which these three materials are combined is widely used.
      Meanwhile, examples of the method for producing a purine nucleotide may include: (1) a method by enzymatic degradation of ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted from yeast cells; (2) a method of preparation by fermentation by culturing a microorganism producing a purine nucleotide and directly recovering the purine nucleotide in the cultured liquid; (3) a method by chemical phosphorylation of the nucleoside produced by fermentation; and (4) a method by enzymatic phosphorylation of the nucleoside produced by fermentation, etc. (KR Patent No. 10-1049023, JP Patent Publication No. 4363042, KR Patent No. 10-1210704, and Agri. Biol. Chem., 36(9), 1511-1522). Among them, while Method (1) has problems in terms of supply/demand of raw materials and economic efficiency, Method (2) is widely used due to its economic and environmental advantages. Meanwhile, in the case of the production of GMP (one of purine nucleotides), there is a disadvantage in that the yield is low due to the problem of its cell membrane permeability, and thus, a method of GMP production by enzymatic conversion of XMP produced through microbial fermentation is also utilized.
      However, during the purine nucleotide production by fermentation using a microorganism, the microorganism may undergo stress due to temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, malnutrition, and oxidative factors. Among them, particularly in the oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is an inevitable factor generated during the fermentative production, becomes the main cause, and the ROS may cause abnormal growth of the microorganism.

      Specifically, the purine nucleotide may be at least one purine nucleotide selected from the group consisting of IMP, XMP, GMP, and AMP, but Purine nucleotides capable of increasing productivity by inactivating a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 can also be included without limitation.
      As used herein, the term, “protein consisting of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1” refers to a protein encoded by a gene of the WhiB-family group, and specifically, it may be a transcriptional regulator WhiB. The protein includes four conserved cysteine residues that form an oxygen and nitrogen oxides-sensitive cluster (4Fe-4S) and the protein is known to play an important role in exhibiting various biological properties of Actinomycetes. Its functions identified to date are known to be its involvement in overall cellular functions (e.g., pathogenesis, antibiotic resistance, cell growth, etc.), but their detailed functions and mechanisms have not been well studied.
      The protein having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of the present disclosure may be a protein including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, a protein essentially consisting of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, but the protein is not limited thereto.
      Additionally, the protein of the present disclosure may be a protein consisting of an amino acid sequence described as SEQ ID NO: 1, but any sequence having an activity identical to the protein can be included without limitation, and one of ordinary skill in the art can obtain sequence information from known databases (e.g., GenBank of the NCBI, etc.). Additionally, the protein having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of the present disclosure may be a protein including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a protein including an amino acid sequence having a homology or identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99%. Additionally, it is apparent that any protein having an amino acid sequence with deletion, modification, substitution, or addition in part of the sequence can also belong to the scope of the present disclosure, as long as the protein has an amino acid sequence with any of the above homologies or identities and exhibits a biological activity corresponding to the above protein.
      Furthermore, any polypeptide, which is encoded by a polynucleotide hybridized under stringent conditions with a probe that can be prepared from known gene sequences (e.g., sequences complementary to all or part of a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide constituting above protein) and has an activity identical to the protein consisting of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, can be included without limitation.
      That is, in the present disclosure, although it is described as “a protein or polypeptide including an amino acid sequence of a particular SEQ ID NO”, “a protein or polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence of a particular SEQ ID NO”, or “a protein or polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of a particular SEQ ID NO”, it is apparent that any protein which has an amino acid sequence with deletion, modification, substitution, conservative substitution or addition in part of the sequence can also be included within the scope of the present disclosure, as long as the protein has an activity identical or corresponding to the polypeptide consisting of an amino acid sequence of the particular SEQ ID NO.: for example, a case where a sequence that does not change the function of the protein is added to the N-terminus and/or C-terminus of the amino acid sequence, a case where the amino acid sequence has a naturally occurring mutation, or a case where the amino acid sequence has a silent mutation or conservative substitution thereof.
      The term “conservative substitution” refers to a substitution of one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties. Such an amino acid substitution may generally occur based on similarities in polarity, charge, solubility, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and/or amphipathic nature of residues. For example, positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine; negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include glutamic acid and aspartic acid; aromatic amino acids include phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine; and hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.
      As used herein, the term “polynucleotide” has a meaning that generally encompasses a DNA or RNA molecule, and a nucleotide (i.e., the basic structural unit of a polynucleotide) can include not only natural nucleotides, but also its analogs in which the sugar or base moiety is modified (see Scheit, Nucleotide Analogs, John Wiley, New York (1980); Uhlman and Peyman, Chemical Reviews, 90:543-584 (1990)).
      The polynucleotide sequence of a gene encoding the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 can be obtained from a known database (e.g., GenBank of the NCBI, etc.), but is not limited thereto.
      The polynucleotide may be a polynucleotide encoding the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of the present disclosure, or a polynucleotide encoding the protein having a homology or identity to the protein of the present disclosure of 60%, 70%, 80%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99%.
      Specifically, the protein having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 may be a polynucleotide having a homology or identity to the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 of at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100%. However, it is apparent that any polynucleotide sequence, which encodes the protein having an activity corresponding to the protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, can be included in the scope of the present disclosure, without being limited thereto.
      Additionally, it is apparent that, based on the genetic code degeneracy, any polynucleotide which can be translated into a protein consisting of the same amino acid sequence or a protein having a homology thereto can also be included in the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally, the nucleotide sequence may be any sequence capable of hybridizing with a probe, which can be prepared from a known gene sequence (e.g., a sequence complementary to all or part of the above nucleotide sequences), under stringent conditions to encode a protein having the activity of the protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.
      The term “stringent conditions” refers to conditions which enables specific hybridization between polynucleotides. Such conditions are specifically described in a literature (e.g., J. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989; F. M. Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York). The conditions may include performing hybridization between genes having a high homology or identity, for example, a homology or identity of 40% or higher, specifically 70% or higher, 80% or higher, 85% or higher, and 90% or higher, more specifically 95% or higher, even more specifically 97% or higher, and most specifically 99% or higher, while not performing hybridization between genes having a homology or identity of lower than the above homologies or identities; or performing conventional washing conditions for southern hybridization, i.e., washing once, specifically, twice or three times at a salt concentration and temperature corresponding to 60° C., 1×SSC, and 0.1% SDS, specifically 60° C., 0.1×SSC, and 0.1% SDS, and more specifically 68° C., 0.1×SSC, and 0.1% SDS. Hybridization requires that two nucleic acids have a complementary sequence(s), although there may be a mismatch(es) between bases depending on the stringency of the hybridization. The term “complementary” is used to describe the relationship between nucleotide bases that can hybridize with each other. For example, with respect to DNA, adenosine is complementary to thymine while cytosine is complementary to guanine. Accordingly, the present disclosure may also include isolated nucleic acid fragments complementary to the entire sequence as well as substantially similar nucleic acid sequences.
      Specifically, polynucleotides having a homology or identity can be detected at a T m value of 55° C. using hybridization conditions that include a hybridization step and using the conditions described above. Additionally, the T m value may be 60° C., 63° C., or 65° C., but the temperature is not limited thereto and may be appropriately adjusted by those skilled in the art according to the purpose.
      The stringency suitable for the hybridization of polynucleotides depends on the length and degree of complementarity of the polynucleotides, and the variables are well known in the art (see Sambrook et al., supra, 9.50 to 9.51 and 11.7 to 11.8).
      As used herein, the term “homology” or “identity” refers to a degree of identity between two given amino acid sequences or nucleotide sequences, and they may be expressed as a percentage. These terms “homology” and “identity” may often be used interchangeably. In the present specification, a homologous sequence having an activity identical or similar to a given amino acid sequence or polynucleotide sequence is represented as “% homology”.
      Sequence homology or identity of conserved polynucleotides or polypeptides is determined by standard alignment algorithm, and default gap penalties established by a program being used may be used together. Actually, homologous or identical sequences may hybridize to each other along the entire sequence or at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% or more of the entire length under moderate or highly stringent conditions. In hybridization, polynucleotides including a degenerate codon(s) instead of a codon(s) are also considered.
      Whether any two polynucleotide- or polypeptide sequences have a homology, similarity, or identity can be determined using computer algorithms known in the art (e.g., “FASTA” program using default parameters disclosed by Pearson et al. (1988) [ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 2444]). Alternatively, Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (1970 , J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443-453) performed in a Needleman program of The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite of EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000, Trends Genet. 16: 276-277) (version 5.0.0 or a later version) may be used to determine the same (including GCG program package (Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids Research 12: 387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, FASTA (Atschul, [S.] [F.,] [ET AL., J Molec Biol 215]: 403 (1990); Guide to Huge Computers, Martin J. Bishop, [ED.,] Academic Press, San Diego, 1994, and [CARILLO ETA/.](1988) SIAM J Applied Math 48: 1073). For example, homology, similarity, or identity may be determined using BLAST from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database or ClustalW.
      The homology, similarity, or identity between polynucleotides or polypeptides, for example, may be determined by comparing the given sequence information using the GAP computer program, such as a program introduced by Needleman et al. ( J Mol Biol. 48: 443 (1970)) as disclosed by Smith and Waterman ( Adv. Appl. Math (1981) 2: 482). In brief, the GAP program defines homology, similarity, or identity as the number of similar aligned symbols (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids) divided by the total number of the symbols in a shorter of the two sequences. The default parameters for the GAP program may include: (1) a unary comparison matrix (including a value 1 for identity and a value 0 for non-identity) and the weighted comparison matrix of Gribskov, et al., ( Nucl. Acids Res. 14: 6745 (1986)) as described by Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds. (Atlas Of Protein Sequence And Structure, National Biomedical Research Foundation, pp. 353-358 (1979) or EDNAFULL (EMBOSS version of NCBI NUC4.4) substitution matrix); (2) a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap (or a gap open penalty of 10 and a gap extension penalty of 0.5); and (3) no penalty for end gaps. Therefore, the term “homology” or “identity”, as used herein, refers to the relevance between sequences.
      In the present disclosure, the microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium producing a purine nucleotide may be one in which a protein including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 is inactivated.
      In particular, the inactivation of the protein including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 may be used interchangeably in the same sense as in the inactivation of the WhiB-family protein, the inactivation of the WhiB transcriptional regulator, or the inactivation of a protein encoded by a gene including the polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.
      As used herein, the term “the protein including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 is inactivated” means that the protein including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 is not expressed at all; or the protein may be expressed but it has no or reduced activity, compared to its parent strain or a non-modified strain. Additionally, the above term means that the protein WhcEDBA, which is encoded by a gene of the WhiB-family group, has no activity or its activity is reduced, compared to its parent strain or a non-modified strain. In particular, the reduction described above is a concept which includes a case where the activity of a protein is reduced due to a mutation, deletion, etc. of a gene encoding the protein compared to the activity of the protein originally possessed by a microorganism; a case where the degree of the overall intercellular activity of the protein is lower than that of its native wild-type strain or the strain before modification, due to inhibition of expression of the gene encoding the protein or inhibition of translation of the gene, etc.; and a combination of both cases.
      In the present disclosure, it was first confirmed that inactivation of the above protein is related to the productivity of purine nucleotides.
      In the present disclosure, the inactivation may be achieved by the application of various methods known in the art. Examples of the methods include: 1) a method of deleting all or part of the gene encoding the protein; 2) a method of modifying the expression control sequence to reduce the expression of the gene encoding the protein; 3) a method of modifying the sequence of the gene encoding the protein so that the activity of the protein is removed or weakened; 4) a method of introducing an antisense oligonucleotide (e.g., antisense RNA), which binds complementarily to a transcript of the gene encoding the protein; 5) a method of making the attachment of a ribosome impossible by forming a secondary structure by adding a sequence, which is complementary to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, on a front end of the SD sequence of the gene encoding the protein; 6) a method of reverse transcription engineering (RTE), in which a reversely-transcribed promoter is added to the 3′ terminus of the open reading frame (ORF) of the polynucleotide sequence of the gene encoding the protein, etc.; and the inactivation may be achieved by a combination of these methods, but the methods are not particularly limited thereto.
      Specifically, the method of deleting all or part of the gene encoding the protein may be performed by replacing the polynucleotide encoding the endogenous target protein within the chromosome with a polynucleotide or marker gene having a partially-deleted nucleotide sequence using a vector for chromosomal insertion in a microorganism. As an example of the method of deleting all or part of a polynucleotide, a method of deleting a polynucleotide by homologous recombination may be used, but the method is not limited thereto.
      Additionally, the method of deleting all or part of the gene may be performed such that a mutation is induced in the gene using light (e.g., ultraviolet rays) or chemicals, and strains in which a target gene is deleted are selected from the mutants obtained. The above method of deleting a gene includes a method by DNA recombinant technology. In the DNA recombination technology, for example, there may be a method in which homologous recombination occurs by introducing a nucleotide sequence or vector containing a nucleotide sequence homologous to a target gene into the microorganism.
      Additionally, the nucleotide sequence or vector to be introduced may include a dominant selectable marker, but is not limited thereto.
      Additionally, the method of modifying an expression control sequence may be achieved by the application of various methods known in the art. As examples of the method, the modification of the expression control sequence may be performed by inducing a mutation in the polynucleotide sequence by deletion, insertion, non-conservative or conservative substitution, or a combination thereof so as to further weaken the activity of the expression control sequence; or by replacing the polynucleotide sequence with a polynucleotide sequence having a weaker activity. The expression control sequence may include a promoter, an operator sequence, a sequence encoding a ribosome-binding site, sequences controlling the termination of transcription and translation, etc., but the expression control sequence is not limited thereto.
      Additionally, the method of modifying a gene sequence may be performed by inducing a mutation in the gene sequence by deletion, insertion, non-conservative or conservative substitution, or a combination thereof so as to further weaken the activity of the protein; or by replacing the gene sequence with a gene sequence improved to have a weaker activity or a gene sequence improved to have no activity, but the method of modifying a gene sequence is not limited thereto.
      As used herein, the term “microorganism producing a purine nucleotide” or “microorganism having a purine nucleotide-producing ability” refers to a microorganism which naturally has a purine nucleotide-producing ability; or a microorganism in which a purine nucleotide-producing ability, which is not possessed by its parent strain, is provided. Specifically, the microorganism may be one, in which the protein including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, a WhiB-family protein, or a WhiB transcriptional regulator is inactivated, thus having a purine nucleotide-producing ability.
      In the present disclosure, “microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium” may include all microorganisms of the genus Corynebacterium. Specifically, the microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium may be Corynebacterium stationis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Corynebacterium phocae, Corynebacterium flavescens, Corynebacterium humireducens, Corynebacterium halotolerans, Corynebacterium pollutisoli, Corynebacterium marinum, Corynebacterium freiburgense, Corynebacterium cystitidis, Corynebacterium durum, Corynebacterium pilosum, or Corynebacterium testudinoris, and more specifically Corynebacterium stationis, but the microorganism is not limited thereto.
      Meanwhile, although it has been already known that a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium can produce purine nucleotides, the microorganism has a significantly low nucleotide-producing ability and the gene acting on its production mechanism or the principle of the mechanism has not been known. Accordingly, the microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium producing a purine nucleotide of the present disclosure refers to a wild-type microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium itself; a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium in which the activity of the gene associated with the mechanism of purine nucleotide production is enhanced or inactivated, thus having an improved purine nucleotide-producing ability; or a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium in which the activity of an exogenous gene is introduced or enhanced, thus having an improved purine nucleotide-producing ability. Specifically, the microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium may be Corynebacterium stationis in which the biosynthetic pathway of purine nucleotides is enhanced, and the enhancement may mean that the activity of a protein involved in the biosynthetic pathway is enhanced. Alternatively, the microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium may be Corynebacterium stationis in which the activity of a protein involved in the degradation pathway of purine nucleotides or their precursor(s) is inactivated.
      In particular, in the case where the purine nucleotide is 5′-inosine monophosphate (IMP), examples of the protein involved in the biosynthetic pathway of purine nucleotides may include at least one protein selected from the group consisting of amidophosphoribosyltransferase (PurF), phosphoribosylamine-glycine ligase (PurD), phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (PurN), phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase (PurL), AIR synthetase (FGAM cyclase), phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase, phosphoribosylaminoimidazolesuccinocarboxamide synthase, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase, and inosine monophosphate synthase.
      Additionally, in the case where the purine nucleotide is 5′-xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), examples of the protein in which the activity is enhanced may further include IMP dehydrogenase, in addition to the group consisting of the above proteins.
      Additionally, in the case where the purine nucleotide is 5′-guanosine monophosphate (GMP), examples of the protein in which the activity is enhanced may further include IMP dehydrogenase and/or GMP synthase, in addition to the group consisting of the above proteins.
      Additionally, in the case where the purine nucleotide is 5′-adenylic acid (AMP), examples of the protein in which the activity is enhanced may further include adenylosuccinate synthase (purA), in addition to the group consisting of the above proteins.
      Most specifically, the protein involved in the biosynthetic pathway of purine nucleotides may be amidophosphoribosyltransferase (PurF), but the protein is not limited thereto.
      Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for producing purine nucleotides, which includes a step of culturing the above microorganism according to the present disclosure in a medium.
      The above production method may further include a step of recovering purine nucleotides.
      The microorganism and purine nucleotides are as described above.
      As used herein, the term “culture” means that a microorganism is grown under appropriately and artificially controlled environmental conditions. In the present disclosure, the culture process of a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium may be performed using the methods widely known in the art. Specifically, the culture may be performed continuously in a batch process, fed batch process, or repeated fed batch process, but the culture process is not limited thereto.
      The step of culturing the microorganism may be performed in batch culture, continuous culture, fed batch culture, etc. known in the art, but the step of culturing the microorganism is not particularly limited thereto. The medium and other culture conditions used for culturing the microorganism of the present disclosure are not particularly limited, but any medium used in the conventional culture for a microorganism may be used. Specifically, the microorganism of the present disclosure may be cultured under aerobic conditions in a conventional medium containing an appropriate carbon source, nitrogen source, phosphorus source, inorganic compound, amino acid, and/or vitamin, etc. while adjusting temperature, pH, etc. The medium for culturing a Corynebacterium strain is known (e.g., Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology by the American Society for Bacteriology, Washington D.C., USA, 1981).
      The carbon sources that can be used in the medium include saccharides and carbohydrates (e.g., glucose, saccharose, lactose, fructose, maltose, starch, and cellulose), oils and fats (e.g., soybean oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, and coconut oil), fatty acids (e.g., palmitic acid, stearic acid, and linoleic acid), alcohols (e.g., glycerol and ethanol), organic acids (e.g., acetic acid), etc. These materials may be used alone or as a mixture, but are not limited thereto.
      The nitrogen sources that can be used in the medium include peptone, yeast extract, meat gravy, malt extract, corn steep liquor, bean flour, and urea, or an inorganic compound (e.g., ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate, and ammonium nitrate), etc. The nitrogen sources may also be used alone or as a mixture, but are not limited thereto.
      The phosphorous sources that can be used in the medium may include potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium-containing salts corresponding thereto. Additionally, the culture medium may include a metal salt (e.g., magnesium sulfate or iron sulfate) required for growth. Finally, the culture medium may include essential growth materials (e.g., amino acids and vitamins), in addition to the above materials. Additionally, precursors suitable for a culture medium may be used. The above raw materials may be added in a batch culture mode or continuous culture mode during a culture process by a method suitable for a cultured medium.
      The pH of a cultured medium may be adjusted during the culture of the microorganism using a base compound (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and ammonia) or an acid compound (e.g., phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid) in an appropriate manner. Additionally, foam generation can be prevented using an antifoaming agent (e.g., fatty acid polyglycol ester). Additionally, oxygen or oxygen-containing gas (e.g., air) may be injected into the cultured medium in order to maintain an aerobic state of the cultured medium. The temperature of the cultured medium may normally be maintained at 20° C. to 45° C., and specifically 25° C. to 40° C. The culture process may be continued until the desired amount of L-amino acid production is obtained, and specifically, for 10 to 160 hours.
      The purine nucleotides produced by the above culture process may be released into the medium or remain in the cells.
      The method for producing purine nucleotides of the present disclosure, after the step of culture, may further include a step of recovering purine nucleotides from the microorganism or the medium.
      The recovery of the purine nucleotides may be performed by a conventional method known in the art. As the method for recovery, centrifugation, filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, crystallization, etc. may be used. For example, the cultured medium may be centrifuged at a low speed to remove biomass and the obtained supernatant may be separated through ion exchange chromatography, but the method for recovery is not limited thereto, and the desired purine nucleotides may be recovered from the cultured microorganism or the medium by an appropriate method known in the art.
      The recovery step may further include a separation process and/or a purification process.
      Still another aspect of the present disclosure provides a use of a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium, in which a protein including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 is inactivated, for the increase of purine nucleotide production
      Still another aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for increasing the production of purine nucleotides, which includes a step of inactivating the protein that includes the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 of the present disclosure in a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium.
      The terms “purine nucleotide”, “a protein including the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1”, “inactivation” and “a microorganism of the genus Corynebacterium” are as described above.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
0002573832,"BACKGROUND
      The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.
      Many power supplies use fast switching diodes to rectify the output voltage of the power supply. In general, diodes allow current to flow in one direction through the diode when a forward bias voltage is applied across the diode. When a reverse bias voltage is applied across the diode, the diode should act as an open switch and prevent current from flowing in the opposite direction.
       FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional boost converter, which is indicated generally by reference numeral 100. The converter 100 includes an inductor 102, a diode 104, a switch 106 and an output capacitor 108. The operation of a conventional boost converter is well known to those skilled in the art and will therefore be explained only briefly herein. In use, a DC input voltage 110 is applied between the inductor 102 and a reference node 112 (also referred to as ground). The switch 106 opens and closes at a high frequency. When the switch 106 is closed, current flows from the DC input voltage 110, through the inductor 102 and the switch 106, to ground 112. When the switch 106 opens, Current flows through the inductor 102 and the diode 104 to charge the output capacitor 108 and supply power to a load 114. When the switch 106 closes again, the capacitor 108 discharges current to the load 114. During this time, the diode 104 should prevent current from flowing back toward the switch 106.
      However, the high switching frequency of modern power supplies can result in a large change in voltage across the diode 104 as a function of time (dv/dt). This leads to a brief time during which a reverse current flows through the diode 104 (from the cathode to the anode). This reverse current is known in the art as diode reverse recovery current.
       FIG. 2 illustrates the current 216 flowing through the diode 104 before and after the switch position changes from open to closed at time t 0. As shown in FIG. 2, the current decreases to zero amps at time t 1. At that point, the current becomes negative and begins to flow in the opposite direction, resulting in a reverse recovery current that peaks at time t 2. The reverse recovery current then decreases back to zero amps at time t 3.
      The reverse recovery current increases the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by the converter 100. The reverse recovery spike illustrated in FIG. 2 also limits the switching frequency of the converter 100 and requires use of a more robust and hence more expensive diode 104.
       FIG. 3 illustrates a boost converter 300 employing one known method for suppressing diode reverse recovery Current. The boost converter 300 includes a main winding 302, a main diode 304, a switch 306, and an output capacitor 308. An input voltage 310 is coupled between the main winding and ground 312 so that an output voltage can be supplied to a load 314. The boost converter 300 includes additional elements, generally indicated by reference number 318, to limit diode reverse recovery current. Specifically, the additional elements 318 include an auxiliary winding 320 (coupled to the main winding 302) connected in series with an inductor 322 and an auxiliary diode 324.
      When the switch 306 is closed, current flows through the main winding 302 and the switch 306 to ground 312. When the switch 306 opens, current initially flows through the main winding 302 and the main diode 304 to the output capacitor 308 and load 314. This results in a voltage across the additional elements 318 that forward biases the auxiliary diode 324 and causes current to flow through the additional elements 318. This current increases until all current from the main winding 302 is channeled through the additional elements 318. This diversion of current from the main diode 304 to the auxiliary diode 324 is completed before the switch 306 closes to begin the next cycle. Therefore, when the switch 306 closes, no current is flowing through the main diode 304 and the reverse recovery current in the main diode 304 is greatly decreased. Additionally, the leakage inductance of the coupled main and auxiliary windings 302, 320 prevent the current flowing through the additional elements 318 from changing rapidly. As a result, the reverse recovery current through the auxiliary diode 324 is limited.
       FIG. 4 illustrates a boost converter 400 employing another known method for suppressing diode reverse recovery current. The boost converter 400 includes a main winding 402, a main diode 404, a switch 406, and an output capacitor 408. An input voltage 410 is coupled between the main winding 402 and ground 412 so that an output voltage can be supplied to a load 414. The boost converter 400 also includes additional elements, generally indicated by reference number 418, to limit diode reverse recovery current. Specifically, the additional elements 418 include an auxiliary winding 420 (coupled to the main winding 402) connected in series with an auxiliary diode 424. The auxiliary winding 420 has more turns than the main winding 402. Additionally, the auxiliary winding 420 and the auxiliary diode 424 are connected to the input voltage 410 in parallel with the main winding 402 and the main diode 404.
      When the switch 406 is closed, current flows through the main winding 402 and the switch 406 to ground. When the switch 406 opens, current initially flows through the main winding 402 and the main diode 404 to the output capacitor 408 and load 414. Current then begins to flow, at an increasing rate, through the additional elements 418 until all current from the voltage source 410 is channeled through the additional elements 418. This diversion of current from the main diode 404 to the auxiliary diode 424 occurs before the switch 406 closes to begin the next cycle. Therefore, when the switch closes, no current is flowing through the main diode 404 and the reverse recovery current in the main diode 404 is greatly decreased. Additionally, various factors including the leakage inductance of the coupled main and auxiliary windings 402, 420 prevent the current flowing through the additional elements 418 from changing rapidly. As a result the reverse recovery current through the auxiliary diode 424 is limited.
      Although the converters 300, 400 of FIGS. 3 and 4 are useful for certain applications, the present inventor has recognized a need for new approaches to suppressing diode reverse recovery current in switching power converters.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a switching power converter includes at least one input terminal for receiving an input voltage, at least one output terminal for supplying an output voltage, a coupled choke having a main winding and an auxiliary winding, an output capacitor coupled to the output terminal, a main diode coupled between the auxiliary winding and the output terminal, and a switch having at least first and second positions. The main and auxiliary windings are connected to be charged by an input voltage when the input voltage is coupled to the input terminal and the switch is in the first position. The auxiliary winding is connected to reverse bias the main diode when the input voltage is coupled to the input terminal and the switch is switched from the first position to the second position to thereby suppress reverse recovery current in the main diode.
      The power converter may also include an auxiliary diode coupled between a common node of the main and auxiliary windings and the output terminal such that a current through the auxiliary diode increases as a current through the main diode decreases when the input voltage is coupled to the input terminal and the switch is switched from the first position to the second position. In some embodiments, the auxiliary diode is directly connected to the auxiliary winding. In other embodiments, an inductor (which may be a saturable inductor) is coupled between the auxiliary diode and the auxiliary winding.

0002481398,"BACKGROUND
      WT1 gene (Wilms' tumor 1 gene) was identified as a gene responsible for Wilms tumor which is a renal cancer in children (Non-patent Documents 1 and 2). WT1 is a transcription factor having a zinc finger structure. At the beginning, the WT1 gene was considered to be a tumor suppressor gene. However, subsequent studies (Non-patent Documents 3, 4, 5 and 6) showed that the WT1 gene rather functions as an oncogene in hematopoietic tumors and solid cancers.
      The WT1 gene is expressed at high levels in many types of malignant tumors. Then, it has been examined whether or not the WT1 gene product free of mutations, which is an autologous protein, has immunogenicity in a living body. The results revealed that the protein derived from the WT1 gene which is expressed at high levels in tumor cells is fragmented through intracellular processing, the resulting peptides form complexes with MHC class I molecules, and the complexes are presented on the surfaces of cells, and that CTLs recognizing such complexes can be induced by peptide vaccination (Non-patent Documents 7, 8 and 9). It was also shown that in a mouse immunized with a WT1 peptide or a WT1 cDNA, transplanted tumor cells expressing a WT1 gene are rejected with a high probability (Non-patent Documents 7 and 10), while normal tissues expressing physiologically the WT1 gene are not damaged by the induced CTLs (Non-patent Document 7). It was shown in in vitro experiments using human cells that when Db126 peptide or WH187 peptide (amino acids 187-195 of SEQ ID No: 1, SLGEQQYSV) having a high ability to bind to an HLA-A*0201 molecule, which is one of human MHC class I molecules, is used to stimulate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells having HLA-A*0201, WT1-specific CTLs are induced, the induced CTLs have a cytotoxic activity specific for tumor cells expressing endogenously a WT1 gene at high levels, and the cytotoxic activity of such CTLs is HLA-A2-restricted (Non-patent Document 11). It was shown in in vitro experiments in human cells using WT1 peptide that matches HLA-A*2402 (which is found most frequently in Japanese people among HLA-A alleles) (WT1235; amino acids 235-243 of SEQ ID No: 1, CMTWNQMNL) that WT1-specific CTLs (TAK-1) are induced (Non-patent Document 12), and the induced CTLs do not suppress the colony-forming activity of normal hematopoietic stem cells which partially express physiologically a WT1 gene (Non-patent Documents 12 and 13). These reports strongly suggest that not only in mice but also in human beings, WT1-specific CTLs can be induced, such CTLs have a cytotoxic activity against tumor cells expressing a WT1 gene at high levels, but do not have a cytotoxic activity against normal cells expressing physiologically a WT1 gene (Non-patent Documents 7, 10, 11, 12 and 13).
      The WT1 gene product is present as a nuclear protein, and is processed by proteasomes in cytoplasm to be fragmented into peptides. The fragmented peptides are transported into endoplasmic reticulum lumen by TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) molecules, form complexes with MHC class I molecules, and are presented on the surfaces of cells. WT1-specific CTLs are induced as a result of recognition of WT1 peptide-MHC class I molecule complexes by CTL precursor cells via TCR, thereby exerting a cytotoxic effect on tumor cells presenting a WT1 gene product through MHC class I molecules (Non-patent Documents 7, 8 and 9). Then, it is required at least that a WT1 peptide used in cancer immunotherapy targeting a WT1 gene product is in the form that binds to an MHC class I molecule in a living body. However, MHC class I molecules are diverse and amino acid sequences of the WT1 peptides binding to respective MHC class I molecules are different from each other. Therefore, it is required to provide a peptide matching each subtype of MHC class I. However, only HLA-A*2402 molecule-, HLA-A*0201 molecule-, HLA-A*2601 molecule- and HLA-A*3303 molecule-restricted peptides are known as HLA molecule-restricted WT1 peptides to date (Patent Document 1, Non-patent Document 11, Patent Document 2 and Patent Document 3, respectively). Thus, there is a need to find an HLA-A*1101-restricted WT1 peptide.

0002527561,"BACKGROUND
      Recent investigations have shown that Protein Phosphatase-1 (PP 1) is required for transcription of HIV-1 (Ammosova, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 280, No. 43, 36364-36371 (2005)). It appears that HIV-1 Tat binds to PP1 through the Q 35VCF 38 sequence of the Tat, and translocates PP1 to the nucleus of an infected cell. It was envisaged that a small-molecule inhibitor of the binding of PP1 to the HIV-1 Tat should inhibit HIV-1 transcription. This should in turn provide a way to treat subjects infected with HIV-1.
SUMMARY

Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the compounds inhibit interaction between PP1 and an HIV-1 Tat, thereby inhibiting HIV-1 transcription. The compounds have been shown to inhibit HIV-1 transcription in living cells. The compounds are thus useful for treating or preventing HIV-1 infections.

200100756,"PRIOR ART
Most of the methods used to prepare and purify the disease-causing agents of TSEs involve a complex sequence of enzyme and detergent treatments and centrifugations (Bolton et al., J. Virol. 53:596, 1985). Abnormal prion protein is poorly soluble in the typical biological buffers. One method for obtaining purified abnormal prion protein is hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) (Alpert, J., Chromatogr. 499:177, 1990), which is the inverse of reversed-phase chromatography. Typically, one starts with 70-85% organic solvent and runs a decreasing organic gradient. Elution is in the order of least to most polar. The mostly organic mobile phases of HILIC are compatible with proteins not normally occurring free in aqueous solution, such as membrane proteins (Jeno et al., Anal. Biochem. 215:292, 1993), β-amyloid peptide (1-43) (Alpert et al., Eighth Symposium of the Protein Society, July 1994, San Diego, Calif.), and histones (Lindner et al., J. Chromatogr. A. 782:55, 1997). Surfactants and other denaturants elute in or near the void volume, while proteins and peptides are generally well-retained.
After HILIC purification, the prion protein can be detected using capillary electrophoresis immunoassay (Schmerr and Jenny, Electrophoresis 19:409, 1998) or by capillary isoelectric focusing (Schmerr et al., J. Chromatogr. A. 802:135, 1998).
As noted above, present analytical methods to detect abnormal prion protein generally are used post mortem, thus there is a need for an antemortem assay for abnormal prion protein. In addition, a method is required for isolation of abnormal prion protein without ultracentrifugation steps, which require instrumentation that is not readily available to veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Centrifugation requires the presence of abnormal prion protein as aggregates, whose large size facilitates pellet formation in the centrifuge tubes. Such aggregates are difficult to dissolve and detect in subsequent steps. The use of centrifugation also jeopardizes the possibility of detecting monomeric abnormal prion protein, potentially decreasing the sensitivity of any assay. There is an even more pressing need for a fast, reliable field assay, such as a qualitative immunoassay, to test livestock for infection with a TSE. Thus, there is a need in the art for an efficient, simple method for extracting abnormal prion protein.
Additionally, the antibodies that have been produced detect abnormal prion protein in its monomeric form, with the exception of the antibody produced to the native abnormal prion protein (Korth et al., Nature 390:74, 1997). As a result, abnormal prion protein must be deaggregated with strong detergents or denaturants; these denaturants must then be removed before performing most immunoassays. Thus, there is a need in the art for a rapid, simple method to extract prion protein free of detergents or denaturants for immunoassay analysis.
The present invention provides a new method for the extraction of all sizes of the abnormal prion protein, whether in aggregated or monomeric form. The invention makes it possible to test for abnormal prion protein in samples from a live animal, e.g., using immunoassays. For example, diagnosis can be based on blood samples, which will allow for the testing of live animals and facilitate the removal of infected animals from flocks and herds, and prevent possible contamination of products for consumption.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides a method for extracting abnormal prion protein from a biological material suspected of containing abnormal prion protein. The method comprises incubating a mixture of extraction solvent and an isotonic or hypotonic aqueous preparation of the biological material under conditions effective to extract abnormal prion protein from the biological material into the extraction solvent. The extraction solvent is a polar organic solvent in which the abnormal prion protein is soluble, and it is miscible with a hypotonic or isotonic aqueous solution but immiscible with a lyotropic aqueous solution. Lyotropic activity of the mixture is increased so that the extraction solvent separates as a distinct phase from the aqueous preparation of the biological material to yield extraction solvent containing any abnormal prion protein from the biological material.
The invention further provides a method for detecting the presence of abnormal prion protein in an animal, comprising assaying a separated extraction solvent prepared as described above for abnormal prion protein.
Also provided is a kit for isolating abnormal prion protein from a biological sample. The kit comprises an extraction solvent, which has the characteristics set forth above, and a lyotropic salt or aqueous lyotropic salt solution to add to an aqueous preparation of a biological sample so that the organic solvent becomes immiscible with the aqueous preparation. In another embodiment of the invention, the kit includes a prion protein detection assay, preferably an assay for an abnormal prion protein.
Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide a rapid method for isolating abnormal prion protein from a biological sample.
It is also an object of the invention to provide an early detection method for organisms infected with abnormal prion protein.
It is a further object of the invention to provide a solvent extraction technique for isolating abnormal prion protein from a biological sample.
Still another object of the invention is to simplify analytical testing of a biological material from an animal or human for the presence of abnormal prion protein.
Yet another object of the invention is to provide an extract containing abnormal prion protein for further testing or purification.
These and other objects of the invention are presented in greater detail in the accompanying Drawings and Detailed Description of the Invention.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02214417,"BACKGROUND
      The immune system is an extraordinarily complex combination of cells and compositions that protects a mammalian host against a wide variety of pathogens, while surveiling the body against deleterious aberrations, such as neoplasia. One branch of the immune system involves the cells that carry out immune system functions, including both (a) lymphocytes, such as the bone marrow-derived B-lymphocytes, the thymus-derived T lymphocytes and natural-killer (NK) cells, and (b) the mononuclear phagocytes, including both monocytes and macrophages. While lymphocytes are primarily associated with specific immune responses, due to their ability to specifically recognize and distinguish antigenic determinants, the mononuclear phagocytes are most often involved in the general removal of foreign microbes through phagocytosis as well as the production and secretion of cytokines as induced either directly by a microbe itself or in response to antigen-stimulated T lymphocytes. The functions of lymphocytic cells and the mononuclear phagocytes are highly interconnected and essential for proper immune system function.
      One important subset of lymphocytic cells are T lymphocytes, which derive their designation from the fact that they are processed by the thymus. T lymphocytes are a complex group of cells which may be cytotoxic, having numerous mechanisms for inducing cell death, or activating, by secreting varous cytokines that function to activate other cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (“CTLs”) act by being restricted to a particular major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen and express a cell surface T cell receptor which comprises both an α and β chain and which has specific affinity for a particular MHC complex associated with a peptide in the groove of the MHC. CTLs have been screened so that they do not normally act against cells where the peptide in the groove is endogenous to the host. However, where the MHC is foreign or the peptide in the groove is foreign to the host, the CTLs will attack such cell and kill it. Other lymphocytic cells which play important roles in the immune response include B-lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, both of whose activity may be influenced by other cells of the immune system and various cytokine polypeptides.
      The mononuclear phagocytes constitute a second major cell population of the immune system and consist of cells having a common lineage whose primary function is phagocytosis. The mononuclear phagocytes derive from progenitor bone marrow stem cells and, after maturation and subsequent activation, can achieve various morphological forms, including incompletely differentiated monocyte cells and macrophages. Proper function of the mononuclear phagocytes is dependent on the ability to both produce and respond to various cytokine proteins.
      Cytokines, such as the various interferons, interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, chemokines, hematopoietic growth factors and migration inhibition factors are a diverse group of proteins that are produced by a wide variety of different cells types of the immune system. Most importantly, cytokines are produced and/or responded to by various lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes in response to various stimuli. For the most part, cytokines are produced during the effector phases of both natural and specific immunity and serve to mediate and regulate both immune and inflammatory responses. Cytokines, like other polypeptide hormones, initiate their action by binding to specific receptors on the surface of target cells, their activation often resulting in an inflammatory response.
      While activation of the immune response and cytokine-induced inflammatory responses are extremely important to a host's health and proper functioning of the immune system, there are a number of situations where such activation is undesired. One particular area is associated with transplantation, where one rarely has an identical match between the donor and recipient of the MHC antigens. Another incidence is where there is a failure on the part of CTLs in that they attack cells where the MHC and associated peptide are both endogenous, as occurs in autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). An additional incidence is where a cytokine-mediated inflammatory response functions to adversely affect the health of the host, such as inflammatory responses associated with such maladies as septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, colitis, and the like.
      Immunosuppression has become a general approach in situations where activation of CTLs is undesired. However, immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin A, FK506, and the like, have numerous undesirable side effects. Additionally, various approaches have been employed for controlling or inhibiting inflammatory responses, however, many of these approaches also have one or more undesirable effects. There is, therefore, substantial interest in identifying new agents which can act to inhibit the activation of lymphocytic cells, particularly CTLs, while having less of a universal immunosuppressive effect on the immune system and fewer side effects, so as to leave the host with a substantial proportion of the immune system for protection against adventitious infection. There is also a substantial interest in identifying new agents that function to control or inhibit adverse inflammatory reactions.
      In the last few years, oligopeptides have been reported as being effective in modulating immune system activity and extending the lifetime of allogeneic transplants. These oligopeptides are based on the human leukocyte antigen-B (HLA-B) α1-domain and have a conserved amino acid sequence Arg-X-X-X-Arg-X-X-X-X-Tyr, (SEQ ID NO: 1) with the various amino acids designated as X varying within a relatively few amino acids to retain activity (e.g., see WO 95/13288). The mechanism by which these oligopeptides effectuate their activity is not understood, particularly as to how they cooperate with subtherapeutic doses of cyclosporin to extend the lifetime of allogeneic transplants.
      Also reported (Manolios, NOVEL PEPTIDE, PCT application, filed based on Australian application Nos. PN 0589 and PN 0590, Jan. 16, 1995) as having an effect on T cell mediated inflammation are oligopeptides of the formula:
      A-B-C-D-E
         wherein: A is absent or is 1 or 2 hydrophobic residues; B is a positively charged amino acid; C is a peptide consisting of from 3 to 5 hydrophobic amino acids; D is a positively charged amino acid; and E is absent or is up to 8 hydrophobic amino acids. The peptides that were synthesized are: Gly-Leu-Arg-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Lys-Val (SEQ ID NO: 2); Met-Gly-Leu-Arg-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 3); Leu-Gly-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Gly-Val (SEQ ID NO4); Leu-Asp-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Gly-Val (SEQ ID NO: 5); Leu-Arg-Ile-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ile-Leu-Val (SEQ ID NO: 6); and Leu-Arg-Leu-Leu-Leu-Lys-Val (SEQ ID NO: 7). The sequences are predicated on the sequence of a transmembrane sequence of TCR-α. There is no support in this application that the peptides have a beneficial effect on extending transplantation lifetimes.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      Cytomodulating peptides are provided which are capable of (1) modulating the activity of various immune system cells, particularly lymphocytic cells, more particularly CTLs, (2) inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines by cells capable of producing such cytokines, thereby being effective in the treatment of conditions associated with adverse inflammatory reactions, (3) modulating the activity of heme-containing enzymes and/or (4) delaying the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in a host susceptible of having IDDM, where the peptides are based upon a design in accordance with a computer program. Exemplary of the compounds are oligopeptides comprising the sequence B-X-X-X-B-X-X-X-J-Tyr (SEQ ID NO: 8), where B is a basic amino acid, J is Gly, B, or an aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid of from 5-6 carbon atoms and X is any amino acid other than an aliphatic polar amino acid, where at least three Xs are the same aliphatic non-polar amino acid, dimers thereof and D-stereoisomers thereof, and wherein the amino acid sequence may be part of a ring. The peptides find use for inhibiting the activation of immune system lymphocytes, particularly cytotoxic lymphocytes, either by themselves or in conjunction with other immunosuppressant agents, particularly in extending the lifetime of transplants. The peptides described herein also find use for inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-γ, IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, MIP1α, etc.), thereby being useful for inhibiting inflammatory responses associated with various disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, septic shock, Crohn's disease, colitis, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases, and the like, for inhibiting the activity of heme-based enzymes such as heme oxygenase, nitric oxide synthase, etc., and delaying the onset of IDDM in a patient at risk for developing IDDM, both in vitro and in vivo. Administration of the peptides may be ex vivo of an organ to be transplanted or in vivo by any convenient means, including by direct application or administration of the peptide or nucleic acid encoding the desired peptide, in sufficient amount to substantially inhibit lymphocytic activation, inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines and the associated inflammatory process, inhibit heme-based enzyme activity, an activity that has been previously associated with inflammatory responses and/or delaying the onset of IDDM.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002698822,"BACKGROUND
      Manufacturing of large scale or commercial quantities of therapeutically useful targeted biomaterials, such as proteins, can be accomplished by growing cells that are engineered to produce a desired protein in bioreactors under controlled conditions. The technology used involves, for example, the fermentation of microorganisms which have been altered through recombinant DNA techniques or the culturing of mammalian cells which have been altered through hybridoma techniques. The cells are suspended in a broth which contains the salts, sugars, proteins, and various factors necessary to support the growth of particular cells. The desired product may be either secreted by the cells into the broth or retained within the cell body. The harvested broth is then processed to recover, purify, and concentrate the desired product.
      The separation, or purification, of these targeted biomaterials from a heterogeneous mixture has proven to be a formidable task for at least the following reasons: the desired product often represents a small percentage of total cell culture fluid, which comprises significant quantities of particulate and soluble contaminants, and the cell culture fluid can comprise high salt concentrations.
      As a result of these factors, extensive downstream processing has been necessarily used to yield high quantities of purified product. Such downstream processing includes the many stages of processing that take place subsequent to the production of the targeted biomaterial including, for example, centrifugation, cell disruption, mechanical sieving, microfiltration, ion-exchange, cross-flow filtration, affinity separation, sterilization, purification, and packaging. The downstream processing represents a major cost in the production of bioprocessed products.
      Various filtration articles have been described for the purification or separation of targeted biomaterials from fluid mixtures. U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2011/0207196 (Koehler et al.) describes a depth filter layer with an inorganic double hydroxide layer for retaining contaminants such as DNA, while proteins of biotechnological processes are transmissible therethrough. U.S. Pat. No. 5,567,615 (Degen et al.) describes an affinity separation method involving dynamic filtration said to be particularly useful in the isolation of biologically active compounds. U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2012/0252091 (Rasmussen et al.) describes a substrate grafted with a polymer that has affinity for binding neutral or negatively charged biomaterials.
SUMMARY
","SUMMARY
      There is a desire for filtration media to increase the cost efficiency of isolation and/or purification of biomaterials from fluid samples. Such efficiency may be in the form of increased throughput, due to the reduction of process steps, increased throughput of a single step, and/or better removal of contaminants resulting in reduced loading of impurities onto downstream purification devices (such as chromatography columns or filters).
      In one aspect, a filtration medium sequence is described comprising:
(i) a first filtration medium comprising an anion exchange nonwoven substrate, wherein the anion exchange nonwoven substrate comprises a plurality of quaternary ammonium groups; and
(ii) a second filtration medium comprising a functionalized microporous membrane wherein the functionalized microporous membrane comprises a plurality of guanidyl groups;
(i) a first filtration medium comprising an anion exchange nonwoven substrate, wherein the anion exchange nonwoven substrate comprises a plurality of quaternary ammonium groups; and
(ii) a second filtration medium comprising a functionalized microporous membrane wherein the functionalized microporous membrane comprises a plurality of guanidyl groups;
      wherein the first filtration medium is positioned upstream of the second filtration medium.

0002647467,"BACKGROUND ART
      Acute myocardial infarction which results in the necrosis of cardiac muscle due to coronary artery occlusion is a disease with poor prognosis and is the main underlying condition for heart diseases which are the second cause of death in Japan. Existing therapies, acute phase catheterization and coronary artery bypass surgery, alleviate myocardial damage and contribute to the reduction of mortality rate; however, there are problems such as myocardial damage that occurs when the blocked coronary blood flow restarts (ischemia-reperfusion injury). Thus, development of further therapies is desired.
      Recently, in basic experiments using animal models, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation has been reported to suppress the development of myocardial infarction via regeneration of cardiac muscle by direct differentiation of the transplanted cells into constituent cardiac muscle cells, and also via suppression of left ventricular remodeling caused by the paracrine effect of the produced cytokines. Currently, clinical trials of autologous cell transplantations via various administration routes are being carried out. However, many issues remain to be resolved as problems concerning autologous cell transplantation, such as physical burden imposed at cell collection, cost and manpower involved in cell culturing, and the time required until cell transplantation. Meanwhile, it has been recently confirmed that a mechanism exists in which damaged tissue releases factors that recruit bone marrow pluripotent stem cells into blood to induce tissue regeneration at the damaged site. Tissue regeneration that uses the mechanism of inducing regeneration of damaged tissue in vivo by administering bone marrow stem cell-inducing factors is a non-conventional novel concept in regenerative therapy, and is believed to be advantageous compared to cell therapy that uses stem cells in that manpower is not required, stable supply is possible, and administration at an early stage of damage is possible.
      In previous studies, the present inventors have identified the HMGB1 protein as a novel factor that mobilizes bone marrow pluripotent stem cells. HMGB1 is the major component of non-histone nuclear protein and is extracellularly released from dendritic cells, macrophages, or necrotic cells that accumulate in damaged sites, and is confirmed to be associated with various diseases.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problems to be Solved by the Invention
      Recently, in diseases such as cerebral infarction, it has been confirmed that a mechanism exists in which damaged tissue induces tissue regeneration at the damaged site by releasing factors that mobilize bone marrow pluripotent stem cells into blood, and that the mechanism contributes to the prevention of further expansion of the damage. In the present invention, the present inventors aimed to develop novel therapeutic agents for myocardial infarction using fragment peptides derived from an HMGB1 protein, which was identified as a new bone marrow pluripotent stem cell mobilizing factor.
Means for Solving the Problems
      The present inventors prepared a fragment peptide (1-44) of an HMGB1 protein which has a cell migration activity, and revealed in the myocardial infarction model for the first time that systemic administration of the fragment peptide enhances the accumulation of PDGFRα-positive cells in infarction sites and vicinities thereof. Further, long-standing improvement of the heart function was demonstrated in the myocardial infarction model animals administered with the fragment peptide (1-44). The above suggests that the fragment peptide (1-44) induces tissue regeneration by making use of the mechanism of inducing damaged tissue regeneration in vivo, and suppresses the development of acute myocardial infarction. Thus, it is shown that the fragment peptide of the present invention can be a useful therapeutic agent for poor-prognosis human acute myocardial infarction.
      The present invention discloses novel pharmaceutical compositions for treating myocardial infarction comprising an HMGB1 fragment peptide, and uses thereof.
      Specifically, the present inventors produced a peptide consisting of amino acids at positions 1 to 44 of an HMGB1 protein (SEQ ID NO: 3) by peptide synthesis. To model mice that enable evaluation of the therapeutic effect on myocardial infarction, each of the produced HMGB1 fragments was administered, and the therapeutic effects of the fragments on myocardial infarction were confirmed.
      Based on these findings, the present application provides the following invention:

[2] the pharmaceutical composition of [1], wherein the HMGB1 fragment peptide is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3;

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002730871,"BACKGROUND ART
      A vaccine which is a medicine for infectious disease or cancer utilizes an antigen-specific immune response. An adjuvant is a compound having an immunostimulatory activity which is used to enhance efficacy or durability of a vaccine, and various kinds of adjuvants such as aluminum salt, emulsion and liposome have been researched or developed (Non-patent Document 1 or the like).
      A single-strand oligodeoxynucleotide comprising a dinucleotide motif of unmethylated cytosine guanine (5′-CpG-3′) (ssCpG ODN) is known as a one of the adjuvants. ssCpG ODNs are ligands of TLR9 (Toll-like receptor 9), and extremely efficient inducers of Th1 immunity or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses thorough TLR9 to stimulate the immune system (Non-patent Document 1). However, there are problems related to in vivo stability, toxicity, pharmacokinetics or the like of ssCpG ODNs to use alone. A method that ssCpG ODN is encapsulated in a nanoparticle made of lipid bilayer (Non-patent Document 2), a method that lipid binds to 5′ end of ssCpG ODN (Non-patent Document 3 or Patent Document 1) or the like is known as means for solving these problems.
      Furthermore, it is known that the charactericity as an adjuvant was vanished when ssCpG ODN was administered as a double-stranded DNA (dsCpG ODN) by annealing the first strand and the second strand (Non-patent Document 4). Non-patent Document 5 discloses that only dsCpG ODN did not show the immunostimulatory activity, but when dsCpG ODN was encapsulated in a lipofectin particle, the dsCpG ODN comprising either CpG motif or GpC motif showed the immunostimulatory activity.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problems to be Solved by the Invention
      The purpose of the present invention is to provide new nucleic acid derivatives having immunostimulatory activity which are useful as an adjuvant of a vaccine and/or a vaccine itself.
Means for Solving the Problem
      Non-patent Documents 4 and 5 disclose that administering dsCpG ODN did not show the immunostimulatory activity. Furthermore, Non-patent Document 5 discloses that when dsCpG ODN was encapsulated in a lipofectin particle, the dsCpG ODN comprising either CpG motif (ODN4531) or GpC motif (ODN4531GC) induced IL-8 and HLR-DRA expression, that is, by a method which is independent of a CG sequence. It suggested based on the fact that dsCpG ODN was rapidly degraded in cells compared to ssCpG ODN that the reason why dsCpG ODN encapsulated in a lipofectin particle showed immunostimulatory activity is that encapsulation of dsCpG ODN may protect against rapid degradation (page 167, the right column, lines 10 to 16).
      The present inventors have intensively studied to synthesize a double-stranded oligonucleotide (a lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotide of the present invention) wherein a first strand is a CpG oligonucleotide, and a second strand is an oligonucleotide comprising a sequence capable of hybridizing with the first strand and binds to a lipid. They found that the inducibility of antigen-specific CTL by a vaccine was enhanced and showed the anti-tumor effect by administering a lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotide of the present invention as an adjuvant with a tumor antigen peptide (when a lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotide of the present invention is used as an adjuvant, it is also referred as “an adjuvant of the present invention”). In addition, they found that there is a lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotide in the present invention which shows strong anti-tumor effect by itself, that is, which is useful as a cancer vaccine (when a lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotide of the present invention is used as a vaccine, it is also referred as “a vaccine of the present invention”). That is, a lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotide of the present invention has the immunostimulatory activity. Furthermore, lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotides of the present invention have high metabolic stability, water solubility and less toxicity to be safe enough as a medicine.
      For example, when an adjuvant of the present invention wherein the second strand is a DNA oligonucleotide, an oligonucleotide consisting of nucleoside derivatives having OMe at the 2′ position of the sugar or an oligonucleotide consisting of nucleoside derivatives having F at the 2′ position of the sugar was administered with a tumor antigen peptide, they showed the enhanced CTL inducibility or the strong anti-tumor effect compared to ssCpG ODN (e.g., Result 1-A, B, Result 7-A, B and Result 9-A, B in Example 3). On the other hand, the lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotide wherein the second strand is a RNA oligonucleotide (SEQ-40) did not show the anti-tumor effect (Result 7-B).
      When an adjuvant of the present invention wherein a lipid comprising two of the acyl chains having 14 to 24 carbon atoms binds at 3′ or 5′ end of the second strand was administered with a tumor antigen peptide, it showed the strong anti-tumor effect compared to ssCpG ODN (e.g., Result 2-A, B in Example 3). On the other hand, when a double-stranded oligonucleotide wherein a lipid comprising two acyl chains having 10 carbon atoms binds at 5′ end of the second strand (SEQ-12) was administered with a tumor antigen peptide, it did not show the enhanced anti-tumor effect compared to ssCpG ODN. In addition, when an adjuvant of the present invention wherein a lipid comprising two of the acyl chains having 12 to 20 carbon atoms binds at 3′ or 5′ end of the second strand, and furthermore a lipid binds at the other end was administered with a tumor antigen peptide, it showed the enhanced CTL inducibility or the strong anti-tumor effect compared to ssCpG ODN (e.g., Result 3-A, B in Example 3).
      When an adjuvant of the present invention wherein the length of the second strand is 50% to 100% of that of the first strand (the CpG oligonucleotide) was administered with a tumor antigen peptide, it showed the enhanced CTL inducibility or the strong anti-tumor effect compared to ssCpG ODN (e.g., Result 4-A, B, Result 5-A, Result 8-A, B, and Result 9-A, B in Example 3).
      When an adjuvant of the present invention wherein a lipid binds to a second strand through an oligonucleotide linker (e.g., dGdG, dTdT and dAdA) was administered with a tumor antigen peptide, it showed the further enhanced CTL inducibility or the stronger anti-tumor effect compared to an adjuvant of the present invention without a linker (e.g., Result 8-A, B in Example 3).
      In addition, lipid binding double-stranded oligonucleotides of the present invention have no systemic toxicity, and it suggested the high safety (Example 5).
      Furthermore, the result of immunization with an adjuvant of the present invention and PCRV protein derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is a cause of an infectious disease also suggested the immunostimulatory activity as an adjuvant of a vaccine for an infectious disease (Example 6).
      When the adjuvant of the present invention wherein lipid binds to a second strand through an oligonucleotide linker (dGdGdGdGdG) (SEQ-121) was administered alone, it showed the strong antitumor effect compared to ssCpG ODN (Example 4).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002597971,"BACKGROUND ART
      Cancer is the leading cause of death. Currently conducted therapy comprises mainly surgical therapy in combination with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In spite of the development of new operative procedures and the discovery of new anticancer agents in recent years, cancer treatment results have not been much improved recently, excluding that for some types of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biology or cancer immunology lead to identification of antibodies specifically reacting with cancer, cancer antigens to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells, genes encoding cancer antigens, and the like. Demands on specific cancer therapies targeting cancer antigens are increasing (Non-patent Literature 1).
      In cancer therapy, it is desirable that peptides, polypeptides, or proteins recognized as antigens be almost absent in normal cells, but they be present specifically in cancer cells, in order to alleviate side effects. In 1991, Boon et al., (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Belgium) isolated a human melanoma antigen MAGE1 recognized by CD8-positive T cells by the cDNA expression cloning method using autologous cancer cell lines and cancer-reactive T cells (Non-patent Literature 2). Thereafter, the SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) method that comprises identifying tumor antigens recognized by antibodies that are produced in vivo in response to autologous cancer of a cancer patient by gene expression cloning techniques was reported (Non-patent Literature 3 and Patent Literature 1). With the use of this method, some cancer antigens, which are almost never expressed in normal cells but are specifically expressed in cancer cells, were isolated (Non-patent Literatures 4-9). Furthermore, clinical trials were conducted with cell therapies targeting some cancer antigens using immunocytes specifically reactive with cancer antigens, or cancer-specific immunotherapies using vaccines or the like containing cancer antigens.
      Meanwhile, in recent years, various antibody medicines which target antigenic proteins on cancer cells for cancer treatment have appeared throughout the world. Antibody medicines exhibit some pharmacological effects as cancer specific therapeutic agents and are thus attracting attention. However, most antigen proteins to be targeted are also expressed in normal cells, so that not only cancer cells, but also normal cells expressing antigens are also damaged as a result of antibody administration. The resulting side effects cause for concern. Therefore, it is expected that identification of cancer antigens that are specifically expressed on the surface of a cancer cell and use of antibodies targeting the cancer antigens as pharmaceuticals will realize treatment with antibody medicines with lower side effects.
      Cytoplasmic- and proliferation-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN-1) is expressed when normal cells at the resting phase are activated or undergo cell division, and it is an intracellular protein known to form intracellular stress granules with RNA within cells, so as to be involved in mRNA transport and translational regulation. Meanwhile, many other names that represent CAPRIN-1 exist, such as GPI-anchored membrane protein 1 or membrane component surface marker 1 protein (M11S1), as if such proteins had been known to be cell membrane proteins. These names originated from a report that the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 is a membrane protein having a GPI-binding region and expressed in colorectal cancer cells (Non-patent Literature 10). However, the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 provided in this report was later revealed to be wrong. The following has recently been reported; i.e., deletion of a single nucleotide in the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like causes a frame shift, so that 80 amino acids are lost from the C-terminus, resulting in generation of an artifact (74 amino acids) which corresponds to the GPI-binding portion in the previous report, and additionally, another error is also present 5′ of the gene sequence, so that 53 amino acids were lost from the N-terminus (Non-patent Literature 11). It has been also recently reported that the protein encoded by the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like is not a cell membrane protein (Non-patent Literature 11).
      In addition, on the basis of the report of Non-patent Literature 10 that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein, Patent Literatures 2 and 3 describe that CAPRIN-1 (as a cell membrane protein) under the name of M11S1 can be used as a target of an antibody medicine in cancer therapy, although working examples do not describe treatment using an antibody against the protein. However, as reported in Non-patent Literature 11, it has been commonly believed from the time of the filing of Patent Literature 2 to date that CAPRIN-1 is not expressed on the surface of a cell. The contents of Patent Literatures 2 and 3 based only on incorrect information that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein should not clearly be understood as common general knowledge for persons skilled in the art.

      As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have now obtained a cDNA encoding a protein that binds to an antibody existing in sera from dogs with breast cancer by the SEREX method using both cDNA libraries prepared from dog testis tissues and sera of dogs with breast cancer. The present inventors have now further prepared CAPRIN-1 proteins having the even-numbered amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 2 to 30 and antibodies against such CAPRIN-1 proteins based on the obtained dog gene and the corresponding human, cattle, horse, mouse, and chicken homologous genes.

On the basis of these findings, the present invention as described below was completed.

      In an embodiment, the above cancer is breast cancer, brain tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer, uterine cervix cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, renal cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, or fibrosarcoma.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002527892,"BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION
      In the past decade, our concept of what conditions are compatible with life, have changed significantly. The earlier, anthropocentric view of nature has limited our capacity to access new microbes and their genomes, but the discovery that almost all environments on earth and even the subsurface (more than 4 km), or subzero temperatures and high levels of radiation are likely to contain specially adapted life forms, has made the notion to understand the microbial biodiversity very important.
      One of the most amazing features of the microbial world is that even the most toxic and apparently recalcitrant of substances developed by (chemical) industry over the decades usually prove to be degradable by one micro-organism or another. Microorganisms can encounter a large variety of chemicals such as metals in contaminated environments, thus it is not surprising that they would interact with these metals (Nies and Sliver, 1995).
      U (VI) resistant bacteria isolated from contaminated environments have been shown to possess the ability to successfully remove toxic U (VI) from the environment by either reduction (generally by bacteria) or biosorption (usually by fungi) (van Heerden et al., 2008).
      Recently, the microbial reduction of metals has attracted interest as these transformations can play crucial roles in the cycling of both inorganic and organic species and therefore have opened up new and exciting areas of research with potential practical application (Anderson et al., 1998; Rooney-Varga et al., 1999; Lovley and Lloyd, 2000; Anderson et al., 2003; Lovley et al., 2004). Dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria (DMRB) have been shown to gain energy to support anaerobic growth by coupling the oxidation of H 2 or organic matter to the reduction of a variety of multivalent metals. This metabolism can lead to the complete mineralization of organic matter or to the precipitation and immobilization of metal contaminants under anaerobic conditions (Sani et al., 2002).
      For the bioremediation of uranium contaminated sites, the chemistry of the element offers an approach that has received much attention in the last 20 years. The oxidation state of uranium is crucial to its stability, mobility and bioavailability. The oxidized or hexavalent, (VI), state of uranium is highly soluble and therefore mobile, while the reduced or tetravalent, (IV), state is relatively insoluble. In waste, uranium is present primarily as soluble salts of the uranyl ion (UO 2 2+). When the uranyl ion is reduced from the U (VI) oxidation state to a lower oxidation state such as U (IV), the solubility decreases and it becomes immobilized.
      The list of bacteria known in the art to reduce U (VI) is growing. When Thermus scotoductus SA-01 is incubated anaerobically with U (VI), U (VI) will precipitate out of solution indicating that Thermus scotoductus SA-01 has the ability to reduce U (VI). Studies have also shown that Thermus scotoductus SA-01 has the ability to reduce almost 100% of a 0.25 mM U (VI) solution under anaerobic conditions with lactate as an electron donor in less than 30 hours (van Heerden et al., 2008).
      However, very little is known about the mechanisms involved in U (VI) reduction and the proteins involved in these mechanisms and accordingly conclusive evidence as to which protein(s) are responsible for uranium reduction is still lacking.
      For purposes of the present specification, “polypeptide” is understood as meaning peptides or proteins which comprise two or more amino acids bonded via peptide bonds.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      According to a first aspect thereof, the present invention provides an isolated polypeptide derived from Thermus scotoductus strain SA-01 that is responsible for the reduction of uranium (VI), in a source of uranium (VI), to uranium (IV), wherein the polypeptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No: 1.
      The isolated polypeptide is characterized in that it is a homogenous protein, having a molecular mass of 70 kDa, as shown by SDS-PAGE gel analysis.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02361877,"BACKGROUND ART
      The RA is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology that affects approximately 1% of world's population. It is a syndrome characterized by chronic inflammation of the joints, although systemic manifestations can be also observed. This illness begins with the inflammation of the synovial membrane and frequently causes the erosive destruction of the adjacent cartilage and the bone, which result in moderate physical inability of 80% of the patients and an early mortality (Moctezuma, J. F. (2002) Manifestaciones articulares de la Artritis Reumatide. Revista Mexicana de Reumatologia 17:211-219). RA can be presented at any age, without distinctions of races or ethnic groups, but the maximum incidence of its beginning happens between 25 and 55 years old. Among people with RA, the women overcome the men in a proportion from three to one (Emery, P. (2002) Early referral recommendation for newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis: evidence based development of to clinical guide. Ann Rheum Dis. 61:290-297). The cause of RA is unknown. It is an illness that involves the presence of genetic, environmental, immunological and hormonal factors. Certain genes have a role in the immune system, associated with a tendency to develop RA. At the same time, some people with RA don't have these genes and other people having them never develop the illness. Therefore, it has been suggested that the genetic background is important but it is not decisive.
      In models of autoimmune disease, microbial antigens with similar structure to own antigens can release a crossed response to autoantigens, producing an alteration in the mechanisms of tolerance and perpetuating an autoimmune response. In general sense, the damage and local necrosis in a tissue produced by an infectious agent could discover the autoantigen cryptic epitope, being able to activate autoreactivate T cells (Albert, L. J. (1999) Mechanisms of Disease: Molecular Mimicry and autoimmunity. N Engl J Med 341:2068-2074)
      The phase of transition of T lymphocyte between tolerance and immunity/autoimmunity is regulated at different levels. Two important parameters in this transition are the state of maturation of the Antigen Presenting Cells (abbreviated APC) and the levels of autoantigens that are detected by the immune system (Ohashi, P. S. (2002) Making and breaking tolerance. Current Opinion in Immmunology 14:744-759).
      One of the current hypotheses that tries to explain the development of autoimmune diseases, outlines that APC in absence of signs of the innate immune system or of signs of danger, remain relatively immature and induce tolerance in autoreactive T cells, when own peptides are presented to them (Steiman, R. M. (2000) The induction of tolerance by dendritic cells that have captured apoptotic cells. J Exp Med. 191:411-416). The induction of peripheral tolerance is also correlated with the concentration of own antigen (Kurts, C. (1999) CD8 T cell ignorance or tolerance to islet antigens depends on antigen dose. PNAS 96:12703-12707). An increment in the presentation of own antigens due to the increment of their expression levels, allows their detection by autoreactive ignorant T cells. If levels of own antigens are increased in absence of events that promote the maturation of APC, the tolerance to these antigens is maintained, otherwise, it happens in presence of proinflammatory signs or other events that promote the maturation of the APC, the tolerance is breaks by activation of the ignorant T cells and autoimmune diseases are developed (Janeway, C. A. (2002) Innate immune recognition. Annu Rev Immunol. 20:197-216). The infectious agents that have been object of study like cause of RA are: Epstein Bar virus, the retrovirus, virus of the hepatitis C, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (abbreviated Mt) and the Helicobacter pylori, among others.
      The pathogenesis of RA is characterized by the concerted action of different types of cells that cause the progressive destruction of the cartilage and the bone. In normal situations a balance exists among the inflammatory cytokine as: TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18 and the IFNγ, and the anti-inflammatory ones as IL-4, IL-11, IL-13 and antagonistic of IL-1 or TNFα. In the RA this balance moves however in favor of the inflammatory cytokines (Arend, W. P. (2001) Cytokine imbalance in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis: The role of interleukin-1 receiving antagonist. Semin Arthritis Rheum 30(2):1-6)
      The recognition of an exogenous antigen or autoantigen is probably the reason of a series of events that cause destruction of the joints in patients with RA. This phenomenon cause the activation of T CD4+ lymphocytes that in cooperation with the stimulation of different cytokines, induces their differentiation to cells Th1 with the consequent liberation of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2 and INFγ) (Simón, A. J. (2001) Biological therapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis. Magazine of Clinical Investigation 53(5):452-459). Many investigators coincide that the chronic inflammation of the joints is induced by these activated T cells that infiltrate the synovial membrane. The action of these cytokines on macrophages causes the production of high amount of TNFα and IL-1. These cause a series of local and systemic actions as regulating the expression of the molecules of adhesion in the endothelial cells (LFA1, ICAM-1), which recruit other cells to the inflammation sites. They also stimulate macrophages, fibroblasts, condrocytes and osteoclasts to the liberation of others mediators of the inflammation, as IL-15 and IL-8. TNFα and IL-1 stimulate the proliferation of the synovial membrane that causes formation of pannus, they can also induce the differentiation of B lymphocytes to cells producing antibodies that potentially participate in the destruction of the joint. They also inhibit the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-14) produced by Th2 cells and stimulate hepatocytes to liberate IL-6. IL-6 favors the production of the proteins of the acute phase, which participate strengthening the immune response (Forre, O. (2000) New possibilities of treatment in AR. Scand J Rheumatol 29(2):73-84).
      Among autoantigens involved in the pathogenesis of RA is Hsp60, a protein that belongs to the family of the Hsp, which are immunogenic proteins with exceptionally evolutionary conservation. The immune response against the strange Hsp is an important mechanism of defense against bacterial infections. The antibodies against these proteins can be abundant in healthy people and in patient with autoimmune illnesses and they can cross react with the own antigens (Chen, W. (1999) Human 60-kDa Heat-Shock Protein: To Danger Signal to the Innate Immune System. J. Immunol. 162:3212-3219).
      The Hsp65 of Mt is homologous to the Hsp60 of the mammals. This suggests that the Hsp60 can be recognized as autoantigen in patient with RA. Comparing patients with osteoarthritis and patients with RA, these last ones have an increase of prolipherative response of B lymphocytes in the synovial liquid to the Hsp65 of mycobacterium. The intensity of the response correlates with the synovial inflammation. This response is not specific for RA compared with other inflammatory illnesses (Life, P. (1993) Responses to Gram negative enteric bacterial antigens by synovial T cells from patiens with juvenile chronic arthritis: recognition of heat shock protein hsp60. J. Rheumatol. 20:1388-1396).
      The concentration of Hsp is a possible sign of danger for the immune system, which are released from dead cells, and can induce an inflammatory response and to begin the maturation of the APC. The Hsp, are intracellular proteins, which are not expressed in the cellular membrane, neither are secreted, so that the Hsp are attractive candidates for molecules that constitute signs of danger (Van den Berg, W B. (1998): Joint inflammation and cartilage destruction may occur uncoupled. Springer Semin Immunopathol. 20:149-164).
      Several preparations have been proposed using the Hsp60 or its derived peptides for the treatment of some autoimmune pathologies. For example in the patent EP0262710, the use of several peptides of the Hsp60 of Mt is proposed for the treatment and diagnosis of autoimmune illnesses, especially of arthritic conditions. This invention is based on the fact that previous infections with several bacteria can trigger the development of autoimmune illnesses, in genetically susceptible people, for example: patients with RA can show a high reactivity to microbial antigens. These same inventors in the patent EP0322990 propose the use of others peptides of the Hsp60 of Mt with the same purpose of the previous patent.
      In the patent application WO9610039 they intend the use of a peptide of the Hsp60 of Mt for the diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune arthritis. In the patent application WO9711966, the authors intend the use of peptides of non conserved regions of the hHsp60, that don't coincide with the Hsp60 of bacteria that could induce tolerance in T cells of patients with RA.
      The patent application WO0143691 proposes the use of pharmaceutical preparations composed specifically by peptides of the hHsp60 and their variants for the prevention of inflammatory illnesses such as RA.
      In the U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,103 the authors intend the use of a peptide of the Hsp60 called p277 and its analogous for the diagnosis and prevention of the diabetes type I.
      The U.S. Pat. No. 5,993,803 protects the use of the Hsp60, the peptide p277 and a group of derived peptides of this protein to reduce the severity of the immune response during the transplant of organs.
      Recently it has been considered that the atherosclerosis presents a series of similar characteristics to autoimmune processes. In the patent application WO0072023 the authors purpose a method for the treatment and diagnosis of the atherosclerosis and coronary illnesses using a preparation that contains the protein Hsp60.
      In the patent application WO02057795, a new method is protected for the diagnosis and treatment of the osteoporosis using proteins of the family of Hsp and proteins from pathogens such as: viruses and bacteria.
      At the present time, cure doesn't exist for the RA. The current methods of treatment are centered in alleviating the pain, to reduce the inflammation, to retard the damages of the joints and to improve the functions and the well-being of the patients. Recently immunomodulating medications have been elaborated, that blocks cytokines that participate in the beginning and maintenance of the inflammatory response in RA, with the purpose to stop or slow the progression of the illness. For this kind of therapy two types of medications exist: blocking the action of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (abbreviated TNFa) and those that inhibit the action of the interleukin 1 (IL-1).
      Although the results are promissory with the therapies anti-TNFa and anti-IL-1, the percentage of infections is high. Many of treated patients with these drugs develop serious infections that are fatal in some cases; including other autoimmune illnesses, neoplasias, etc. Besides, they are very expensive medications (Breshinan, B. (1998) Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with recombinant human anti-interleukin-1 antagonist. Arthritis Reum. 41:2196-2204)
      Oral tolerance has been proposed as a method of creating peripheral tolerance in front of certain antigens. This can be induced by mechanisms of active suppression, anergy or clonal deletion, depending on the doses and the frequency of the administration of the antigen. The method can induce regulatory T cells that are activated in a specific way by the antigen, but exert its action independently (active suppression). For the regulatory action takes place, it is not necessary to administer the supposedly pathogenic antigen, but any other able to induce the active suppression in the inflammatory focus, inhibiting the activity of the pathogenic effector cells. Collagen type II (abbreviated CII) is the autoantigen that has been used more frequently in this sense. The results of the studies carried out in patients with RA, using chicken and bovine CII have given contradictory results (Trentham, D. E. (1993) Effects of oral administration of type II collagen in rheumatoid arthritis. Science 261:1727-1730; Sieper, J. (1996) Oral type II collagen treatment in early rheumatoid arthritis: to double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomize trial. Arthritis Rheum. 39:41-51).
      The U.S. Pat. No. 6,153,200 intends the use of a peptide of the Hsp70, protein belonging to the family of Hsp, to induce tolerance for oral route in patients with RA. Another variant that has been suggested to induce tolerance is through APL peptides, based on the fact that T cells are activated if the specific T CD4+ lymphocytes for a certain antigenic peptide recognize the antigen presented by competent APC. Nevertheless, if the same T cell is first activated with a different form from the antigen, in which one of the contact sites with the TcR are lightly altered, it can result in a partial activation or even inactivation of the T cells. These antigens are named APLs. The APLs are similar to immunogenic peptides with one or several substitutions in the essential positions of contact with the TcR or with MHC that interfere the cascade of necessary events for the complete activation of the T cells.
      Conceptually, APLs can be designed with similar properties to the immunogenic peptide (agonist) among other effects for increasing the response of T cells toward specific antigens. This effect is advantageous under pathological conditions as infectious illnesses. Peptides can also be designed with antagonistic properties to the immunogenic peptide that could be beneficial in the control of autoimmune illnesses since they can block the response of T cells acting as antagonistic of the TcR (M. De Magistris (1992) Antigen analog-major complex histocompatibility complexes act as antagonist of the T cell receptor. Cell 68:625-634), partial agonist or inducing a population of regulatory T cells that mediate the active suppression (Evavold, B. D. (1991) Separation of IL-4 production from Th cell proliferation by an altered T cell ligand. Science 252:1308-1310). The capacity to experimentally manipulate the intrinsic properties of peptide ligands allows altering the nature, the course and the power of the immune cellular response appropriately.
      Up to this moment, two clinical trials in humans using type APL peptides have been performed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In both assays, the peptides are derived from an epitope in position 83 to 93 of the myelin basic protein. One of these trials included 142 patients with multiple sclerosis, and it was suspended because 9% of the patients developed hypersensitivity (Ludwig Kapposi (2000) Induction of non-encephalitogenic type 2 T helper-cell autoimmune response in multiple sclerosis after administration of an altered peptide ligand in to placebo controlled, randomized phase II trial. Nature Medicine 10:1176-1182).
      The other trial included 25 patients and was also interrupted, because in three patients was observed an exacerbation of the illness (Bibiana Bielekova (2000) Encephalitogenic potential of the myelin basic protein peptide (amino acids 83-99) in multiple sclerosis: Results of to phase II clinical trial with an altered peptide ligand. Nature Medicine 6:1167-1175). The main author of this work analyzes the possible factors that determined these negative results, and outlines that the changes carried out in the APL's sites may originate new motifs of union to the HLA (like it happened in the case of the APL binding to DRB1*0404 present in patient I), the complex APL-HLA can also stimulate T cells not eliminated in the negative selection that can be cross-activated by the native autoantigen. In this trial high concentrations of the APL were used in the pharmaceutical preparations, which can stimulate T cells with high similarity for the autoantigen and to induce a heteroclitic T cells response. (Bibiana Bielekova and Roland Martin (2001) Antigen-specific immunomodulation via altered peptide tying. J Mol Med. 79:552-556).
      For carrying out these two clinical trials, the authors didn't previously analyze the in vitro response of the T cells from the patients to the APL. They also did not consider the types of HLA molecules expressed by the treated patients
      The main challenge in the treatment of the autoimmune diseases is the development of therapeutic strategies that can eliminate pathogenic T cells with specificity, without affecting other non related T cells. Therefore, therapeutic search should find a secure, specific and effective way of turning off an advanced autoimmune process.
      The present invention, in contrast to the state of the previous technique, proposes the use of peptides of the hHsp60 and its derived type APL, which induce inhibitory molecular mechanisms, in a specific way, of the course of RA.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
","SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
      The present invention solves the problem previously mentioned, providing peptides of the human protein of heat shock of 60 kDa that constitute epitopes for T cells, to induce mechanisms of tolerance, in particular anergy induction mechanisms or mediated by clones of regulatory T cells in patients with RA and that present the sequences.

      The patent application WO9711966, intends the use of peptides of the hHsp60 and of Mt based on the fact that they could induce tolerance in T cells and to prevent the RA. These authors corroborate certain improvement of the illness by administering these peptides to mice (Arthritis was previously induced with pristine). Contrary to this application, we have demonstrated that our peptides induce mechanisms of active suppression which induce peripheral tolerance in a very efficient way, corroborating a significant increase of IL-10 in two animal models of Arthritis, as well as in “ex vivo” assays using mononuclear cells of patients.
      It is well known that fundamental response of T cells in the model of adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) is directed against the Hsp60. We checked in this model that our derived peptides of the hHsp60 exert a very marked therapeutic protection, producing an increase of the IL-10 and a decrease of TNFα levels. The same therapeutic effect exerted by these peptides, we have also checked in the animal model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), where the major response is against the type II collagen.
      These facts indicate that therapeutic capacities of our peptides are independent of the induction agent and can mediate mechanisms of active suppression in the site of inflammation that could be extended to other autoantigens present in joints, which progressively contribute to the immunopathogenic process that takes place during the course of RA. These results reinforce the therapeutic possibilities of the use of our preparations for the treatment of RA.
      These peptides are in particular useful, according to the present invention, for the design of derived type APL variants of the peptides E18-12 (SEQ. ID. NO: 1) and E18-3 (SEQ. ID. NO: 2), modified in the contact sites with the human MHC molecule and a derived type APL of the peptide F19-6 (SEQ. ID. NO: 3), modified in the contact sites with the rat MHC molecule. The respective sequences of amino acids are:
position 1 is substituted by H.
position 2 is substituted by E.
      In a particular carrying out, derived type APL peptides have amino acid sequence selected from the group that consists of SEQ. ID. NO: 4, SEQ. ID. NO: 5, SEQ. ID. NO: 6, SEQ. ID. NO: 7, SEQ. ID. NO: 8, SEQ. ID. NO: 9, SEQ. ID. NO: 10, SEQ. ID. NO: 11, SEQ. ID. NO: 12, SEQ. ID. NO: 13, SEQ. ID. NO: 14, SEQ. ID. NO: 15, SEQ. ID. NO: 16, SEQ. ID. NO: 17, SEQ. ID. NO: 18, SEQ. ID. NO: 19, SEQ. ID. NO: 20 y SEQ. ID. NO: 21.
      The peptides of the present invention can be produced by routine methods of peptide synthesis. The specific composition of each peptide can be assayed by the level and the quality of the immune response that it induces in experiments as those are described in the examples that will be presented later on.
      All the sequences described above and in the examples are useful and can also be used as a base for the design and synthesis of derived peptides with improved properties.
      The invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions that include one or more of previously enumerated peptides and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle.
      The administration of the pharmaceutical preparations to the patients will be in correspondence with the HLA class II molecules that are expressed by the specific patient.
      The way of administration of the pharmaceutical compositions will depend on the cytokines pattern that these preparations induce in the “ex vivo” tests. The pharmaceutical preparations containing APL peptides inducing a regulatory response will be administered by intradermal or subcutaneous route. The pharmaceutical preparations containing the original peptides inducing a TH1 response will be able to be administered by oral route.
      The amounts of peptides in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are those that produce an effective immune response in the host. The effective amount is the quantity that when is administered induces molecular mechanisms that significantly diminish the inflammatory signs characteristic of the RA and stop the damages in the joints characteristic of the course of this illness. The amount of the pharmaceutical composition administered to the host can also vary depending on of several factors that include: the used peptides, ACR score (American College of Rheumatology, abbreviated ACR), HLA type II, time of having diagnosed the illness, age, sex, general health, as well as the level of immunological response in general.
      The present invention also relates a method of treatment of the RA, which includes the administration to a patient of effective amounts of peptides or the pharmaceutical compositions referred previously.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
02344144,"BACKGROUND
       Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, inflammatory condition that affects peripheral joints. Collagen-induced arthritis animal models have helped define genes related to RA conditions. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene (Aq in mouse) important for the initiation and maintenance of RA conditions has been identified. This gene functionally corresponds to the HLA-DR gene DR*0401 in humans, suggesting that T cell mediated autoimmune recognition of joint specific antigens is involved in the disease.
       Genes in regions outside the MHC also have been found to be important for the initiation and maintenance of RA conditions. One of these gene regions is located on chromosome 2 in mouse and contains a gene coding for the complement factor C5. One of the active components of C5 is C5a, which is released during complement binding to immunocomplexes. The release of C5a triggers several different pathways that lead to rheumatoid inflammation. C5a produced locally in an inflammatory joint can bind to receptors on macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes, leading to infiltration of inflammatory cells into joints. C5 also plays a central role in complement-mediated processes such as sepsis, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, nephritis, and graft rejection, as well as complement-mediated inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and vasculitis.

DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
"
0002598258,"BACKGROUND ART
      Cancer is the leading cause of death. Currently conducted therapy comprises mainly surgical therapy in combination with radiation therapy and chemotherapy. In spite of the development of new operative procedures and the discovery of new anticancer agents in recent years, cancer treatment results have not been much improved recently, excluding that for some types of cancer. Recent advances in molecular biology or cancer immunology lead to identification of antibodies specifically reacting with cancer, cancer antigens to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells, genes encoding cancer antigens, and the like. Demands on specific cancer therapies targeting cancer antigens are increasing (Non-patent Literature 1).
      In cancer therapy, it is desirable that peptides, polypeptides, or proteins recognized as antigens be almost absent in normal cells, but they be present specifically in cancer cells, in order to alleviate side effects. In 1991, Boon et al., (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Belgium) isolated a human melanoma antigen MAGE1 recognized by CD8-positive T cells by the cDNA expression cloning method using autologous cancer cell lines and cancer-reactive T cells (Non-patent Literature 2). Thereafter, the SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) method that comprises identifying tumor antigens recognized by antibodies that are produced in vivo in response to autologous cancer of a cancer patient by gene expression cloning techniques was reported (Non-patent Literature 3 and Patent Literature 1). With the use of this method, some cancer antigens, which are almost not expressed in normal cells but are expressed specifically in cancer cells, were isolated (Non-patent Literatures 4-9). Furthermore, clinical trials were conducted with cell therapies targeting some cancer antigens using immunocytes specifically reactive with cancer antigens, or cancer-specific immunotherapies using vaccines or the like containing cancer antigens.
      Meanwhile, in recent years, various antibody medicines which target antigenic proteins on cancer cells for cancer treatment have appeared throughout the world. Antibody medicines exhibit some pharmacological effects as cancer specific therapeutic agents and are thus attracting attention. However, most antigen proteins to be targeted are also expressed in normal cells, so that not only cancer cells, but also normal cells expressing antigens are also damaged as a result of antibody administration. The resulting side effects are a cause for concern. Therefore, it is expected that identification of cancer antigens that are specifically expressed on the surface of a cancer cell and use of antibodies targeting the cancer antigens as pharmaceuticals will realize treatment with antibody medicines with lower side effects.
      Cytoplasmic- and proliferation-associated protein 1 (CAPRIN-1) is expressed when normal cells at the resting phase are activated or undergo cell division, and it is an intracellular protein known to form intracellular stress granules with RNA within cells, so as to be involved in mRNA transport and translational regulation. Meanwhile, many other names that represent CAPRIN-1 exist, such as GPI-anchored membrane protein 1 or membrane component surface marker 1 protein (M11S1), as if such proteins had been known to be cell membrane proteins. These names originated from a report that the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 is a membrane protein having a GPI-binding region and expressed in colorectal cancer cells (Non-patent Literature 10). However, the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 provided in this report was later revealed to be wrong. The following has recently been reported; i.e., deletion of a single nucleotide in the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like causes a frame shift, so that 80 amino acids are lost from the C-terminus, resulting in generation of an artifact (74 amino acids) which corresponds to the GPI-binding portion in the previous report, and additionally, another error is also present 5′ of the gene sequence, so that 53 amino acids were lost from the N-terminus (Non-patent Literature 11). It has been also recently reported that the protein encoded by the gene sequence of CAPRIN-1 registered at GenBank or the like is not a cell membrane protein (Non-patent Literature 11).
      In addition, on the basis of the report of Non-patent Literature 10 that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein, Patent Literatures 2 and 3 describe that CAPRIN-1 (as a cell membrane protein) under the name of M11S1 can be used as a target of an antibody medicine in cancer therapy, although working examples do not describe treatment using an antibody against the protein. However, as reported in Non-patent Literature 11, it has been commonly believed from the time of the filing of Patent Literature 2 to date that CAPRIN-1 is not expressed on the surface of a cell. The contents of Patent Literatures 2 and 3 based only on incorrect information that CAPRIN-1 is a cell membrane protein should not clearly be understood as common general knowledge for persons skilled in the art.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE"
0002589053,"BACKGROUND
      PI3K is a lipid kinase and can phosphorylate 3-position of inositol ring in phosphatidylinositol to form phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-diphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4, 5-triphosphate (PIP3). PIP, PIP2 and PIP3, as important second messengers, bind and activate various proteins containing PH domain (pleckstrin homology domain), FYVE domain (named after the first letter of Fablp, YOTB, Vaclp and EEA1 proteins containing FYVE domain found originally, see Gaullier, J. M.; Simonsen, A.; D'Arrigo, A.; Bremnes, B.; Stenmark, H., Chem. Phys. Lipids, 1999, 98: 87-94), PX domain (Phox homology domain) and other phospholipid-binding region, to form a signaling cascade complex, and ultimately regulate cell activities such as proliferation, differentiation, survival and migration etc. (see Vanhaesebroeck, B.; Leevers, S. J.; Ahmadi, K.; Timms, J.; Katso, R.; Driscoll, P. C.; Woscholski, R.; Parker, P. J.; Waterfield, M. D., Annu. Rev. Biochem., 2001, 70: 535-602).
      Depending on the differences in gene sequence, the substrate specificity and function, PI3K superfamily is grouped into three classes: I, II and III PI3K. Class I PI3Ks are most widely studied class by far. The substrates of PI3Ks are phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P), phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Class I PI3Ks are heterodimeric molecules composed of one catalytic subunit and one regulatory subunit. Class I PI3Ks can be further divided into two categories due to the difference in the regulatory subunit and activation mechanism: PI3K IA and PI3K IB. Wherein, PI3K IA comprises PI3Kα, PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ, and is actived by receptor tyrosine kinase; while PI3K IB only consists of PI3Kγ and is actived by G protein-coupled receptors. PI and PI(4)P are substrates of class II PI3Ks. Class II PI3Ks include PI3KC2α, PI3KC2β and PI3KC2γ. They are characterized by a C2 domain at the C terminus, indicating that their activities are regulated by calcium ion. The substrate of class III PI3K is PI. Its activation mechanism remains unclear up to now (see, Engelman, J. A.; Luo, J.; Cantley, L. C., Nat. Rev. Genet., 2006, 7: 606-619).
      Hyper-activation of PI3K initiates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target protein of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signal pathway and promotes cell survival and proliferation, which is frequently present in about 60% of human tumors. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) acts as a tumor suppressor and dephosphorylate 3-position at inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol and antagonize the activity of PI3K. Such function is lost in many cancers. Active mutation in gene PIK3CA encoding p110α is present in over 30% of cancers. Moreover, gene amplifications of PI3K3CA and protein kinase B (Akt) have been frequently found in other cancers which also contribute to the expression of protein (see Engelman, J. A., Nat. Rev. Cancer, 2009, 9: 550-562). These facts indicate that PI3K is closely related to the tumorigenesis and promotion. The target protein of rapamycin (mTOR) is one of important downstream protein of protein kinase B, which is a serine/threonine kinase. Protein kinase B further activates the target protein of rapamycin by directly phosphorylating mTOR; or indirectly enhancing the activation of mTOR by inactivating tumor suppressor gene TSC2 (Tuberous sclerosis protein 2). The active mTOR directly or indirectly takes part in regulations of various processes relating to cell proliferation and growth, such as the initial stage of translation, transcription, microfilament rest action, membrane transport, protein degradation, protein kinase C (PKC) pathway, ribosomal protein synthesis and tRNA synthesis etc by regulating downstream signaling pathways, such as ribosome S6 kinase (S6K1, or P70S6K), eukaryotic cells translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4 e) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), signal transduction and transcription activation factor 3 (STAT3), etc. Therefore, mTOR is a center regulatory protein of cell growth and proliferation and has become a new antitumor drug target.
      PI3K and downstream signaling protein mTOR inhibitors are a class of promising antitumor drugs. At present, several pan-PI3K inhibitors, such as GDC-0941, XL-147, PX-866, etc. have entered into clinical studies. However, the number and structure diversity need to be expanded to meet the needs of research and development of new anticancer drug. Meanwhile, there are defects existing in known inhibitors. For example, PX-866, which is derived from Wortmannin, is difficult to be synthesized; and the activity of GDC-0941 needs to be improved. Therefore, discovery and development of antitumor drugs targeting PI3K with higher activity, better safety attract increasing interest world wide.
      Pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine is a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry. After this privileged structure was reported as purine analogues (see: Hayashi, M.; Araki, A.; Maeba, I., Heterocycles, 1992, 34: 569-574. Patil, S. A.; Otter, B. A.; Klein, R. S., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 35: 5339-5342), more and more compounds containing such privileged structure were synthesized and displayed a variety of biological activities, for example, acting as JAK2 inhibitors (see: Weinberg, L. R.; Albom, M. S.; Angeles, T. S. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001, 21: 7325-7330), pan-Aurora kinase inhibitors (Abraham, S.; Hadd, M. J.; Tran, L. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett 2011, 21: 5296-5300), p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38α MAPK) inhibitors (Liu, C.; Lin, J.; Wrobleski, S. T. et al., J. Med. Chem., 2010, 53: 6629-6639), lymphoma kinase ALK inhibitors (Mesaros, E. F.; Thieu, T. V.; Wells, G. J. et al., J. Med. Chem., 2012, 55: 115-125), VEGFR-2/FGFR-1 dual inhibitors (Cai, Z.-w.; Zhang, Y.; Borzilleri, R. M. et al., J. Med. Chem., 2008, 5: 1976-1980), VEGFR-2 inhibitors (Hunt, J. T.; Mitt, T.; Borzilleri, R. et al., J. Med. Chem., 2004, 47: 4054-4059), EGFR1/2 inhibitors (Gavai, A. V.; Fink, B. E.; Fairfax, D. J. et al., J. Med. Chem., 2009, 52: 6527-6530), IGF-1R inhibitors (see: Wittman, M. D.; Carboni, J. M.; Yang, Z. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2009, 52: 7360-7363), or Met kinase inhibitors (see: Schroeder, G. M.; Chen, X.-T.; Williams, D. K. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2007, 18: 1945-1951). Moreover, compounds containing this pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine privileged structure such as EGFR inhibitor AC-480 (WO-2004054514), VEGF-2 receptor antagonist BMS-690514 (WO2005/066176A1), and IGF-1R antagonist BMS-754807 (US2008/0009497 A1) etc. have entered into the clinical studies. The synthetic methods for the core structure of pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine have also been reported, for example, Thieu, T; Sclafani, J. A.; Levy, D. V et al., Org. Lett., 2011, 13: 4204-4207. In addition to above mentioned literatures, there are many patent applications related to the core structure of pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine, for example, acting as kinase inhibitors (publication No.: US2006/0084650A1), EGFR kinase inhibitors (Publication No.: US2006/0089358A1, WO2006/069395), VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1 inhibitors (Publication No.: WO2004/009784, WO2004/043912), and patent applications related to the synthetic methods for intermediates (WO2007/005709, WO2008/083398), tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitors (WO2007/061882, WO2008/131050), Aurora kinase inhibitors (Publication Number: WO2009/136966), JAK kinase inhibitors (Publication No.: WO2010/002472). The reported pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazines mentioned above do not cover and relate to the compounds of the present invention and use thereof as PI3K inhibitors.
      Based on the aforementioned reasons, the inventors designed and synthesized a series of PI3K inhibitors with pyrrole[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine as core structure. The compounds in the present invention have demonstrated excellent bioactivity both in vitro and in vivo, and are expected to be developed into a novel anti-cancer medicament.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS
"
0002488598,"BACKGROUND ART
      Human growth hormone (HuGH) is a protein hormone secreted by human anterior pituitary gland, the precursor of which consists of 217 amino acid residues, wherein the first 26 amino acid residues compose a signal peptide, and the remaining 191 amino acid residues compose the mature molecule. There are two intra-molecular disulfide bonds (Cys79 and Cys191, Cys208 and Cys215), and the molecule is not glycosylated with a molecular weight of 22 kiloDaltons (kDa). The sequence of the HuGH is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 (NCBI: P01241, AAA72260; Denoto F M, et al. Human growth hormone DNA sequence and mRNA structure: possible alternative splicing. Nucleic Acids Res., 9: 3719-3730, 1981; Roskam W, et al. Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the human growth hormone structural gene. Nucleic Acids Res., 7: 305-320, 1979; Martial J A, et al. Human growth hormone: Complementary DNA cloning and expression in bacteria. Science, 205: 602-607, 1979; Chen E Y, et al. The human growth hormone locus: nucleotide sequence, biology and evolution. Genomics, 4: 479-497, 1989). The primary functions of the HuGH include promoting the growth of a cell, organ or bone, and it is closely related to the anabolism of the body (Iglesias P, et al. Recombinant human growth hormone therapy in malnourished dialysis patients: a randomized controlled study. Am. J. Kidney Dis., 32(3): 454-463, 1998; Neely E K, Use and abuse of human growth hormone. Annu. Rev. Med., 45:407-410, 1994). After more than 20 years' clinical application of the recombinant human growth hormone (rHuGH) produced by recombinant DNA technology, the clinical efficacy and safety of the rHuGH have been demonstrated.
      The results from many researches have indicated that, rHuGH shows significant therapeutic effects in treating dwarfism, burn, wound, bone fracture, bleeding ulcer, renal failure, AIDS, anabolic disorders, endogenous growth hormone deficiency dwarfism, Turner syndrome and adult growth hormone deficiency, and it also shows significant effect in anti-aging therapy. Currently rHuGH is the only effective drug for the treatment of dwarfism. By March 2001, the indications that have been approved by FDA to enter clinical research of rHuGH include: nitrogen retention intensive treatment of severe burn, short bowel syndrome (administered alone or in combination with glutamine), AIDS related growth arrest etc. Currently, the indications of rHuGH that have been approved for marketing include: adolescent endogenous growth hormone deficiency dwarfism, Turner syndrome related dwarfism, adolescent spontaneous or organ growth hormone deficiency dwarfism, Prader-Willi syndrome, premature growth disorder, AIDS related catabolic disorder, chronic renal failure related growth retardation and adult growth hormone deficiency etc.
      Polyethylene glycol is an inert, nontoxic and biodegradable organic polymer, and is important in the fields of both biotechnology and pharmaceutics. PEG modification technique is to link PEG to an active protein via covalent bond. After polyethylene-glycolation (PEGylation), the properties of the protein can be significantly improved, e.g. the prolongation of drug metabolic half-life, the reduction of immunogenicity, the increase of safety, the improvement of therapeutic efficacy, the decrease of dosing frequency, the increase of drug solubility/water solubility, the increase of resistance against proteolysis, the facilitation of drug controlled release and so on (Inada et al. J. Bioact. and Compatible Polymers, 5, 343, 1990; Delgado, et al. Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 9, 249, 1992; Katre, Advanced Drug Delivery Systems, 10, 91, 1993 and Davis et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337). It is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337 that after linking PEG to a protein such as an enzyme or insulin, the immunogenicity of the protein was reduced, while simultaneously the activities of the protein were reduced as well, but at the same time the modified protein retained a certain proportion of the activities of the original unmodified protein. Such effect was also found in G-CSF (Satake-Ishikawa et al. Cell Structure and Function, 17, 157-160, 1992), IL-2 (Katre et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 1487, 1987), TNF-α (Tsutsumi et al. Jpn. J Cancer Res., 85, 9, 1994), IL-6 (Inoue et al. J. Lab. Clin. Med., 124, 529, 1994) and CD4-IgG (Chamow et al. Bioconj. Chem., 5, 133, 1994).
      It is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,784 that a PEG modifier with an aldehyde group at the end was used to obtain a PEG-G-CSF which was modified by a single PEG at a fixed site (N-terminal amino acid of the protein). PEG-NHS modifier synthesized by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) activation can form an amido bond with ε-amino group of lysine in G-CSF. PEG-NHS has a high chemical activity but poor selectivity, and thus it is difficult to obtain a product modified by a single PEG at a fixed site. Comparing to a multi-PEGs modified product, mono-PEG modified product is more homogeneous and thus is beneficial for separation and purification, which therefore facilitates the quality control and ensures stability among batches in large-scale production.
      Currently some kinds of PEGylated therapeutic protein drugs, such as PEGylated-adenosine deaminase (ADAGEN®, Enzon Pharmaceuticals), PEGylated L-asparaginase (ONCAPSPAR®, Enzon Pharmaceuticals), PEGylated interferon-α2b (PEGINTRON™, Schering-Plough) and PEGylated interferon-α2a (Pegasys, Roche), PEGylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (NEULASTA®, Amgen), have been applied clinically. The in vivo metabolism of the PEG moiety in a drug (or PEG itself) has already been clearly understood, and PEG has been proven to be a good and safe drug modifier without any adverse effect.
      The PEG that can be linked to a protein drug normally need to be derivatized, so that one or two terminal groups at the ends of PEG can be chemically activated to possess a proper functional group which displays activity to, and thus can form a stable covalent bond with, at least one functional group of the drug to be linked. For example, PEG can be linked to ε-NH 2 of a Lys residue within the protein peptide chain, or to α-NH 2 of the N-terminal amino acid residue of the protein peptide chain. There are normally three forms of polyethylene glycols that have been used to modify a protein: a linear chain molecule (EP 0593868; Yu-Sen Wang et al. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 54: 547-570, 2002; Yu-Sen Wang et al. Biochemistry, 39, 10634-10640, 2000), U-shaped branched molecule (EP 0809996) and Y-shaped branched molecule (CN1243779C, EP1496076). The Europe Patent no. EP0809996 describes the PEGylation of IFN-α.
      It is generally believed in the art that, after PEG modification, the properties of most proteins will undergo the following changes: 1. the immunogenicity and antigenicity decrease; 2. the cyclic half-life is prolonged; 3. the solubility is increased; 4. the protein is tolerant to proteolysis; 5. the biological availability is increased; 6. the toxicity is decreased; 7. the thermostability and mechanical stability are increased; 8. The isoelectric point, electrophoretic behavior, and dynamic properties are changed, etc. Furthermore, one of the most important points is that PEG modification will result in the decrease of cellular activities of a protein, which is mainly due to the groups that have been introduced into the final product, including PEG and the linkages between PEG and the protein to be modified, and also related to the conditions of coupling as well as the generated side-product. Doris Brugger et al. (US Patent, Pub. No.: US 2004/0223950 A1) discloses that the modification products of interferon-α2a mono-modified by a single double stranded UPEG at one of different sites show significantly different in vitro anti-viral activities, wherein the modification product mono-modified by UPEG at site Lys31 has the highest specific activity, while the product mono-modified by UPEG at site Lys121 has the lowest specific activity, wherein the difference between both can be up to 5 times.
      Li, Weihua et al. (China Patent Pub. No.: CN 1477126A) discloses a method of preparing a PEG modified growth hormone. It is preferred to perform the modification reaction of growth hormone by branched PEG (mPEGn-NHS) at pH 6.5-7.0, and the biological activity of the purified growth hormone mono-modified by branched PEG at a single site was measured using rats with the pituitary glands removed. The results demonstrate that, PEG coupled growth hormone (wherein PEG is double stranded PEG-NHS with a molecular weight of 40 kDa) has comparable weight increasing effect to the equal amount of growth hormone injected daily.
